pomt-06208	"We have more natural gas in this country than Saudi Arabia has oil."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/08/jon-huntsman/jon-huntsman-says-us-has-more-natural-gas-saudi-ar/	The United States’ "addiction" to imported oil is a hot topic on many presidential candidates’ platforms. During a November editorial board meeting with the Telegraph in New Hampshire, former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman recycled some of that rhetoric when he discussed his push for energy independence in America. "I want to take some steps toward energy independence, which is completely doable," said Huntsman, who served as ambassador to China during the Barack Obama administration before he resigned to run for the Republican nomination for president. "We've talked about it under eight presidents. We've made very little in the way of positive forward momentum. We're still addicted to 60 percent imported oil, we have a transfer of wealth of 300 billion bucks a year to unfriendly transactional regimes in parts of the world. And I say, lets wake up to the fact that we have more natural gas in this country than Saudi Arabia has oil. And I say, how stupid are we?" More natural gas than all the oil in one of the world’s largest oil exporting nations? Really? We decided to break down Huntman’s comparison to find out. First, we contacted Huntsman’s campaign to get sources behind his energized claim, but the campaign didn’t return our calls or emails. We turned to the U.S. Energy Information Administration for a little guidance on what seemed like comparing apples to oranges. Steven Grape, an EIA expert in the Office of Oil, Gas, and Coal Supply Statistics, said the issue is even more complicated than we thought. First, it involves comparing energy sources that are measured differently. Oil supplies are calculated in barrels, while natural gas supplies are calculated in cubic feet. And the two fuels have different energy content, which means it takes still more math to compare them. Converting the energy content into the standard measure British thermal units, 1 trillion cubic feet of natural gas is equivalent to 165 million barrels of crude oil, according to Grape. On top of that, there are two different ways in which to look at how much of each type of energy is available. One way to look at it is as proved reserves, those that are likely to be developed under current economic and operating conditions. In other words, it's oil or natural gas that would be safe and profitable to produce now. Another, more uncertain approach to defining energy supply is to look at technically recoverable resources. These are resources that could be developed using current exploration and production technology, without regard to cost. Let's start with proved reserves. Saudi Arabia has 24 percent of the world’s proved reserves of crude oil, or about 264 billion barrels, Grape said. The U.S. proved reserves of natural gas are 284 trillion cubic feet. So the U.S. proved reserves are equal in energy content to about 46.8 billion barrels of oil -- considerably less than Saudi Arabia's proved reserves of oil. The technically recoverable resource estimates for Saudi Arabia could be as high as 700 billion barrels of crude oil, and the technically recoverable resource estimate for the United States is about 2,500 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, which is equivalent to 412.5 billion barrels of oil. That's still less than the 700 billion barrel resource estimate for Saudi Arabia. But Huntsman would be correct if he was speaking about production, Grape said. "We don’t have more natural gas in this country than Saudi Arabia has oil, but we produce more natural gas in this country per year than Saudi Arabia produces oil." The U.S. produces the equivalent of 12.14 million barrels per day, compared with Saudi Arabia's 9.8 million barrels of oil per day, Grape said. Our ruling We don't know whether Huntsman meant "proved" resources, estimates of technically recoverable resources or production totals when comparing U.S. gas to Saudi oil. Using the first two measures, his numbers fall short. If he was talking about production, he is correct, although Huntsman used the word "has," and not "produces." We rule his claim Mostly False.

pomt-09435	"House Appropriations Chair David Obey's partial earmark ban wouldn't apply to 90% of earmarks."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/12/jim-demint/sen-jim-demint-says-obeys-partial-earmark-ban-woul/	No sooner had Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., chairman of the House Appropriations panel, announced a plan to ban earmarks to for-profit companies than Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., sent out a blast of one-upmanship via Twitter. "House Appropriations Chair David Obey's partial earmark ban wouldn't apply to 90% of earmarks," DeMint wrote. "That's a fig leaf, not real reform." While Congress has steadily moved toward tighter earmark restrictions over the last several years, the issue has taken on renewed steam in light of the massive budget deficit and several high-profile ethics investigations. On Feb. 26, the House ethics committee absolved seven members of the defense spending panel accused of awarding earmarks to companies whose executives and lobbyists donated to their campaigns. Although they were cleared, the ethics committee said it was evident there was at least a perception among corporate donors that political donations have an impact on a legislator's decision to author an earmark for that company. It was just that kind of conflict that Rep. Obey said he was trying to eliminate when on March 10, 2010, he initiated a ban on budget earmarks to private, for-profit companies. The move -- one of several earmark reforms Obey instituted for the House -- was hailed by several government watchdog groups as a meaningful step for earmark reform. "For-profit company earmarks are ground zero for pay-to-play," said Steve Ellis of the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense. But what about DeMint's Twitter claim that Obey's "partial earmark ban wouldn't apply to 90% of earmarks." By Obey's calculation (or more accurately, the research of his House Appropriation Committee staff) the ban on earmarks to for-profit companies would have eliminated about 1,000 earmarks this year, which came to a total of about $1.7 billion. Taxpayers for Common Sense, which looked not only at the roughly 9,000 disclosed earmarks this fiscal year but also pored through the budget and came up with several hundred more projects it deemed to be earmarks, put the total number of earmarks at 9,499, totaling $15.9 billion. That puts the number of earmarks not going to for-profits awfully close to DeMint's 90 percent. Democrats don't really take issue with that statistic. It's what citing that figure implies, as well as the follow-up comment that Obey's ban of earmarks to for-profits is "a fig leaf, not real reform." ''The political reality right now is that the public has lost some confidence in this institution, and one of the reasons is the past abuses of the earmark process,'' Obey told the New York Times. Earmarks for profit-making companies are ''the most vulnerable place'' for abuse in the system, he said. "It's a step forward," Ellis said. "It's not the answer, the be-all-end-all. But I'm not going to look a gift horse in the mouth. It's real. We've been making progress on earmarks for several years now. And I'm fine with that. I'm not going to let the perfect be the enemy of the good." The day after Obey announced the changes, House Republicans went one step further, saying their members would renounce all earmarks for the rest of the year. In the Senate, however, banning any earmarks has much less traction. Senate Appropriations panel chair Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, Obey's Senate counterpart and a staunch defender of earmarks, called Obey's ban on earmarks to for-profits "quizzical." "Many, if not most, for-profit and nonprofit entities lobby for themselves or employ lobbyists," Inouye told AP. "That is how most of them make the Congress aware of their products and services. It is no secret that many of these individuals make political contributions. All lobbyists file disclosure reports. These contributions are all fully disclosed and available for all to see on the Internet." Inouye told the New York Times that the partial ban amounted to Congress ceding its authority to the executive branch, that current earmark restrictions were already working and that ''it does not make sense to discriminate against for-profit organizations'' by banning earmarks to them. A difference in earmark policy between the two chambers would certainly make for some interesting drama when the House and Senate begin to reconcile spending bills later this year. But DeMint, a self-described "recovering earmarker," would like to nip this issue in the bud now. DeMint vowed to force a Senate vote on a proposal he introduced earlier this year -- along with Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., and 15 Republican co-sponsors -- that would put a one-year moratorium on all earmarks. In the run-up to the 2008 presidential election, DeMint floated a similar moratorium proposal. The bill was co-sponsored by then-presidential front-runners John McCain as well as Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, but it failed by a vote of 71-29. "The Senate will have the opportunity this week to stand with Americans and put a stop to this wasteful spending," DeMint said. "Our nation is drowning in debt that will be paid by our children and we’ll never stop Washington’s spending addiction unless members of both parties take bold action. We need to focus on balancing the budget, not pork barrel spending that has wasted money on bridges to nowhere, teapot museums and monuments to politicians." Obey told the New York Times that banning all earmarks would make Congress ''a rubber stamp'' of the executive branch. ''Where I come from, the Congress has a perfect right, in fact an obligation, to participate in the budget process, but we've got to try to do it in a way that protects the integrity of the system,'' he said. ''This strikes a reasonable balance.'' Ellis, of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said a one-year moratorium is great, "but to what end?" A moratorium puts off the issue for a year, he said, but Congress still needs a long-term fix to its spending protocol. Some of the projects financed by earmarks are worthy of federal dollars, Ellis said. The problem, he said, is that earmarks are based more on the political muscle of their sponsors than project merit. We think DeMint is a little too dismissive when he calls Obey's ban on earmarks to for-profits a "fig leaf." As the recent ethics report found, private companies certainly believe their contributions win them earmarks. And it's naive to think they don't. So at the very least, Obey's plan addresses some of the worst abuses of the earmark process head-on. But the fact we're checking here is whether eliminating those for-profit earmarks would leave 90 percent of earmarks untouched. It would. There are differences of opinion on both sides of the aisle about whether that's necessarily a bad thing. But DeMint's math is accurate. And we rate his statement True.

pomt-10911	"Between the first and second quarters of 2018 — after the tax cuts were enacted — real wages fell by 1.8 percent."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/aug/01/nancy-pelosi/did-wages-fall-18-percent-after-donald-trumps-tax-/	Democrats have countered President Donald Trump’s message of positive economic growth by trying to highlight parts of the economy that haven’t been so strong on his watch. Recently, Democrats found a potent example: wage stagnation. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was among a number of Democrats and liberal groups that shared this assertion about wages following the passage of Trump’s tax cut. On July 26, she tweeted a link to a Vox.com article, adding: Paul Ryan on June 24th: "Wages are rising." Reality: "Between the first and second quarters of 2018 — after the tax cuts were enacted — real wages fell by 1.8 percent." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Others who tweeted the same talking point included the Democratic Governors Association and the Fight for 15 coalition, which pushes for a higher minimum wage. The talking point about plummeting wages is at best outdated, given the release of new information. In addition, the data cited is not one of several official measurements, and it appears to be a statistical outlier. Where the number comes from The statistic reached its widest audience after Vox published an article citing it July 23. The finding was previously noted in a Bloomberg column July 18 and, even earlier, in a CBS News article July 11. The first thing to know is that the wage data in question did not come from longstanding government statistical series. Rather, it came from the PayScale Index, a calculation made by a private group. That doesn’t necessarily mean it’s a problematic source, but it does mean that it needs to be weighed against the wage statistics compiled by the federal government, which are considered the gold standard. When the 1.8 percent decline first hit the media, official statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics were not available for that same quarter — the second quarter of 2018. However, by the time Democrats and their allies began tweeting about the PayScale data, the second-quarter BLS data had become publicly available. When we looked at a standard BLS measurement for wages — median usual weekly inflation-adjusted earnings for full-time wage and salary workers — we found that this measurement actually rose slightly between the first and second quarter of 2018, from $350 a week to $351 a week. That's an increase of less than three tenths of 1 percent, rather than down by 1.8 percent. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com What other measures show Gary Burtless, a Brookings Institution economist, suggested three additional BLS statistics to consult: average hourly earnings for all private employees; hourly earnings for manufacturing; and the employment cost index for private industry workers. Burtless adjusted each of these statistics for inflation and created an index showing how much each of the four wage measures had increased since the end of 2007. (In his system, the final data point of 2007 is pegged at 100, with any subsequent number above 100 showing how much it rose compared to the 2007 reference point.) Here’s his final graph. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Key: Blue = average real hourly earnings of all private employers; red = hourly earnings for manufacturing; green = median usual weekly real earnings for full-time wage and salary workers; purple = employment cost index: wages and salaries for private industry. Generally speaking, the four BLS statistics have moved in tandem, showing wage increases above inflation since 2014, with a bit of a slowdown since 2016. At worst, wages are going sideways or moving slightly higher in the most recent quarter — not suddenly crashing, as the PayScale data indicated. "I don’t think there’s any evidence I would trust that inflation-adjusted wages have declined noticeably, either over the entire Trump administration or in the period since Congress passed the new tax law," Burtless said. Dean Baker, an economist with the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, concurred. "It’s certainly fair to say real wages are not rising rapidly, and depending on the index chosen and the exact time period, they could even be falling slightly, but there is no plausible story where they fell 1.8 percent between the first and second quarter," Baker said. A spokesman for Pelosi said the tweet -- which was written by staff, not Pelosi -- "quotes word for word" from the Vox article and attached the link "for full context and openness." PayScale, for its part, acknowledges that comparing the PayScale Index to other BLS statistics "is comparing apples to pears." In a blog post, the company’s chief economist and vice president of data analytics, Katie Bardaro, wrote that the PayScale Index is designed to capture how workers’ wages change as they switch companies, while a BLS measure like the Employment Cost Index does not. She concluded, "Be careful of spurious comparisons of distinct measures and be sure to understand the underlying methodology of any metric you bring into your data arsenal." Our ruling Pelosi tweeted, "Between the first and second quarters of 2018 — after the tax cuts were enacted — real wages fell by 1.8 percent." There's a grain of truth, in that one unofficial measurement did produce that finding. But it is an outlier. Official statistics contradicted that, showing stable or modestly rising wages. Those were available before the recent social media traffic. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-06257	"We have had some significant accomplishments on a bipartisan basis."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/nov/29/john-kasich/ohio-gov-john-kasich-says-key-legislation-has-won-/	Gov. John Kasich often laments how partisan Ohio politics have become. The Republican leader typically blames Democrats for not having an open mind to at least consider his ideas. Democrats, of course, beg to differ. They blame what they call the governor’s ultra-conservative agenda for causing needless division. And at the top of their list is Senate Bill 5, the controversial collective bargaining law that voters overwhelmingly chose to repeal earlier this month. There’s no doubt that SB5, from the time it was introduced in February, has been the most divisive piece of legislation the state has seen in years. After a bitter referendum campaign launched by Democrats and unions, voters trounced the Kasich-backed law on Nov. 8 by 22 points. Since then, the governor has tried to quickly turn the page. He still won’t talk much about the defeat. But he is trying to heal the divide by reminding Ohioans that partisanship has not always ruled the day during his first 10 months in office. "We have had some significant accomplishments on a bipartisan basis," Kasich said on Election Night, conceding the loss of Issue 2, the Senate Bill 5 referendum. "And you all know that I’m interested in trying to do things as often as we can with members of the other party." Was Kasich giving an accurate picture of the record, or was he trying to limit the potential political fallout from losing on a signature piece of legislation? PolitiFact Ohio decided to check. Certainly, Republicans and Democrats have been far apart on a number of initiatives the governor has ushered through with the help of a compliant GOP-controlled legislature, including his controversial state budget that cut aid to schools and communities. Democrats also have opposed Kasich’s efforts to privatize some state operations, and they panned the governor’s rejection of more than $400 million in federal funding for a new passenger train system. But Kasich will tell you that he has won bipartisan support on his proposals for prison sentencing reform, business regulatory reforms, business tax credits, and reining in so-called prescription pill mills. And indeed he has. — House Bill 93 cracks down on pain management clinics and punishes doctors who over-prescribe prescription medication, a huge problem in Southern Ohio. Both the Ohio House and Senate unanimously passed the bill, which Kasich has signed into law. — House Bill 86 will allow some felons to get out of prison early and others to skip prison altogether. Judges will have the discretion to send non-violent offenders to halfway houses instead of prisons and some felons who have served at least 80 percent of their sentences can be released. It passed the Senate 30 to 3 and the House 87 to 9, with support from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. — House Bill 58 expands the job retention tax credit program and allows for other tax incentives for businesses. The governor used this program to help keep American Greetings in Northeast Ohio after the company said it was considering moving its headquarters to Illinois. With an emergency clause to allow the bill to become law immediately, it passed the Senate 31 to 1 and House 89 to 6. The governor’s regulatory reform measure that, among other things, requires state agencies with a role in economic development to review and adjust rules that are considered a hindrance to business development, and his JobsOhio program that turns job creation over to a private board appointed by the governor also both received bipartisan support. These are significant pieces of legislation. And each received a healthy dose of Democratic, as well as Republican, support. Some Ohioans may have forgotten about these new laws, which no one is trying to repeal. But the governor has not. We rate Kasich’s statement as True.

pomt-02384	In the recent House special election in Florida, Democrats "got outspent in a Republican district."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/mar/14/democratic-national-committee/democrats-say-alex-sink-got-outspent-republican-di/	The votes in the special election for Florida’s 13th Congressional District were barely in before the blame game began. On March 11, 2013, Republican David Jolly defeated Democrat Alex Sink in the high-profile Pinellas County race to fill the seat of the late Republican Rep. C.W. Bill Young. Shortly after Sink lost, the Democratic National Committee sent out a fundraising email signed by the DNC’s CEO, Amy K. Dacey. In it, Dacey called the result "really scary" because "Republican super PACs and outside groups rode to the rescue of a straight-up corporate lobbyist (Jolly) -- spending $5 million to tear down his Democratic opponent." After urging recipients of the email to "chip in $3 or more," Dacey offered an analysis of the outcome: "In a district that Republicans have held for almost six decades, we nearly pulled off an incredible upset thanks to grassroots support from Democrats like you -- but we fell short for one reason: We got outspent in a Republican district. And call me old fashioned, but I think people, and not special interests, should decide elections." We wondered whether the DNC is correct to say that Democrats "got outspent in a Republican district." We’ll address the claim in two parts. Did Democrats get outspent? Some money in campaigns is raised and spent by the candidate. Other funds are spent by outside groups, ranging from state parties to labor unions to the National Rifle Association. To fully understand how much money is sloshing around a particular race, you have to include both types. You also have to combine the money spent to promote a candidate with that spent to attack their opponent. Michael Beckel -- a reporter with the Center for Public Integrity, a nonpartisan group that tracks money in politics -- looked at how much the candidates reported raising and spending in their official Federal Election Commission disclosures through Feb. 19, the last pre-election filing date. He then looked at the amounts they reported raising when they filed more limited "48-hour" reports through election day. Finally, Beckel added the amounts spent by outside groups. Beckel’s total? About $6.4 million for "Team Sink," and about $6.3 million for "Team Jolly." "Both Democrats and Republicans went all-in," Beckel told PolitiFact. "Neither side can claim to have been outgunned." This is not to say there weren’t differences in where the two campaigns’ financial support came from. And those are relevant points when checking the DNC’s comment. When we checked with the DNC, they noted that spending by outside groups tilted toward Jolly. They are correct. Here’s a summary of both outside spending and candidate spending in the special election, using data from the Center for Responsive Politics. (It differs slightly from Beckel’s calculations, but is generally similar.) Data through Feb. 19 Pro-Sink Pro-Jolly Outside spending $3,752,057 $5,070,604 Candidate spending $1,569,762 $857,997 Total spending $5,321,819 $5,928,601 This shows that Jolly benefited from a level of outside spending that was about 35 percent higher than what Sink benefited from. By contrast, Sink outraised Jolly in money that her own campaign raised. She raised about 80 percent more than Jolly did. On balance, Jolly and the outside groups that supported him did outspend Sink and her allies by about $600,000 -- an 11 percent edge, give or take. But this isn’t the whole story. As we noted, this data on spending stops at Feb. 19, a point several weeks before the election. Stopping here ignores what each candidate had in their war chest -- much of which they would presumably want to spend through the election. So we also looked at what each of the candidates had as "cash on hand" -- essentially, money that hadn’t been spent yet. Here’s what we found: Data through Feb. 19 Pro-Sink Pro-Jolly Candidate + outside spending $5,321,819 $5,928,601 Cash on Hand $971,587 $182,189 Spending plus cash on hand $6,293,406 $6,110,790 So, adding in cash on hand that was likely to be spent before election day, the advantage shifts to "Team Sink." This data suggests that her financial position was no worse in this election than Jolly’s, and perhaps a little better. And that would undercut the DNC’s point that she "got outspent." "Jolly’s campaign may have been sunk without outside groups coming to his aid, but that’s only part of the story," Beckel said. "Thanks to outside group activity on both sides, neither candidate was outgunned. Both Democrats and Republicans made huge investments in the race." Is Florida’s 13th a Republican district? On this question, too, the data is mixed. On the one hand, the district's party registration breakdown is 170,402 Republicans and 159,022 Democrats (plus 111,114 without a party affiliation). The seat had been held (with some variations in its borders) by Young, a Republican, for 44 years. In recent years, his worst re-election margin was 57 percent of the vote. And a widely used method for characterizing the political leanings of districts -- the Cook Political Report’s Partisan Voting Index -- calls the 13th a "Republican +2" district, which means that during the previous two presidential elections, the district voted an average of 2 points more Republican than the nation did as a whole. But other factors suggest that calling the 13th a "Republican district" is an exaggeration. Since voters do not always vote in lockstep with their party, Democrats have fared well in the 13th in recent years. Barack Obama won the district in 2008 by nearly 4 percentage points, and in 2012 by 1.4 percentage points. Sink won the district both during her losing gubernatorial bid in 2010 and her successful run for chief financial officer in 2006. Given this, Young’s margins of victory are an outlier that have more to do with his long tenure as an incumbent. And a district that is "Republican +2" places it near the exact partisan middle of the House of Representatives. In the world of political handicappers, this means the 13th is a quintessential "competitive" or "swing" district, not a Republican one. "It's about as evenly divided as you can get," said David Wasserman, who analyzes House races for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. "We thought this district was competitive before the election, and we still think it’s a competitive district after the election," agreed Nathan Gonzales, who analyzes races for the similarly nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report. Our ruling In a fundraising letter after the Florida special election, the Democratic National Committee said Democrats "got outspent in a Republican district." Both claims have a grain of truth, but are exaggerated. By the Feb. 19 cutoff for disclosure -- a few weeks before the election was held -- Jolly and his supporters had outspent Sink and her supporters. But if you take into account Sink’s big advantage in banked money -- dollars she was likely to spend in the race’s final weeks -- that edge disappears, and "Team Sink" takes a narrow overall lead. Meanwhile, nonpartisan analysts agree that the district is more accurately labeled "toss-up" than "Republican" in its partisan leanings. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False.

New rumors have circulated on the Internet that Cyrus is now revisiting that promise and that Trump fans are ruining her career. "Singer Miley Cyrus: ‘Trump fans are destroying my career, I can’t stand them and I decided to move to…’" read the headline on Daily Washington Report, a blog providing no information about the nature of its content. The story was flagged by Facebook users as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. The story cites real quotes by Cyrus from an interview she gave to Billboard magazine in 2017 where she openly spoke about becoming more political following the 2016 election. But the story then makes up new information regarding comments about Trump supporters. In the article, Cyrus claims to be dissatisfied with her career and blames Trump supporters for her not being a top-selling artist anymore. We found no evidence that Cyrus ever made those comments. Cyrus is also falsely quoted as saying that she believes the amount of hate she has received has to do with Trump supporters and that she will leave the United States if it continues. When searching for the quotes attributed to Cyrus, we found no results of the statements. Celebrity news fact-checking site Gossip Cop also confirmed that Cyrus never accused Trump supporters of hurting her album sales. We did find an actual recent interview with Wonderland Magazine where Cyrus was featured on the cover. In that interview, she talked about expanding her career to work on different project, and being in a good place in her life right now. Cyrus’s latest album, Younger Now, released in September 2017, hit a peak of No. 3 on the Billboard charts. Even though last year Cyrus threatened to leave the United States if Trump was elected president, she recently backtracked, calling it "ignorant" to leave the country because of the president. Our ruling A fake news story said that Miley Cyrus is blaming Trump supporters for her discontentment with her career and that she is planning to leave the United States. Cyrus has recently expressed satisfaction of her career and life, and she specifically reversed her prior feelings on leaving the country. We rate this claim False.

pomt-03779	Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed held not one conversation with the public about the new Falcons stadium project	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/apr/01/william-perry/watchdog-says-reed-didnt-talk-public-about-stadium/	The Falcons are thisclose to having a clear path for a new stadium built in downtown Atlanta. The team and city officials reached agreement on a deal for the almost $1 billion stadium a few weeks ago. Already, the Georgia World Congress Center Authority (which will own the stadium) and the Atlanta City Council have OK’d the deal, which includes using $200 million in city hotel-motel taxes toward construction costs and potentially several times that amount toward financing, maintaining and operating the stadium through 2050. All that’s left is approval from Invest Atlanta, the city’s development authority. In the meantime, ethics watchdog William Perry criticized Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed for rushing the deal, and not allowing enough time for public input. "Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed was quoted in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution as saying Atlanta would have a ‘big public conversation.’" We would get an information blitz, he said. But the mayor held not one conversation with the public," said Perry, executive director of government watchdog group Common Cause Georgia. Not one? PolitiFact Georgia has examined several other claims about the stadium deal, including some that were made during meetings about the project. We decided to walk backward through time and examine the weeks leading up to the stadium deal announcement. Perry’s statement appeared last month in an opinion piece for Creative Loafing Atlanta two days after the Atlanta City Council approved the stadium funding plan. A Feb. 8 AJC article quoted Reed as promising "a big public conversation" about the new stadium. "We’re going to give the public every piece of data that we can possibly give them. Everything is going to be known," the mayor went on to say. "Questions are going to be answered in public and on television." The City Council vote came late on a Monday evening after hours of debate between council members. The meeting was public and televised. Reed attended that council session and spoke to the body about the project. But his attendance there -- nor at any other council meeting -- doesn’t qualify as the mayor holding a public conversation on the issue, Perry told PolitiFact Georgia. The Atlanta City Council held several public meetings or work sessions convened by either the chairwoman of the finance executive committee or the council president, Perry said. But none of them were initiated by Reed or his office. We checked with the City Council, and Felicia Moore, who heads the committee that handled the stadium deal, sent us a list of all seven council meetings involving the project. According to Moore’s list, the first meeting was held Feb. 13, and it ended with a committee work session on March 21, three days after the full council approved the deal. The mayor or a representative from his office attended each of the meetings, according to Moore’s notes. The meetings were open to the public, but visitors were only allowed to speak at some of the meetings. "The mayor’s office did not schedule any of those meetings," Moore told PolitiFact Georgia. She was one of four council members who opposed the final funding plan. Moore told her council colleagues that they needed to take time to further vet the deal that will impact the city for at least the next 50 years. Once a proposal was crafted, and before the council and other groups voted, Perry thought there would be public meetings held so people could read through the document and give testimony, he said. "The bottom line is if you’re trying to ramrod something through, the way to do that is to have less public conversation about it. I don’t feel like he lived up to the promise of an information blitz." We took Perry’s claim to Reed’s office, and his spokeswoman, Sonji Jacobs, blitzed us with information contradicting the watchdog leader. She called Perry’s claim "blatantly false and misleading." Jacobs’ three-page report to PolitiFact Georgia detailed the same council meetings that were on Moore’s list, along with meetings held by the GWCCA and Invest Atlanta, of which Reed is the chairman. The meetings were open to the public, and some were broadcast on the city’s cable television station and city website. (Perry says he sent a letter to Reed in February requesting a public forum. He did not receive a response, and was initially reassured by the mayor’s promise of an information blitz.) The meetings were not initiated by Reed’s office. Jacobs said that’s not the way things work with Atlanta’s city governance. "The mayor’s office doesn’t organize meetings. We conduct our meetings in concert with council, which enables us to engage the council and the public in a more efficient manner," Jacobs said. Holding a duplicate set of meetings hosted by the mayor would be wasteful and inefficient, Jacobs said. That process holds true with not only the City Council, but also community groups, and city entities like the GWCCA. The mayor or one of his senior staff attends those meetings, presents information and answers questions of the public or other officials, as has happened during annual budget deliberations, for example. One of the few occasions that Reed has initiated a public meeting was a town hall meeting in 2010 introducing the three police chief candidates to the public. With the new stadium project, no one, or no group, asked Reed’s office to hold a town hall meeting, Jacobs said. Reed and Perry have gotten into verbal fisticuffs before. PolitiFact Georgia examined a claim last January by Perry that Atlanta had established a convoluted process for awarding airport concession contracts. Earlier that same month, we checked a claim by Reed that some Common Cause Georgia members had accepted maximum campaign contributions even though the group criticized the contributions given to Reed by airport vendors. We checked with political science professors, and the issue falls into a gray area. Typically mayors don’t hold public hearings, they are usually done in conjunction with the legislative body (city council) or other department or agency, said Michael Rich, assistant professor of political science at Emory University. But there are other methods of communicating with the public other than town hall meetings and forums, such as establishing a website for comments and soliciting written comments. And in instances involving highly controversial issues, Rich said, mayors have sometimes initiated the public meetings. So, does Perry score a touchdown -- or at least a field goal -- with his claim that Mayor Reed did not hold one conversation with the public leading up to the new Falcons stadium deal? Hard to say. There were meetings held, most of the meetings were open to the public and many were televised and streamed on the city’s website. Reed used the collective "we" in describing the information blitz that would be provided on the stadium plan. It is typically the legislative branch of government that initiates public meetings -- in this case the Atlanta City Council -- and not the executive branch, or mayor’s office. The mayor or at least one of his senior staff did attend stadium meetings held by the City Council and other city entities. But the mayor did not initiate any of those meetings. And Reed did not host any town hall meetings in the communities that will be impacted most by the stadium. Perry has a point -- Reed could have done a lot more to engage the public in person. But Perry’s statement needs a lot of context to be fully understood. We rated Perry’s statement Half True.	None	William Perry	None	None	None	2013-04-01T07:44:43	2013-03-20	['Kasim_Reed', 'Atlanta']
pomt-13729	"The approval of the United States was 20 points higher when (Hillary Clinton) left the secretary of state's office than when she took it."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/27/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-exaggerates-increase-world-opinion-us/	During Bill Clinton’s Democratic convention speech about Hillary Clinton, the former president touted his wife’s efforts as secretary of state to improve the levels of support for the United States across the globe. He cited his wife as "one of the reasons the approval of the United States was 20 points higher when she left the secretary of state's office than when she took it." We decided to check whether the approval ratings he cited were accurate. We found four surveys that asked questions on a regular basis about how the United States is seen in other countries. We’ll go through them one by one. Pew Research Center We found Pew data for surveys taken in 20 countries between 2008 and 2013. Respondents were asked, "Please tell me if you have a very favorable, somewhat favorable, somewhat unfavorable or very unfavorable opinion of the United States." The figures in the chart below show the change in the favorable ratings -- either up or down -- between 2008, the year before Clinton became secretary of state, and 2013, the year she stepped down from the post. The countries are listed in descending order from the most positive change to the most negative change during her tenure. Country Change in approval of U.S., 2008-13* Spain +29 Indonesia +24 Germany +22 France +22 Australia +20 Argentina +19 Japan +19 Mexico +19 South Africa +12 Tanzania +10 Turkey +9 South Korea +8 Russia +5 United Kingdom +5 Poland -1 China -1 Lebanon -4 Jordan -5 Egypt -6 Pakistan -8 Median country, not weighted for population +10 * except Tanzania, which is for the years 2008 to 2014 So eight countries met or came close to the 20-point increase Clinton cited, but 12 did not. Taking into account the whole list of 20 countries, the median change for the countries surveyed was a gain of 10 percentage points. That’s a significant increase, but it’s not the 20 percentage-point increase Clinton cited. BBC As we have previously noted, the BBC World Service/Globescan survey undertakes an annual country ratings poll that asks about respondents’ view of various countries’ "influence in the world" -- either "mostly positive" or "mostly negative." In 2008, the poll found that 35 percent of people said world influence of the United States was "mostly positive" and 47 percent said it was "mostly negative." In the late 2012-early 2013 poll, that number had risen to 45 percent. That’s an increase of 10 percentage points during Clinton’s tenure -- in line with the median country in the Pew survey, but still half of what Bill Clinton said. Gallup Finally, every year, Gallup has asked respondents in various countries, "Do you approve or disapprove of the job performance of the leaders" of various countries, including the United States. In 2008, the United States had a 34 percent approval rating. By 2013, that had risen to 46 percent. That’s an increase of 12 percentage points -- once again, roughly in line with the Pew and BBC polls and less than what Clinton said. Meridian International Center When we asked the Clinton campaign for supporting evidence, they pointed to a survey by the Meridian International Center and Gallup’s U.S.-Global Leadership Project. Between 2008 and 2013, they said, the median U.S. approval rating in Europe grew from 18 percent to 41 percent. That’s a 23-point increase--but it’s also just for Europe, a limitation Clinton didn’t specify. And the data for Asia in the same poll and the same time frame, according to the campaign, showed an increase from 31 percent to 45 percent. That’s a rise of 14 points, which is less than the 20-point benchmark Clinton used. So we don’t see the Meridian International Center data as supporting Clinton’s assertion. Our ruling Bill Clinton said, "The approval of the United States was 20 points higher when (Hillary Clinton) left the secretary of state's office than when she took it." The approval ratings for the United States did go up on Hillary Clinton’s watch, and the Pew poll found that in some countries they did go up by 19 points or more. Still, the median increase in the Pew polling was a more modest 10 points, and the increases in the BBC and Gallup polls were in the same ballpark -- 10 to 12 points. On balance, we rate Clinton’s claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/346ff278-87b9-465c-8627-958fae7a7561	None	Bill Clinton	None	None	None	2016-07-27T00:33:38	2016-07-26	['United_States', 'Hillary_Rodham_Clinton']
pomt-11055	Florida taxpayers "pay tens of millions of dollars a year to feed and house in our prison system criminal illegal aliens."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2018/jun/26/adam-putnam/do-florida-taxpayers-pay-tens-millions-dollars-yea/	In an interview with Fox News, Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam outlined his approach to illegal immigration if elected governor of Florida. Florida has to act, Putnam said, because illegal immigration comes at a steep cost. Putnam touted his Secure Florida First Agenda, which includes establishing a community deportation system with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. "In other words, Florida should have that relationship with ICE because Florida taxpayers are sick of paying tens of millions of dollars a year to feed and house in our prison system criminal illegal aliens who ought to be in the custody of the feds and oughta be deported," Putnam said June 7. The economic impact of immigration is widely debated, so we wanted to take a look at Putnam’s statement. We found it’s uncertain how much money "illegal" immigrants in Florida prisons cost taxpayers. That’s because Florida doesn’t keep tabs on whether inmates are in the country legally or illegally. Flaws in Putnam’s evidence Putnam campaign spokeswoman Meredith Beatrice said that there are two ways to calculate the "tens of millions" dollar figure he is referring to. The problem, though, is that his calculation for "illegal immigrants" includes inmates who are not U.S. citizens but are in the country legally. Putnam’s team multiplied the total state Department of Corrections budget ($2.3 billion) by the percent of "criminal illegal aliens" in Florida’s prisons, which Putnam said was 4.8 percent. That 4.8 percent of Corrections budget is roughly $110 million. In the second calculation, Putnam multiplied the average cost to incarcerate an inmate for a day ($55.80, according to the Florida Department Of Corrections) by the number of days in a year. Then he multiplied that total ($20,367) by the number of "criminal illegal immigrants" in Florida prisons, which he said was 4,754. That works out to around $96.8 million. But terminology matters. Putnam is referring to that 4,754 figure as all "illegal aliens," but in fact the state prison system labels them simply "aliens." That might sound like a small difference, but it isn’t. The term "aliens" actually refers to all people who are not U.S. citizens, those who arrived both legally and illegally. The state of Florida only keeps a count of all aliens. According to the Florida Department of Corrections, "the vast majority of alien inmates" are released to ICE for further immigration processing, including possible deportation. It's possible undocumented immigrants make up a good share of the "alien" population, but Putnam still would have no way of knowing the exact numbers. "If the state of Florida doesn’t track illegal immigrants in prison (they don’t) then that number is not knowable," said Cato analyst Alex Nowrasteh. Another problem is that even if 4.8 percent of the prison population were released from the prison system, it does not mean it would have a direct 4.8 percent reduction on the total budget because of fixed costs, such as the cost to keep a prison running and administrative and security costs. Bryce Peterson, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute, said that reducing a small number of people from the prison will only really reduce the cost of clothing, food and direct health care service to that individual. "If they were to release all 5 percent of those people that’s probably not going to be enough to start laying off people and closing prison," Peterson said. "It's unrealistic to think it's going to have a direct five percent impact on their total budget." Our ruling Putnam said Florida taxpayers "pay tens of millions of dollars a year to feed and house in our prison system criminal illegal aliens." Putnam's estimates for how much undocumented immigrants in prisons cost Florida taxpayers have several major problems. For starters, the state only tracks inmates who are not U.S. citizens, without diving into whether they are in the country legally or illegally. Even if we had the right numbers, experts told us that fixed costs for the prisons mean reducing the population yields uncertain cost savings. Eliminating a small percentage of inmates doesn’t mean the overall prison budget can be reduced by the same percentage. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-12878	Says Barack "Obama orders life-sized bronze statue of himself to be permanently installed in White House."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/jan/27/blog-posting/fake-news-theres-no-bronze-statue-president-barack/	A fake story that claimed President Barack Obama was installing a pricey statue of himself in the White House before he left office has gone bust under a smidge of scrutiny. "Obama orders life-sized bronze statue of himself to be permanently installed in White House," read headlines across several websites in January. The latest version we saw was on Jan. 18, 2017, two days before Donald Trump’s inauguration, but there were many other examples. The story was flagged by Facebook as being potentially fabricated, as part of Facebook’s effort to limit the impact of fake news on readers’ news feeds. In the posts, Obama is quoted as praising his own record and saying he commissioned the $200,000 bronze statue (repeatedly spelled "statute," as in a law or rule) to preserve his legacy. He wanted the statue "permanently erected in the entryway of the White House," the article asserted. Some versions included the image above, purportedly of the statue standing watch in the Oval Office. Clearly, the article is contrived. We could find no credible mention of an Obama statue being put in or near the front door of the White House. The source of this false account is a Dec. 31, 2016, post on EmpireNews.net. The website says it is "intended for entertainment purposes only," and that its content can’t be reproduced without consent. We didn’t hear back from the website when we asked whether permission had been granted to any other outlets. There is a real Obama statue, and it is actually bronze. But it’s not anywhere in the White House. It’s along the "avenue of heroes" near Puerto Rico’s Capitol building in San Juan, where the statue was installed in 2012. Every president who has visited Puerto Rico gets a statue there; Obama took a trip to the commonwealth in 2011. The image currently on the original EmpireNews.net post is a photo from the Flickr account of a photographer named Paul Sableman, and is dated Jan. 8, 2013. It looks like hoaxsters combined the statue image with a photo of the Oval Office. But even the background is not the Oval Office. It’s really a photo from the U.K.’s Mirror of a replica created by a Longview, Texas, man named Ron Wade. Wade reportedly spent $250,000 to build a facsimile of the Oval Office at 80 percent scale. The composite doesn’t even feature Obama’s decor — the absence of his chunky mica coffee table was the giveaway. While EmpireNews.net labels itself a joke website in a disclaimer, there’s no evidence of that in the faux story. That’s doubly true when other sites then share the story. The addition of the composite image made from misappropriated photographs only heightens the deceit. We’ve chiseled out the details to cast our own decision.

pomt-09942	On calling Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor a racist.	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jun/03/newt-gingrich/gingrich-reverses-calling-sotomayor-racist/	Editor's Note: This is the first time we've deployed the Flip-O-Meter for a statement made on Twitter. It's truly a new era in political discourse — as long as the discourse can be contained in a 140-character tweet. One week after calling Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor a racist through a tweet to his Twitter followers, Newt Gingrich says he is retracting the comment. It all started on May 26 when President Barack Obama named Sotomayor his nominee for the nation's highest court. Conservatives quickly seized on her comment from a 2001 speech that she hoped that "a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life." The comment, they contended, showed Sotomayor would take race into account when making judicial decisions. Gingrich, a Republican who is a possible presidential candidate in 2012, joined the chorus of conservative critics the morning of May 27 with this tweet: "Imagine a judicial nominee said 'my experience as a white man makes me better than a latina woman' new racism is no better than old racism." (sic) Ten minutes later, he followed up with this: "White man racist nominee would be forced to withdraw. Latina woman racist should also withdraw." Other prominent Republicans echoed those sentiments. Rush Limbaugh called her a "reverse racist," and former Congressman Tom Tancredo said on MSNBC that "she appears to be a racist." Republican senators, meanwhile, were more measured. Sen. Jeff Sessions, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said that his committee "will engage in a fair and thorough examination of Ms. Sotomayor's previous judicial opinions, speeches, and academic writings to determine if she has demonstrated the characteristics that great judges share: integrity, impartiality, legal expertise, and a deep and unwavering respect for the rule of law." Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, went so far as to tell National Public Radio that Gingrich and Limbaugh's comments were "terrible" and that they were "not helpful under any circumstances." Now, a little more than a week later, Gingrich is changing his tune. "My initial reaction was strong and direct — perhaps too strong and too direct," Gingrich wrote June 3 on the conservative Web site Human Events. "The sentiment struck me as racist and I said so. Since then, some who want to have an open and honest consideration of Judge Sotomayor's fitness to serve on the nation's highest court have been critical of my word choice. With these critics who want to have an honest conversation, I agree. The word 'racist' should not have been applied to Judge Sotomayor as a person, even if her words themselves are unacceptable." Gingrich isn't backing down completely. "Sotomayor's words reveal a betrayal of a fundamental principle of the American system — that everyone is equal before the law," he wrote. Still, he's done a full 180 on his boldest criticism and the one that has been repeated countlessly by the media. He called her a racist and is now retracting that comment, which earns a Full Flop.

pomt-12929	Americans don't "care at all" about Donald Trump's tax returns.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/11/donald-trump/trump-wrong-reporters-are-only-ones-who-care-about/	In his first press conference since July 2016, President-elect Donald Trump scolded reporters for asking about his tax returns, saying members of the media are the only ones who care about the records. Trump said on Jan. 11, 2017, that he had no financial ties or business deals with Russia. He then dismissed the concerns of a reporter who asked Trump whether he would be releasing his tax returns to prove it. "I’m not releasing the tax returns because, as you know, they’re under audit," Trump said. The reporter pointed out that presidents have been releasing their returns since the 1970s. Trump interrupted her and said, "Oh, gee, I never heard that." "You know, the only one that cares about my tax returns are the reporters, okay? They’re the only ones," he said, saying he thought the American public isn’t concerned about it. "I won; I mean, I became president. No, I don’t think they care at all. I don’t think they care at all. I think you care." Media outlets have called for Trump to release his returns throughout his campaign, and have increased calls since his election. Trump and his surrogates have offered myriad excuses as to why he won’t release any information. But are they the only people who care whether he does it? Polling data consistently shows that overall, a majority of Americans want to know what’s in Trump’s tax records. The vocal majority It’s been common practice for decades for presidential candidates to release their tax returns. Despite Trump’s argument that he isn’t releasing his because he’s being audited, the IRS has said he’s allowed to release them whether he’s under an audit or not (as Richard Nixon did). Tax returns show a lot of details about a president’s business dealings and financial background, much more than, say, campaign finance disclosures, which Trump has offered as an alternative. That explains the media interest, which Trump has attacked before. Trump’s transition team did not elaborate on his statement when we contacted them, but he is wrong to say that the public doesn’t care, by most polls. One such poll taken before Trump's news conference confirms most Americans said he should release the returns. Pew Research Center released a new poll Jan. 10, on the eve of Trump’s latest press conference, that re-examined how voters felt. The poll showed that close to two-thirds of Americans think the issue is important. The poll was conducted Jan. 4-9 among 1,502 adults with a margin of error of 2.9 percentage points for the total sample. Sixty percent of the people polled by Pew said Trump has a responsibility to publicly release his tax returns. The numbers do vary broadly depending on political affiliation, however — 38 percent of Republicans or those leaning Republican agree he has a responsibility, compared to 79 percent of Democrats or those leaning to the left. There was a lot more polling about this topic before the Nov. 8 election. The way the questions were framed varies from poll to poll, so it's difficult to compare the figures directly. But generally they illustrate that Americans think Trump's tax returns are a serious issue. A Quinnipiac University poll released Aug. 25, 2016, showed that 74 percent of all voters said Trump should release his tax returns publicly. That figure dipped only slightly among Republicans, 62 percent of whom said he should release them. A Monmouth University poll the same week said that 62 percent of Americans thought it was either somewhat or very important to them that presidential candidates release their tax returns. A Fox News poll released Sept. 7 showed that 60 percent of voters, including 36 percent of Republicans and 83 percent of Democrats, thought Trump was hiding something in his tax returns. On Sept. 21, an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll showed that 52 percent of voters were concerned about Trump not releasing his tax returns. The choice was among several options about voters’ areas of concern about both Trump and Clinton. "Trump’s comments and language about women, immigrants and Muslims" was the top concern with 69 percent, and "Trump not having the right temperament to serve as commander in chief" was second with 66 percent. "Trump’s praise for Vladimir Putin" also ranked as a higher concern, at 59 percent. One outlier was when Fox News asked voters in a poll conducted Sept. 27-29 whether "the fact that Donald Trump hasn’t released his tax returns bother you, or is it no big deal?" Forty-six percent of respondents answered "bothers me," while 52 percent said it was "no big deal." But even that tally shows about half of Americans were concerned that Trump hadn't released his tax returns. Our ruling Trump said Americans don't "care at all" about his tax returns. Several polls, including one released the day before his latest press conference, show that a sizable portion of the public does think Trump’s tax returns are an important issue. These polls word their questions differently, but most results showed a majority of Americans believed the issue was relevant, undermining Trump’s assertion that only the media wants to explore the issue.

pomt-15377	Only five states, including Georgia, do not have a hate crimes law.	true	/georgia/statements/2015/jul/01/various-media-reports/south-carolina-georgia-3-other-states-dont-have-ha/	The U.S. Justice Department is weighing whether to bring a federal hate crimes charge in the June 17 church massacre in Charleston. The announcement has put the spotlight on the lack of a state-level law in South Carolina, as well as in a handful of other states. News media outlets, including Newsweek, and National Public Radio, have reported that South Carolina is one of only five states without a hate crimes law. PolitiFact Georgia decided to dig deeper into the claim. First, a little background. The FBI defines a hate crime as a traditional offense, such as murder, arson or vandalism, with the added element that the motivation is a bias based on race, religion, disability, ethnic origin or sexual orientation. Nearly 6,000 hate crimes were reported by law enforcement agencies in 2013, according to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program. In Charleston, authorities seemed fairly confident from the beginning that the mass shooting at historically black Emanuel A.M.E. Church was a hate crime. At a press conference on June 18, shellshocked city officials met with reporters to discuss the nine deaths and announce the arrest of suspect Dylann Roof, a 21-year-old high school dropout and sometimes construction worker who is white. "We believe this is a hate crime; that is how we are investigating it," Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen said. According to news reports, witnesses claim Roof told victims before shooting them, "You are raping our women and taking over our country." Roof also reportedly said after his arrest that he been out to start a "race war." On June 18, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced the Justice Department had opened a federal hate crimes investigation into the church shootings, which she termed a "barbaric crime." In media reports that followed, South Carolina, Arkansas, Wyoming, Indiana and Georgia -- were identified as five states out of 50 without hate crimes law. Steven M. Freeman, legal affairs director for the Anti-Defamation League, arguably the biggest advocacy group for these laws, said the list is accurate. But it’s clearly complicated. Newsweek first reported five states without hate crimes laws, then later revised its report to show only three states, Georgia, Arkansas and South Carolina. Michigan provided PolitiFact a copy of its hate crimes law, countering some reports that it belonged on the no-law list with Georgia. State hate crime laws can vary widely. Some are specific only to sexual orientation, while others address biases related to race and gender. Freeman said hate crime prosecution is best left to the states, since most crimes are investigated by state or local police. The federal hate crime law, he said, is meant as "a backstop." The federal hate crimes law has enhanced penalties for various crimes, as do most state laws of this nature. The filing of a federal hate crime charge in the Charleston church slayings could be viewed as largely symbolic since Roof is already charged with nine counts of murder, and South Carolina’s governor has called for the death penalty. Georgia unique Unlike South Carolina and the other three states, Georgia did have a hate crimes law. The Georgia General Assembly passed a hate crime bill in 2000 calling for enhanced prison sentences if a person or a person's property were victimized "because of bias or prejudice." The bill, sponsored by state Sen. Vincent Fort, D-Atlanta, was thrown out as "unconstitutionally vague" in 2004 by the Georgia Supreme Court. It did not specifically outlaw crimes committed based on specific biases, related to a victim’s race, religion, ethnicity, gender, disability or sexual orientation, as laws in other states did. Fort has tried since the 2004 ruling to pass another hate crimes bill, but has been unsuccessful. He said last week that he will try to build on the momentum of Charleston and push for passage of a new law next year. Charleston brings home the point he was trying to make in 1999 when he first introduced Georgia’s bill, that a hate crime is "terrorism and terrorism is different," Fort said. "It ultimately is designed to intimidate, not just one person, but an entire group," he said. "That is an important lesson out of Charleston. Hate crimes are terrorism."What this man did in that church is nothing less than terrorism." Like Fort, Charleston lawmakers have said they are renewing their efforts to establish a South Carolina hate crimes law. Jeannine Bell, a professor of law at Indiana University at Bloomington and a nationally recognized scholar on the topic of hate crimes, said state hate crime laws are effective, but not for the reason most people think. "They are not needed to address hate murders like what occurred in Charleston," Bell said. "Hate murders are relatively rare." The vast majority of hate crimes are low- level crimes that, but for hate crime legislation would not even be investigated by the police, let alone prosecuted, she said. The hate crime legislation provides a way to punish crimes that extremely traumatize the victim and community, Bell said. She said she believes there is a stigma attached to states without any form of hate crime legislation. "It may not be as significant as the stigma attached to those states that fly the Confederate battle flag," Bell said. "But my question, as a scholar in this area is: ‘Why wouldn’t a state enact legislation that addresses extreme acts of bias directed at its citizens?’ I cannot see any downsides to the legislation." Some civil libertarians see "slipper slope" But hate crime laws do raise concerns for some. Jonathan Turley, professor of law at George Washington University Law School, said the biggest concern is the threat to free speech as more speech is declared hate speech. He points to Europe and Canada as prime examples of prime examples of the dangers of expansive definitions of hate speech. "Unless carefully defined, these laws can place societies on a slippery slope of speech regulation," Turley said. "Since there are already laws criminalizing threats and related crimes, civil libertarians have always cautioned legislators about the implications and necessity of such laws." Our ruling Attorney General Loretta Lynch has opened an investigation to determine whether a federal hate crimes charge should be brought in the mass church shooting in Charleston. This is in the absence of a state hate crimes law in South Carolina. The tragedy has drawn attention South Carolina, Georgia and three others identified as the only ones without state-level hate crime laws.

pomt-07038	"In May we generated more jobs than all the rest of the country combined: 28,000 jobs in May for the state, 54,000 for the entire country."	half-true	/florida/statements/2011/jul/01/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-claims-florida-led-country-job-grow/	With nearly a million Floridians struggling without jobs in the wake of the Great Recession, Gov. Rick "Let's get to work!" Scott has the right message. And May's job numbers gave him a new talking point. On June 23, 2011, as news media gathered at the state Capitol for his signing of a tort reform bill, he repeated it: "In May we generated more jobs than all the rest of the country combined: 28,000 jobs in May for the state, 54,000 for the entire country." The unemployment rate in May dipped to 10.6 percent, a near two-year low after five straight months of improvement. Brag-worthy, right? But we were curious: Just how good was May for job creation in Florida? We checked with Scott's office and the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, which tracks employment across the country. According to a standard measure of employment in April and May, Scott nailed the numbers -- Florida gained 28,000 jobs. (Ohio was second, gaining 12,000 jobs.) That standard look comes from a monthly survey of businesses to ask how many jobs they have. (It's different from the survey that informs the unemployment rate, which is a survey of households.) The business survey helps economists estimate a total number of jobs — in a county, in a metro area, in a state, in the nation. Those numbers can be sliced and diced any number of ways, but Scott picked a useful, mainstream measure: "total nonfarm employment" that had been "seasonally adjusted." Farms are commonly excluded because that workforce swings so dramatically (you don't need many farm workers if there's no harvest this week). And it's helpful to look at estimates that have been "seasonally adjusted" because formulas make up for differences between months such as the number of weeks, holidays and seasonal employment patterns. Feeling pretty good about Scott's grasp of the situation, we chatted with a few economists. And that's where it got weird. It turns out that while seasonal adjustment is typically a useful tool to make meaningful comparisons over time — allowing you to compare jobs progress during, say, a long, holiday-heavy December with a short February — there are some pretty good reasons it wasn't so helpful in May. Seasonal adjustment formulas are constantly updated based on recent years, to take into account "normal" over-the-month change. David Denslow, a research economist at the University of Florida, pointed out that when you have enormous changes, as with the recent housing boom and bust (remember that?) and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, seasonal adjustment "becomes extraordinarily difficult." So, what did the unadjusted survey numbers show? According to estimates that weren't adjusted for the season, Florida didn't gain 28,000 new jobs from April to May — it actually lost 3,000 jobs. Across the country, the United States added 682,000 jobs when not adjusted for the season (compared to 54,000 jobs when adjusted). The differences here are critical to note. So we'll repeat ourselves. Depending on the two calculations: • Florida gained 28,000 new jobs ... or lost 3,000 jobs. • The country as a whole gained 54,000 new jobs ... or gained 682,000. A Bureau of Labor Statistics economist said the bureau attempted to minimize the affect "recent events" might have had on the seasonal adjustment calculation by putting more weight on earlier years than the more recent, irregular years. "In essence the irregular years do still have some influence on the seasonal adjustment factors for this year, however, by putting more weight on its history, the influence will be diminished," said Jonathan Hamburg, an economist who works with state and local statistics. Still, Denslow said, the significantly different stories the two stats tell raise some real questions. We're so used to seasonally adjusted numbers as the gold standard for comparing one month to another, we ran Denslow's concern by another economist who regularly chats with PolitiFact, Gary Burtless with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution. "One resolution of the problem," he said, "is simply to mention both sets of statistics to your readers and leave it for them to decide whether it is fair to say Florida 'generated more jobs than all the rest of the country combined' in a month when the best BLS estimate suggests the actual number of Florida jobs declined while the actual number of jobs in the nation as a whole increased." But he acknowledged we may all consider that a copout. So he pressed on to explain that with seasonal adjustment being the difference between job gains and losses, even a small error in the Bureau of Labor Statistics formula could make the governor’s claim "wildly off base." "It may be true, and perhaps revisions in the raw data or the seasonal adjustment factor may someday increase the probability that it is true," he said. "But based on the evidence at hand, I would say the governor has made a very silly claim." Where does this leave us? Scott accurately repeated an official statistic. But there's also a strong argument that the wild economic ride of recent years has made it challenging to accurately account for seasonal changes. Two economists we talked to say this undermines the credibility of Scott's claim — though we should note two others didn't mention the issue. But in light of a common federal statistic that shows the state may have actually lost jobs in May, the governor should have been more measured in his public trumpeting. We rate his statement Half True.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2011-07-01T19:10:54	2011-06-23	['None']
pomt-06370	"New Jersey alone, my home state, is facing a ten-and-a-half billion dollar shortfall in its 2012 fiscal budget. This means more cuts in state and local spending for education, which means our kids are hurt."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/nov/03/robert-menendez/robert-menendez-says-new-jersey-budget-shortfall-m/	After more than 20 years of public service on the local, state and federal levels, U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez should know you can’t adopt a state budget that doesn’t pay for itself. But that’s what Menendez, a Democrat, suggested during an Oct. 18 press conference about the Teachers and First Responders Back to Work Act, which he recently introduced. The legislation is aimed at creating or protecting jobs for teachers, police officers and firefighters. "New Jersey alone, my home state, is facing a ten-and-a-half billion dollar shortfall in its 2012 fiscal budget," Menendez said. "This means more cuts in state and local spending for education, which means our kids are hurt." PolitiFact New Jersey found that although New Jersey is not meeting all of its statutory obligations, the fiscal year 2012 budget adopted in June is, as required by state law, a balanced spending plan with no shortfall. As for education spending, the budget actually increases state aid for public schools over the previous fiscal year. Tricia Enright, a spokeswoman for Menendez, acknowledged the senator was wrong to suggest there is a current budget shortfall. "So, yes, he used the wrong tense in expressing the need to invest in educators for our kids," Enright wrote in an email. "But, the need is there and the facts – as our Senator, and most Americans see them -- are clear." But let’s explain the history behind the $10.5 billion cited by Menendez. In July 2010, the state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services estimated a "structural deficit" of nearly $10.5 billion for fiscal year 2012. That figure represented the difference between projected revenues from existing sources and the amount needed to pay for all spending required by state law and maintain current program levels. However, there’s a difference between what the state is legally obligated to spend and what is budgeted. The fiscal year 2012 budget does not entirely cover the spending level used to calculate the projected structural deficit, but the budget itself is balanced between its anticipated revenues and expenditures. In other words, there is no shortfall. It would be "unconstitutional" to adopt a budget with a built-in shortfall, and OLS is not projecting a shortfall to occur during fiscal year 2012, according to David Rosen, the budget and finance officer for the OLS. "A budget shortfall during a fiscal year is a different animal than a structural deficit looking forward to a budget," Rosen told us. "Those are two different concepts, really." Elizabeth McNichol, a senior fellow at the Washington, DC-based, Democratic-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said a state can have a structural deficit as well as a balanced budget. Once a budget is balanced, that year’s budget shortfall has been addressed, she said. McNichol added, "Every year, a state will end up balancing its budget, one way or another." It’s worth pointing out that Gov. Chris Christie has since rejected the use of the structural deficit, calling for a zero-based budgeting approach. In a Sept. 30 email, Andrew Pratt, a state Treasury Department spokesman, told us: "Except in theoretical terms, that means there are no longer any deficits to discuss." Now, let’s talk about education spending under the fiscal year 2012 budget. Menendez suggested that the budget means "more cuts in state and local spending for education." But as we’ve noted in previous rulings, the budget increases state aid for public schools by about $863 million over fiscal year 2011. The state is not funding public schools at the total level required by law, but funding is still up year-over-year, Rosen said. Our ruling Menendez claimed New Jersey "is facing a ten-and-a-half billion dollar shortfall in its 2012 fiscal budget," meaning more cuts in state spending on education. Although a nearly $10.5 billion structural deficit had been projected, the fiscal year 2012 budget is balanced, as required by state law. Also, the budget increases state aid for education over the previous fiscal year. Since Menendez is wrong about there being a budget shortfall and education funding cuts, we rate this statement False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-13660	Thanks to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, "Vietnam is drafting and presenting unprecedented labor reforms, changing their Constitution to recognize worker organizations in Vietnam for the first time."	half-true	/global-news/statements/2016/aug/04/barack-obama/barack-obama-jumps-gun-discussing-tpp-and-vietname/	At a press conference with Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Loong, President Barack Obama said the Trans-Pacific Partnership would improve global labor rights. Specifically, he said Vietnam had agreed to improve its labor policies as a condition of entering into the 12-country trade agreement, which has been contentious this election cycle. "Vietnam is drafting and presenting unprecedented labor reforms, changing their Constitution to recognize worker organizations in Vietnam for the first time," Obama said. We fact-checked another TPP claim from the press conference, on tariffs, elsewhere. Here, we look at Obama’s Vietnam claim. Labor law Before diving into what the TPP asks of Vietnam, let’s look at what protections Vietnam already affords workers. The 2013 Vietnamese Constitution provides for "break policies," "equal and safe" work conditions and protects against "discrimination, forced labor" and under-age workers. It also establishes trade unions to represent workers and protect their legal rights. According to a 2012 "Law on Trade Unions," however, this is an entity "placed under the leadership of the Communist Party of Vietnam." Essentially, all trade unions must affiliate with the Vietnam General Confederation of Labour. We consulted various law firms that cover Vietnamese labor law, and they detailed Vietnam’s already-existing labor protections. According to the the Southeast Asian law firm Tilleke & Gibbins, Vietnam sets a maximum of 48 hours per week and provides mandatory rest periods of at minimum 24 consecutive hours per week. Employers are required to provide protective equipment, and there is maternity leave typically around four months. The labor law firm Fisher Phillips classified Vietnam’s labor law as "employee-friendly." We spoke to White House representatives who acknowledged Vietnam had such provisions. So, what then, was Obama referring to as "unprecedented" labor reforms? Work-in-progress The White House pointed us to a "consistency plan" negotiated as part of the TPP, titled the "United States — Vietnam Plan for the Enhancement of Trade and Labour Relations." Key to the plan is the decoupling of labor unions from the government. Workers must be allowed to spontaneously form a grassroots labour union. The union must be registered, but not affiliated with, the government, thus allowing it to operate by its own rules and procedures. "Vietnam shall ensure that its law does not mandate a labour union registered with the competent government body to operate according to the Statutes of Vietnam General Confederation of Labour," the plan states. Experts we spoke to said the term "unprecedented" is valid. "The workers can form their own unions," said K. William Watson, a trade policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. "That's going to be a big change for Vietnam just because of the way it currently regulates labor unions. It’s not going to be compatible with the TPP at all." John Sifton, Asia Advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, said independent unions are the first step to having workers enforce their own rights. "This other stuff about minimum wage and working ours, all of that, is meaningless if you don’t have unions," he said. "Without unions, without the capacity to organize, whatever workers’ rights are written down on paper don’t have teeth." Changes to labor laws are still going through the country’s legislative process, they said. While acknowledging that might be the case, Sifton said Obama’s claim was "premature" for suggesting current changes. "They’ve signed up to a whole lot of things and if President Obama had simply said, ‘Vietnam has promised and must do a whole bunch of things under the TPP,’ then he would have been perfectly accurate," Sifton noted. "But he made it sound like Vietnam has already started to do things and that’s just not true." Enforcement Changing the law is one thing, but actually implementing it is another. Prior to the TPP entering into force, Vietnam must change its labor code to correspond with the side agreement, the White House explained. The plan also provides a review mechanism after-the-fact whereby the United States can impose higher tariffs on Vietnam if the provisions are not being implemented. Nonetheless, experts questioned both the likelihood of Vietnam implementing the new rules and of the United States enforcing them. Both Sifton and Watson noted America’s poor track record in enforcing other free trade agreements’ labor provisions. "They have a terrible record of enforcing labor chapters as evidenced by the Central American Free Trade Agreement and the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Colombian Free Trade Agreement," Sifton said. "So he says they’re enforceable and that’s true on paper and its true technically, but it doesn’t mean it would be be enforced." Watson, on the other hand, said it is in Vietnam’s economic interest — due to their significant gains from the TPP — to abide by the proposed legal changes. In order to attract investors, they have to follow the rules and won’t be too antagonistic to the agreement, he explained. "It’s not a situation where this was something that they didn’t want and now they’re going to try to sidestep it," he said. "Vietnam is — economically — the country that will benefit the most from the TPP." Vague language in the consistency plan could also hinder implementation, said Angie Ngoc Tran, a professor at California State University. In an article in New Mandala, she criticized the deal for not offering enough protection for independent unions and other procedural issues. On the flip side, Cathleen Cimino-Isaacs at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the TPP has made progress to address past failures. The Peterson Institute for International Economics has been described as a pro-trade economic policy group. "Although the TPP does not address all the concerns of labor rights advocates, it represents an important step forward," Cimino-Isaacs wrote. "The bilateral plans negotiated alongside the TPP are a major innovative component, targeted to address the substandard labor conditions of most concern. Implementation of the mandated reforms would deliver signiﬁcant improvements in Brunei, Malaysia, and Vietnam. The monitoring mechanisms attached to Vietnam’s plan in particular seem more proactive than past U.S. efforts." Our ruling Obama said "Vietnam is drafting and presenting unprecedented labor reforms" and is "changing their constitution to recognize worker organizations in Vietnam for the first time." There are some problems with the claim. Experts said actual changes to the law have not happened yet but acknowledged the drafting process might be underway. They did agree, however, that the changes proposed would qualify as "unprecedented." More critically, they said it’s hard to enforce the changes being described and the United States has a particularly poor track record of doing so. On balance, we rate this claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/0b4621f6-693f-412e-9d5f-d66f11d089be (Update Aug. 5: This fact-check was updated to include Cimino-Isaacs' comments.)

pomt-10341	Obama "voted for and even sponsored amendments that were intended to kill the (immigration overhaul) legislation."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/17/john-mccain/killing-the-bill-or-making-it-better/	Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama have similar views on how to fix the nation's immigration laws. But that isn't preventing them from exchanging blame for holding up progress on the issue. McCain used a July 14, 2008, appearance at the National Council of La Raza convention to tout his work on immigration reform and fire a broadside at his Democratic rival. He depicted Obama as an obstructionist who helped derail congressional efforts to enact an overhaul package last year. McCain alluded to the political risk he took last year as a Republican presidential candidate by joining forces with liberal icon Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and others in promoting a compromise Senate immigration package. Then, he portrayed Obama as a politician willing to put short-term political gains ahead of substantive policymaking. "I (helped draft the compromise bill) not just because I believed it was the right thing to do for Hispanic Americans. It was the right thing to do for all Americans," McCain said before the nation's largest Latino civil rights and advocacy organization. "Sen. Obama declined to cast some of those tough votes. He voted for and even sponsored amendments that were intended to kill the legislation, amendments that Sen. Kennedy and I voted against." Florida Republican Sen. Mel Martinez, a McCain supporter, made similar charges in a July 11 conference call with reporters, saying Obama offered an amendment that bill supporters regarded as a "poison pill" for the way it would have terminated a temporary worker program. McCain and Martinez were referring to a series of votes the Senate took in early June 2007 at a particularly sensitive time in the immigration debate. A months-long effort to pass an overhaul bill that would have combined border security and enforcement measures with a temporary worker program had become caught in a stalemate between Democratic and Republican leaders over how much time to spend trying to amend the measure. The tension was exacerbated by a Memorial Day deadline that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., set for holding a final vote. Reid ultimately extended the debate into June, giving in to GOP demands. A key point of contention was a temporary worker program and a plan to allow millions of illegal immigrants to remain in the United States, work in the country and ultimately earn citizenship. President Bush campaigned in 2000 on the issue and had reached out to Democrats after they gained control of Congress. Some conservative Republicans criticized the so-called "path to citizenship" provisions, believing the best remedy was for Bush and Congress to address years of failed promises made by the federal government for stepped-up border enforcement. With the GOP divided, Democrats had little desire to boost the fortunes of a weakened president. And Democrats themselves were under pressure from their allies in organized labor, which opposed guest worker provisions. The result was that the Senate took up a politically fragile compromise package whose fate could have been threatened by any number of amendments. On June 6, Obama took aim at one component of the citizenship provisions, proposing to terminate after five years a new merit-based system for awarding green cards that confer permanent resident status. The merit-based system would have apportioned green cards based on the nation's economic needs and moved away from the existing system, which rewards family ties. A coalition of 40 immigrant rights groups, including La Raza, endorsed Obama's measure, saying the new system would discriminate in favor of immigrants with higher educations and training in specialty occupations. However, the Senate rejected Obama's amendment, 42-55. Hours later, Sen. Byron L. Dorgan, D-N.D., successfully offered an amendment to terminate the temporary worker program after five years. Dorgan contended the program would have the effect of bringing cheap labor in through the back door and squeezing out American workers. In spite of pleas from Kennedy, who said Congress should give the program a chance to work, the Senate adopted the amendment in a 49-48 vote, with Obama siding with Dorgan. Republicans like McCain who helped write the compromise immigration overhaul regarded the guest work provisions as essential and branded Dorgan's effort a "deal-breaker." But as they tried to undo the damage, Reid took steps to pull the bill from consideration and end the debate. The legislation collapsed amid three failed votes to cut off debate on June 7. Immigration experts say Obama was one of a host of senators who tried to influence the package, but was not a pivotal participant in the debate. "McCain drove comprehensive immigration reform legislation and bucked his party knowing full well what the consequences would be. Obama was a player, but he was nothing like the central player McCain was in either 2006 or 2007," said Tamar Jacoby, president and chief executive officer of ImmigrationWorks USA, a Washington-based advocacy group advancing immigration reform. Angela Kelley, director of the Immigration Policy Center in Washington, said Obama's amendment put Senate Democrats in a particularly tough bind, because it would have scrapped a Bush administration points-based system of awarding green cards based on family ties. Yet adopting it would have greatly complicated prospects for the plan co-authored by Kennedy, one of the party's icons. "There's no black or white answer on it," Kelley said. "If you want to say Obama was offering that kind of an amendment (poison pill), the Republicans would say, sure, because they had a lot of control in what got to the heart of the bill. If you also want to say Obama wanted a sober debate about what made sense for the immigration bill, he did that, too. It was like an optical illusion, the same picture seen two ways." Kelley said Dorgan's amendment was bitterly opposed by business interests and went to the heart of the bipartisan plan. "They described the Dorgan amendment as a poison pill at that time," she said. It's a fact that Obama's actions came at a critical point in the immigration debate and threatened a fragile political compromise. And he supported Dorgan's amendment, which was considered the poison pill McCain describes. But it's not accurate to describe Obama's amendment in the same terms. It addressed what many experts viewed as a central component of any viable immigration reform package. McCain and his camp are exaggerating Obama's role by portraying him as a giant-slayer without offering any proof Obama was intent on killing the entire package. For these reasons, we deem McCain's claim Half True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-07-17T00:00:00	2008-07-14	['None']
pomt-00620	Says Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has stated that supporting the "right to health care ... means you believe in slavery."	true	/punditfact/statements/2015/may/27/sarah-silverman/did-rand-paul-equate-right-health-care-slavery/	Comedian Sarah Silverman’s liberal leanings are almost as well-known as her raunchy style. Her 2008 pro-Barack Obama video "The Great Schlep" attracted 2.2 million views on YouTube; a follow-up from 2012 attracted another 1.1 million views. Recently, a reader forwarded us this shareable meme from Silverman’s feed at WhoSay, a social media site, that’s critical of presidential candidate and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. The meme -- which Silverman had passed along from the Twitter account of actor Michael Sheen -- shows Paul seated at a congressional hearing. The meme purports to quote Paul equating the right to health care with slavery. What do the facts say? We were able to track down the source of the comments. They stem from a Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions subcommittee hearing on May 11, 2011. Paul’s unusual comparison attracted a flurry of media attention at the time, as well as sniping by Paul’s critics. The meme shortened Paul’s comments to fit the available space, but the abridgement doesn’t strike us as twisting the gist of his comments. Here’s the full excerpt: "With regard to the idea of whether you have a right to health care, you have to realize what that implies. It’s not an abstraction. I’m a physician. That means you have a right to come to my house and conscript me. It means you believe in slavery. It means that you’re going to enslave not only me, but the janitor at my hospital, the person who cleans my office, the assistants who work in my office, the nurses. "Basically, once you imply a belief in a right to someone’s services, do you have a right to plumbing? Do you have a right to water? Do you have right to food? You’re basically saying you believe in slavery. You’re saying you believe in taking and extracting from another person. Our founding documents were very clear about this. You have a right to pursue happiness but there’s no guarantee of physical comfort. There’s no guarantee of concrete items. In order to give something concrete, you have to take it from someone. So there’s an implied threat of force. "If I’m a physician in your community and you say you have a right to health care, do you have a right to beat down my door with the police, escort me away and force me to take care of you? That’s ultimately what the right to free health care would be. If you believe in a right to health care, you’re believing in basically the use of force to conscript someone to do your bidding." A few days after the speech, the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, a free-market group, posted a longer version of Paul’s speech on YouTube, suggesting that the next 30 seconds or so provided more nuance to Paul’s comments and had been overlooked by commentators. Here is the additional comment: "Now just because it's a noble thing to believe that we are obligated as Christians, we are obligated to the Hippocratic Oath, we have always done this. Since the beginning of modern medicine we have always provided 100 percent access. I do it in exchange for privileges. I do it because I believe in the Hippocratic Oath. But my hospital also says to me you can only operate in this hospital if you agree to see everyone coming through the emergency room. I always have. People have always had 100 percent access to our emergency room. Those are for emergencies -- those are not the best place for primary care." We don’t think Paul’s subsequent comments greatly change what he said earlier, since he’s saying he’s consenting to the servitude of treating non-paying patients as a condition of being allowed to practice at certain hospitals. In this comment, he still sees it as a burden to be borne. In addition, Paul says he’s referring to emergency-room care, not to primary care. Primary care was the point of getting uninsured Americans covered under the Affordable Care Act, so they wouldn’t have to resort to going to emergency rooms for basic services. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. -- who, as it happens, is also running for president in 2016 -- used his perch as the chairman of the subcommittee to ask a witness, physician Dana Kraus, whether she felt like a "slave" working at her federally qualified health center. "I love my job," she responded. "I do not feel like a slave." Even Matt Welch, the editor of the libertarian magazine Reason, had harsh words for Paul, who has long been identified with the libertarian movement. "Could slaves free themselves by changing professions?" Welch wrote. "Do doctors in Switzerland get taken away at gunpoint? To treat the analogy with technical seriousness, even setting aside (as if you could) the colossal weight of America's most lasting shame, is to render it ridiculous, in my opinion." We could not find an instance of Paul addressing these comments further, and Paul’s staff didn’t respond to a pair of inquiries. Our ruling Silverman forwarded a social media meme that said Paul has stated that supporting the "right to health care … means you believe in slavery." The meme has been abridged from the full quote, but we see no significant change in his meaning. We also found no evidence that Paul had backtracked on the views he expressed. We rate the meme’s claim True.	None	Sarah Silverman	None	None	None	2015-05-27T15:02:01	2015-05-22	['None']
pomt-09645	A recent drop in the unemployment rate is questionable because it was calculated "over two days of the Thanksgiving week."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/dec/10/rush-limbaugh/limbaugh-says-unemployment-drop-was-skewed-thanksg/	On his Dec. 8, 2009, radio show, conservative host Rush Limbaugh mocked President Barack Obama's claim that the job market is stabilizing. Limbaugh played a tape of Obama giving a speech on the economy and jobs earlier that morning at the Brookings Institution in Washington. "Finally," Obama said, "we're no longer seeing the severe deterioration in the job market that we once were. In fact, we learned on Friday (Dec. 4) that the unemployment rate fell slightly last month." Then Limbaugh interrupts. "Stop the tape. That's because the figures were taken over two days of the Thanksgiving week where people were not working, were not looking for work, were not filing claims and so this -- wait 'til that number is revised. Wait 'til the number ends up being revised. It's going to go up." To determine whether the timing of a holiday could disrupt a long-standing federal statistic, we'll start by looking at the figures Obama was referring to. The numbers released Dec. 4 were the ones that most people think of whenever they think of unemployment statistics -- namely, the "unemployment rate" as calculated by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics using the Current Population Survey. Using in-person and phone interviews, Labor Department officials track a sampling of households to determine each member's status in the work force, then use that raw data to help calculate the unemployment rate. On Dec. 4, officials announced that unemployment in November had edged downward, to 10.0 from 10.2 percent in October. That is the slight fall that the president referenced in his speech. But experts say this data couldn't have been skewed by Thanksgiving week, for two reasons. First, the Current Population Survey interviews always refer to someone's employment status during week that includes the 12th of the month. This November, that was the week of Monday, Nov. 9, to Friday, Nov. 13 -- two weeks before Thanksgiving. Second, the data from the Current Population Survey is "seasonally adjusted." That means that before the numbers are released, officials adjust them to smooth out any fluctuations caused by the calendar. Even though the term "seasonally adjusted" makes it sound as if officials only adjust the numbers to reflect variations tied to winter, spring, summer and fall, the adjustments also take into account factors that could make a particular week an oddity. The Labor Department and economists say that the seasonal adjustments are based on well-established trends and would take into account any quirks from the presence of a holiday during the data-collection week. So Limbaugh is incorrect that the unemployment rate cited by Obama could have been skewed by what was happening during Thanksgiving week. That said, Limbaugh's assertion isn't entirely out of left (or right) field. There's another unemployment statistic that typically gets some coverage in the media, though less than the unemployment rate: the number of initial jobless claims. This statistic is compiled by a different part of the Labor Department -- the Employment and Training Administration -- and reflects all available data on residents who are applying for unemployment insurance for the first time. And this year, just a day before the unemployment rate was announced, an initial jobless claims number was released ... using statistics collected during Thanksgiving week (although not just on two days of that week, as Limbaugh said). As it happened, those numbers fell slightly as well. Some economists say that having a holiday fall during the data collection week is at least a potential problem for statistical reliability. Adolfo Laurenti, deputy chief economist and managing director of Mesirow Financial Holdings Inc., said that the survey's reliance on 50 different state agencies for data makes it somewhat more susceptible to anomalies, such as the timing of a holiday. But the numbers for the initial jobless claims, like the Current Population Survey figures, are seasonally adjusted, based on the Labor Department's years of experience with recurring patterns. So the fact that Thanksgiving fell during this week should not make a difference with this data, either. One final note: On Dec. 10, 2009, the initial jobless claims numbers for the week ending Dec. 5 were released, and they were higher than they were the previous week. Limbaugh can perhaps take a measure of vindication, but it should not obscure the fact that his claim of holiday bias is incorrect. Skepticism about the seasonal adjustment methodology could lead someone to believe that the initial jobless claim numbers were skewed by the holiday week. But it would be a stretch for Limbaugh to argue that he was referring to initial jobless claims rather than the unemployment rate. Not only is the unemployment rate the most commonly cited unemployment statistic, but Obama, in the taped lead-in, clearly refers to the "unemployment rate." Since this statistic uses data about what was happening two weeks before Thanksgiving -- and since both measures are seasonally adjusted to eliminate factors such as holidays -- we rate Limbaugh's statement False.

pomt-00195	Says Scott Walker supports "a health care plan that would gut protections for pre-existing conditions."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/oct/18/tony-evers/scott-walker-says-he-would-cover-pre-existing-cond/	Like Democrat Tammy Baldwin against Republican Leah Vukmir in the Wisconsin U.S. Senate race, Tony Evers has been hitting Scott Walker on pre-existing conditions in the governor’s race. Baldwin, the incumbent senator, claimed Vukmir supports letting insurance companies "deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions." Our rating was Half True. Join us for a free PolitiFact event in Milwaukee. Meanwhile, Evers, the Democratic nominee for governor, has made similar attacks on Walker, the two-term incumbent, ahead of the Nov. 6, 2018 election. One attack comes in a video posted Oct. 10, 2018 in which Evers claims Walker supports "a health care plan that would gut protections for pre-existing conditions." Let’s see what plan Evers is referring to. All our Tammy Baldwin and Leah Vukmir fact checks in the U.S. Senate race. Repealing Obamacare As we noted in the Baldwin fact check, at issue here is the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and its prohibition on insurers denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. Under the federal law, if you don’t have health insurance from an employer or the government, you have guaranteed access to insurance in the individual market, regardless of your health, and you can’t be charged higher rates for a pre-existing condition. That blanket protection is something that is threatened by Republican efforts to repeal the law, and Walker supports repeal. For example, he backed the so-called Graham-Cassidy repeal bill, saying: "I think it’s awesome… It’s a winner all the way around." News reports said that under the bill, states could have allowed for waivers to let insurers charge sick patients higher premiums and stop covering certain benefits required under the Affordable Care Act; and that states could obtain waivers to permit insurers to charge different premiums based on health status, age or other factors. PolitiFact National, noting that Democrats across the country are attacking Republicans over pre-existing conditions, has reported that Republican proposals are not as air tight as Obamacare when it comes to pre-existing conditions. Graham-Cassidy would have allowed insurers to sell bare-bones plans with low premiums that would be attractive to healthy people, while plans that provide the coverage that sicker people need would be very expensive, our colleagues reported. All our Tony Evers and Scott Walker fact checks in the governor’s race. So, repeal of Obamacare — and its protections for pre-existing conditions -- is one plan Walker supports. But there’s another. Walker also backed a lawsuit brought by Wisconsin and 19 other states that a New York Times news story said could eviscerate major parts of the Affordable Care Act and allow insurers to again deny people coverage because of their medical condition or history. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. So, Walker supports two plans, or initiatives, that would result in eliminating blanket protections for people with pre-existing conditions. To be clear, Walker hasn’t said people with pre-existing conditions shouldn’t be covered. But he hasn’t spelled out an alternative that would provide protections that Obamacare does. Walker’s response Walker has repeatedly promised to cover people with pre-existing conditions and has pledged to pass legislation to guarantee them coverage. For example, he called for such a law in his January 2018 state of the state speech. And in September 2018, he said he would call a special session of the Legislature to adopt that measure if the Affordable Care Act were blocked. The prospects for such a bill passing, however, are unclear. Moreover, Walker has provided few details on what he has in mind, raising questions about how people with pre-existing conditions would be covered. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel examined what would happen to people in Wisconsin with pre-existing conditions if Obamacare were overturned. In short, the fates of some them are uncertain. The Affordable Care Act requires insurers to cover specific health benefits, including prescription drugs for almost every medical condition. So, without a similar requirement in state law, insurers could sidestep any requirement that they cover pre-existing health conditions. They could do this by not including some services or costly drugs in a health plan's benefits. It’s also worth noting that before Obamacare, Wisconsin’s high-risk pool was held up as something as a model on pre-existing conditions, at least for the people it covered. But it worked only for people who could afford the insurance in the first place — and many people with pre-existing conditions could not afford coverage from the high-risk pool, as it covered fewer than 25,000 people. An estimated 852,000 people in Wisconsin have a health condition that would have led to being denied coverage in the market for health insurance sold directly to individuals and families before the Affordable Care Act. Our rating Evers says Walker supports "a health care plan that would gut protections for pre-existing conditions." Walker has supported two efforts that would result in elimination of blanket protections for pre-existing conditions: Legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act and a lawsuit that would block it. The law provides a variety of protections to people with pre-existing medical conditions — including prohibiting insurers from denying coverage to those people and prohibiting them from charging those people higher rates. So, getting rid of Obamacare would eliminate those protections. Walker has pledged that if Obamacare is repealed, he would seek legislation to guarantee coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. But it’s not clear how that legislation would compare to Obamacare and not clear if it could pass the Legislature. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.

pomt-11600	"We enacted the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/30/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-again-recent-tax-bill-biggest-e/	President Donald Trump repeated in his State of the Union address one of his most frequent talking points — and one that has been repeatedly debunked. "We enacted the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history," Trump said in his address. Measuring the size of the tax cut is a straightforward task. And as we noted the last time we fact-checked a similar claim, the tax bill passed last December doesn’t stack up as the largest cut ever. On the eve of its passage, the Joint Committee on Taxation — Congress’s nonpartisan arbiter of tax analysis — said the tax bill would cost about $1.5 trillion over 10 years, or about $150 billion a year. How does that compare historically? The Treasury Department has published a list of the biggest tax bills between 1940 and 2012, measured not only by contemporary dollars but also by inflation-adjusted dollars and as a percentage of gross domestic product (a measure of the size of the overall economy). Depending on what projection of the current bill you use and what yardstick you measure it by, several bills since 1980 were larger. Here’s the list by inflation-adjusted dollars: Tax bill Inflation-adjusted dollars (per year) American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (enacted in 2013) $321 billion Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 $210 billion Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 $208 billion Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 $150 billion By this measurement, the recent tax bill ranks as the fourth-biggest since 1940. The Trump-signed legislation falls lower on the list when the cuts are ordered from highest to lowest as a percentage of GDP: Tax bill Percentage of GDP Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 2.89 percent Revenue Act of 1945 2.67 percent Revenue Act of 1948 1.87 percent American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (enacted in 2013) 1.78 percent Revenue Act of 1964 1.6 percent Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 1.31 percent Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 0.9 percent By this measurement, the recent tax bill ranked seventh. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has noted that an even earlier tax cut from 1921, not included in the Treasury Department analysis, accounted for 1.1 percent of GDP. The group added in a blog post that "if President Trump wanted to pass a tax cut that exceeds the record 2.9 percent of the economy in 1981, it would cost roughly $6.8 trillion over ten years." Our ruling Trump said, "we enacted the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history." In inflation-adjusted dollars, the recent tax bill is the fourth-largest since 1940. And as a percentage of GDP, it ranks seventh. We rate the statement False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2018-01-30T21:24:30	2018-01-30	['United_States']
pomt-01808	"Right now, one third of all illegal aliens are going to California."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/23/pat-buchanan/pat-buchanan-right-now-one-third-all-illegal-alien/	The Golden State went from red to blue thanks to an influx of immigrants, which is a cautionary tale for the national conservative agenda, says GOP pundit Pat Buchanan. On July 17, 2014, on Fox’s The Sean Hannity Show, Buchanan noted that California Republicans are now outnumbered 2 to 1 in the state Legislature, 2 to 1 one in Congress, and that no Republican holds a statewide office. "Right now, one third of all the illegal aliens go to California. Take a look at California politically, which Richard Nixon carried five times and Ronald Reagan carried in four landslides," he said. "And when the country looks like California demographically, it’s gonna look like California politically." We wanted to check Buchanan’s claim that a third of the country’s unauthorized immigrants are Cali-bound. To the redwood forests Buchanan did not respond when we asked where he got his numbers, so we can’t know for sure. There’s really no good data on immediate destinations -- where unauthorized immigrants are going initially -- according to Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer at the Pew Research Center. He said that though immigrants are more mobile than native-born residents, the general trend is that fewer immigrants are going to California first. There’s also no way to know exactly how many unauthorized immigrants reside in the United States, wrote Kevin Johnson, the dean of public interest law at the University of California-Davis. Most reports and experts agree that the number is somewhere between 11 and 12 million. So based on the estimates we have, where are unauthorized immigrants living? In 2012, the Department of Homeland Security reported that 25 percent of unauthorized immigrants live in California. Texas came in second with 16 percent. The estimates rely on U.S. Census Bureau data, which attempts to measure everyone living in the country, measured against data on legal immigrants from the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State. The Department of Homeland Security warns in its report that its state-to-state estimates may be affected by state-to-state migration (i.e. someone lives in California at the time of the Census but moved elsewhere later). Another report, from Pew, has a slightly lower estimate. In 2013, Pew reported that 21 percent of the nation’s unauthorized immigrants lived in California, a rate that Pew says has held steady since 2010. That’s a sharp decline from 1990, when Pew said that 42 percent of all unauthorized immigrants lived in California. Texas came in second in this report as well, at 14.5 percent. Both these reports, we should note, measure where unauthorized immigrants are living. Buchanan said they are "going" there after crossing the border. "Maybe, I’m speculating here, (Buchanan’s number) can refer to the immigrants first going into California and then moving to other states? I haven’t seen any reports that suggest that though. So most likely, he’s speaking out of his butt," said Manuel Pastor, co-director of the University of Southern California’s Center for the Study of Immigration Integration. While California is taking in more unauthorized immigrants than other states, its share has been dropping, experts say. Passel said this is because of the state’s recession in the mid 1990s, which led to immigrants seeking jobs in "new destination areas" such as Texas. Historically, because immigrants are attracted to the United States for employment opportunities, the Golden State has always been a top choice, especially for unauthorized immigrants seeking niche labor opportunities. "California has a large economy with many jobs, including the agricultural, construction, and service industries, which have attracted undocumented workers," Johnson said. In addition to geographic proximity, the rise of the service sector and low-wage manufacturing in the 1980s and 1990s made Los Angeles a mecca for immigrants, Pastor said. And since most immigration is "chain immigration," immigrants tend to head for California. "Their families are already there. Their friends are there," Pastor said. "Many undocumented immigrants have been in America longer than 10 years. There’s a tendency to think this is a shallowly rooted population. But these immigrants are deeply immersed in their communities." Party lines Though not specifically part of this fact-check, it’s important to note that Buchanan is mixing apples and oranges when he suggests unauthorized immigrants are directly affecting election outcomes. Unauthorized immigrants cannot vote. Neither can legal immigrants until they are naturalized. And there are almost no reports in California of unlawful voting by noncitizens, according to Johnson. "California’s racial ethnic makeup has certainly changed. But still, a lot of its legal immigrants aren’t citizens, let alone unauthorized immigrants," said Passel. The one situation that most directly could affect an election would be if two unauthorized parents have a child in the United States. That child would be a legal U.S. citizen and would be eligible to vote when they turn 18. On politics, it’s hard to see a direct correlation simply between the number of unauthorized immigrants and election results. California voted Republican for president from 1968-88 and has voted Democrat from 1992-2012. Of the state’s last six elected governors, three were Republican and three were Democrat. In Texas, which has the second-highest share of unauthorized immigrants, Republicans have won the last nine presidential elections and served as governor for 27 out of the past 35 years. The ruling Buchanan said, "Right now, one third of all illegal aliens are going to California." While experts say no good account for initial destinations of unauthorized immigrants exists, the most reliable estimates of unauthorized immigrants living in California range between 21 and 25 percent. That’s a bit lower than what Buchanan said. As a result, we rate his claim Half True.	None	Pat Buchanan	None	None	None	2014-07-23T11:30:15	2014-07-17	['California']
pomt-14121	Twenty million Americans are "out of work."	half-true	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/may/09/tom-marino/pa-congressman-tom-marino-says-20-million-american/	U.S. Rep. Tom Marino took to MSNBC to defend presumptive GOP Presidential nominee Donald Trump, and cited an eye-opening number of unemployed Americans in the process. Marino, a Republican who represents Pennsylvania’s 10th district, endorsed Trump in February, saying the decision was "one of my life-changing moments," according to Politico. He appeared Thursday on MSNBC to defend the real estate mogul’s record and assert Trump, who’s never held elected office before, is the best person for the job. "To those that are saying that this just isn’t going to work, let me ask you this question: How’s it been working the last 30 years with governors and senators and career politicians being president?" he asked. "We’re 20 trillion dollars in debt, 20 million people out of work, businesses leaving the country, people are afraid that they can’t even send their kids to college." The idea that 20 million people are out of work in America sounded high, especially because the official number of unemployed Americans was 8 million as of April 1, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. So we decided to check the fact. Marino’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment from PolitiFact, but we’ve looked into this claim before. Former presidential candidate John Kasich actually cited the 20 million figure in a campaign ad in February, and when PolitiFact asked the Kasich campaign for evidence, they proceeded to cite a source that caught us off-guard: Us. Specifically, they pointed to an even earlier fact check from August in which we analyzed a statement by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Trump said that "we have 93 million people out of work. They look for jobs, they give up, and all of a sudden, statistically, they're considered employed." We rated this claim False, largely because the 93 million number included lots of people who would not be expected to want or be able to work, including full-time students, senior citizens, the disabled, and those who have chosen to take care of their children full-time. However, in the process, we conducted a mathematical experiment in which we played with possible numbers of Americans who are "out of work" that fit somewhere between the official unemployment rate (on the low end) and Trump’s number (on the high end). Here’s what we wrote, using the statistics that were current at the time: The official number of unemployed Americans is 8.3 million -- less than one-tenth of what Trump says. But to give Trump the benefit of the doubt, it’s possible to expand this number using more credible economic thinking. Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, says it’s not unreasonable to include: The 6.4 million people who haven’t looked for work recently enough to qualify as being "in the labor force," but who say they "currently want a job." And the 6.5 million people working part-time who would prefer to have a full-time job. This would mean that upwards of 21 million Americans could be described with some justification as "out of work" involuntarily, either fully or partially. But that’s not even one-quarter of the number that Trump offered. Rob Nichols, a spokesman for Kasich, said the campaign simply updated our math with more recent data in preparing the television ad. The numbers for January 2016, Nichols said, were: Unemployed: 7.8 million People who haven’t looked for work recently enough to qualify as being "in the labor force," but who say they "currently want a job": 6.2 million People working part-time who would prefer to have a full-time job: 6 million. That works out to 20 million on the nose. We salute the Kasich campaign’s efforts to fact-check-proof their assertion. Still, we should note that we didn’t intend our calculation to be the final word on how to determine the number of "out of work" Americans. Rather, we were trying to provide a benchmark for showing just how wrong Trump’s number was. We’ll note that our wording was that the 21 million figure had "some justification" — not exactly a clarion call for the Bureau of Labor Statistics to change its longstanding protocol. In subsequent fact-checks, though not the one the Kasich campaign referred to, we have added language that is clearer about our intentions. We did that, for instance, in our Feb. 11, 2016, fact-check of a different statement by Trump: "Don't believe those phony numbers when you hear 4.9 and 5 percent unemployment. The number's probably 28, 29, as high as 35 (percent). In fact, I even heard recently 42 percent." In that fact-check, which produced a rating of Pants on Fire, we prefaced a similar alternative calculation this way: "We are deliberately stretching the numbers here as an intellectual exercise; we are not saying that 15.6 percent is a more accurate unemployment rate than the official one of 4.9 percent." But enough from us. What do the two economists we checked with for the original fact-check think about the use of the 20 million figure? "Given that the image looks like a guy in an unemployment line, I'd say it's a misleading figure," said Tara Sinclair, an economist with George Washington University and the jobs website Indeed.com. Many people have good reasons for not wanting to work now, she said, and that is something distinct from actually being "out of work." Burtless agreed, saying, "The 5.988 million people working part-time who would prefer to have a full-time job are not ‘out of work.’ They are employed, but on a work schedule that does not provide them with the weekly hours they desire." At the same time, Burtless said there is still some value in the number cited in Kasich’s advertisement. He called a the 20 million figure "an upper-bound estimate of the total number of Americans who are unemployed or underemployed." It’s just not the only estimate. Our ruling Marino said on MSNBC that 20 million Americans are out of work. While the statement can be interpreted as accurate depending on the definition of "out of work," it lacks context.

pomt-13271	Says Colorado congressional candidate Morgan Carroll "voted to allow welfare recipients to use your tax dollars at ATMs at strip clubs and pot dispensaries."	mostly true	/colorado/statements/2016/oct/13/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-morgan-carroll-voted-let-welfare-recipients-u/	A Republican group has launched a racy ad saying Colorado state Sen. Morgan Carroll, a Democratic congressional candidate, voted to allow welfare recipients to use public benefit cards at ATMs in strip clubs and marijuana dispensaries. The National Republican Congressional Committee’s ad shows how down and dirty the race between Carroll and Republican incumbent Rep. Mike Coffman is getting in the final sprint to Election Day. They’re fighting over suburban Denver’s 6th Congressional District, one of the nation’s most competitive swing districts. "Career politicians waste lots of money. Morgan Carroll is one of the worst," the narrator says at the beginning of the ad, titled "Clubs." "Carroll voted to allow welfare recipients to use your tax dollars at ATMs at strip clubs and pot dispensaries," the narrator continues as the video shifts from Carroll addressing the Legislature to her standing at a podium in front of a red neon silhouette of a nude female figure and the words "STRIPPERS" and "MORGAN CARROLL" on a brick wall. There's a row of marijuana-filled jars beside the senator. "It's enough to make you ask, 'What's Morgan Carroll thinking?' Welfare for lap dances? Morgan Carroll is careless with our money," the ad concludes. We examined the claim that "Carroll voted to allow welfare recipients to use your tax dollars at ATMs at strip clubs and pot dispensaries." The facts are fairly straightforward. Carroll was among a dozen Democratic senators who voted against final passage of a 2015 bill to prohibit welfare recipients from using state-issued electronic benefit transfer (or EBT) cards to obtain cash from ATMs at pot shops and strip clubs. Low-income families use these debit cards to buy "essential goods" such as food and clothing and to help pay for utilities and rent. Senate Bill 65, which became law, expanded on existing state law prohibiting people from using the cards to withdraw ATM cash at liquor stores, casinos and gun shops. Federal law already required states to prevent people receiving public benefits from using EBT cards at liquor stores, gambling and adult entertainment venues. Colorado also has had trouble preventing people from withdrawing ATM cash totalling hundreds of thousands of dollars at casinos and liquor stores, according to Watchdog.org. State officials and lawmakers warned that Colorado would face financial sanctions for failing to comply with federal prohibitions against EBT card use at strip clubs. There were also concerns about a federal crackdown after several reports of people using the benefit cards at shops selling medical or recreational marijuana -- a drug that’s legal under state law but illegal under federal law. "We stand to lose a lot if we don't show we are trying" to prevent the use of tax money for marijuana, Republican Sen. Vicki Marble, a primary sponsor of the bill, told the Associated Press last year. "The growers here put in a lot of time and effort. A raid would be absolutely devastating to our state." Why did Carroll -- along with many other Democratic senators -- vote against the bill? "The reason she voted against it was because of 'banking deserts,' where many poor people don't have" bank ATMs in their neighborhoods, said Carroll campaign spokesman Drew Godinich. Removing their ability to get cash from ATMs at the many marijuana dispensaries that dot Colorado cities and towns hampers low-income families’ ability to access money to purchase legitimate products elsewhere, he added. According to the Atlantic magazine, a March study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on the increase of "banking deserts" found that "lower-income communities and communities of color have historically and disproportionately limited access to mainstream banking services." This makes it harder for people in these communities to manage their finances and build wealth, the study said. Democratic lawmakers had repeatedly defeated similar legislation, arguing that improper ATM withdrawals at strip clubs, liquor stores, casinos represent a tiny fraction of the total use of cash-assistance cards, the Denver Post reported. Critics also note that the 2015 law doesn't prevent someone on welfare from using their EBT card to make a withdrawal at a supermarket ATM and then go spend the cash at a pot shop or a strip club. Our ruling NRCC says, "Carroll voted to allow welfare recipients to use your tax dollars at ATMs at strip clubs and pot dispensaries." There's slightly more to this than the NRCC lets on: Carroll voted, unsuccessfully, to allow welfare recipients to continue withdrawing money from ATMs at strip clubs and pot dispensaries. Carroll’s spokesman said the senator voted against the bill that prohibited people from using public benefit cards for cash withdrawals at strip clubs and marijuana dispensaries because she was concerned about the impact on residents of poor neighborhoods where there are few -- if any -- banking services. State officials and lawmakers warned that Colorado could face financial sanctions for failing to comply with federal prohibitions against the use of benefit cards at adult entertainment venues.

pomt-05925	A proposed mine in Wisconsin is "about two-thirds the size of Lake Winnebago."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jan/30/penny-bernard-schaber/wisconsin-democrat-says-proposed-mine-would-be-nea/	Would a proposed iron ore mine in Wisconsin be nearly the size of one of the nation’s largest inland lakes? About an hour into an 11-hour legislative hearing on Jan. 11, 2012, state Rep. Penny Bernard Schaber, D-Appleton, worried aloud about environmental damage such an operation might cause. The second-term Assembly member compared the mine to Lake Winnebago, the largest of Wisconsin’s 15,000 inland lakes and one of the largest freshwater inland lakes in the U.S. "That's a very large lake that's right at the end of the area that I represent, extremely large lake. And from what I've tried to figure out on the central size of this mine, it could be about two-thirds the size of Lake Winnebago," Bernard Schaber said. "And Lake Winnebago, I encourage you to go there. I’ve ridden my bike around it and it’s a hundred miles-plus to ride your bike around the lake." Size would help determine whether the mine would help create thousands of jobs, as its supporters contend, as well as what impact it would have on land and water. So let’s see if Bernard Schaber’s comparison measures up. Billion-dollar mine News surfaced in November 2010 that Gogebic Taconite proposed to spend more than $1 billion to develop an open-pit iron ore mine more than 300 miles northwest of Milwaukee in far northern Wisconsin. It would take years to open the mine, if various government approvals are won. Gogebic Taconite hasn’t made a formal proposal to the state as it waits to see whether Assembly Bill 426, which has generated lobbying activity by 34 organizations, becomes law. The bill, which would relax environmental standards and public participation in the review process for the mine, was approved Jan. 26, 2012 by the Republican-controlled Assembly, with Bernard Schaber and every other Democrat in attendance voting no. Gogebic president Bill Williams told PolitiFact Wisconsin the company would need up to 5,000 acres to encompass the mine -- roughly four miles long and a half-mile wide -- and facilities such as roads, waste-rock storage and ore processing. That would be nowhere near two-thirds the size of Lake Winnebago, which has an area of about 138,000 acres. We sought out a state mine expert and spoke with Ann Coakley, director of the waste and materials management bureau of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. She noted Gogebic has spoken about a possibly wider mine -- 1.5 miles wide rather than a half-mile. But even at that, she estimated that the total footprint likely would be 10,000 acres. That, too, is much less than two-thirds the area of Lake Winnebago. Lawmaker's evidence So, does Bernard Schaber have evidence that the mine would be two-thirds as big as the lake? No and yes. Legislative aide Eric Koch said his boss believes the space needed for the related facilities, added to the mine itself, would make the total footprint two-thirds the size of the lake. But he acknowledged she has no solid data to support that estimate. In a written summary and other documents Bernard Schaber provided to back up her claim, she introduced a different measurement: volume. She starts with the dimensions of Lake Winnebago, citing a DNR document. If we round the figures Bernard Schaber cites, the lake has an area of nearly 138,000 acres, which is about 6 billion square feet. She multiplies 6 billion square feet by the lake’s average depth of 15.5 feet, for a total of 93 billion cubic feet. Now to the size of the mine. Noting that Gogebic Taconite has given varying dimensions of what the size of the mine itself might be, Bernard Schaber used a length of 4.5 miles and a width of three-quarters of a mile. That comes to 3.375 square miles or about 94 million square feet. She multiplies that figure by 1,000 feet, which has been the reported depth of the mine, to come up with a total of 94 billion cubic feet -- a volume even larger than Lake Winnebago’s. Gogebic Taconite’s Williams told us the mine’s depth would range from 700 to 1,000 feet. But even if we used 700 instead of 1,000 in the equation, we’d get a mine depth of 66 billion cubic feet -- more than two-thirds the volume of Lake Winnebago. So, when depth is added to length and width, the mine is at or near the size of the lake. But at the hearing Bernard Schaber -- who spoke of biking around the lake -- was clearly referring to area, not volume. Our rating Bernard Schaber said "the central size" of a mine proposed for far northern Wisconsin "could be about two-thirds the size of Lake Winnebago." There’s an element of truth in her statement, in terms of volume. But she lacks evidence to back her central claim, which was area. We rate her statement Mostly False.

Highlights of the plan include deporting all undocumented immigrants, ending birthright citizenship and "making Mexico pay for the wall." "For many years, Mexico’s leaders have been taking advantage of the United States by using illegal immigration to export the crime and poverty in their own country," the position page on Trump’s website reads. "The costs for the United States have been extraordinary. ... Indeed, the annual cost of free tax credits alone paid to illegal immigrants quadrupled to $4.2 billion in 2011." The $4.2 billion figure caught our eye. Though Trump’s campaign didn’t get back to us, we found a 2011 audit by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration that corroborates his claim. Nonetheless, Trump confuses a few points. In 2009 (not, as Trump says, in 2011), "individuals who are not authorized to work in the United States were paid $4.2 billion in refundable credits, according to the report. That’s indeed more than four times the amount in 2005 ($924 million). How did this happen? Although undocumented immigrants can’t get a Social Security Number, they can file taxes with a different nine-digit number, the Individual Taxpayer Identification Number or ITIN. Experts told us that illegal immigrants make up the vast majority of ITIN filers, though there’s no way of knowing just how many. The group also includes legal immigrants (refugees, asylum seekers, spouses), foreign workers (professors, technology workers, people who own businesses in America but live abroad), and dependents of both citizens and immigrants. Regardless of immigration status, ITIN filers are not eligible for Social Security. According to the Social Security Administration, undocumented immigrants doled out an estimated $12 billion in payroll taxes but will never get the benefits. Also, ITIN filers can’t get the Earned Income Tax Credit, due to a provision in a 1996 law. ITIN filers, however, can receive the Additional Child Tax Credit, a refund given to people who owed less in taxes than deductions they could receive through the Child Tax Credit (up to $1,000 per child). The credit as it stands today was established in the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, one of the tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush. Unlike in 1996, Congress did not write a provision barring ITIN filers from claiming the refund. As a result, claims for the additional child credit have increased significantly since 2001, according to the Treasury Inspector General audit. By 2009, 2.3 million ITIN filers received $4.2 billion through the additional child credit, a four-fold increase over 2005. Here’s a chart from the audit: Under this current system for ITIN filers, "the government isn’t losing out," according to Bob Greenstein, president of the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. It gets more money in revenues than it gives out in credits. However, Greenstein told us it’s slightly misleading to say that the recipients of the child credit are illegal immigrants. "The vast majority of that $4.2 billion, the filer may be undocumented, but you have to have a child to receive it. And the children are overwhelmingly U.S. citizens," he said. In other words, the $4.2 billion in tax credits largely benefits American-born children, whose parents are admittedly undocumented immigrants. Trump’s immigration plan actually addresses this potential issue: He calls for an end to birthright citizenship. "So his position is pretty consistent," pointed out Greenstein. Our ruling Trump said, "The annual cost of free tax credits alone paid to illegal immigrants quadrupled to $4.2 billion in 2011." Based on an audit by the Treasury Inspector General, the claim leaves out some context. Trump conflates "illegal immigrants" with "unauthorized workers," a group composed largely of undocumented immigrants but also legal immigrants and others. The $4.2 billion refers to the amount given in tax credit refunds for children, the large majority of whom are U.S. citizens. And the actual year is 2009, not 2011 (that was the year the report was published). Also, it's important to note that illegal immigrants pay an estimated $12 billion in payroll taxes to Social Security and don't receive benefits. So Trump is leaving out a significant part of the picture when it comes to taxes and undocumented workers. Overall, we rate his claim Half True.

pomt-03948	"Collectively states are spending more on Medicaid than they do on K-12 education."	true	/virginia/statements/2013/feb/19/eric-cantor/cantor-says-states-are-spending-more-medicaid-publ/	House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-7th, is urging lawmakers to make Medicaid more flexible, effective and cheaper for states to run. "Under the Medicaid system the rules are set in Washington, but much of the bills are paid in our state capitals," he said during his Feb. 5 "Make Life Work" speech at a conservative think tank in Washington "Collectively states are spending more on Medicaid than they do on K-12 education." We looked into the claim that states are paying more for Medicaid than public education. Cantor’s staff told us the information came from a report, published by the National Association of State Budget Officers last fall, that tallied where states get and spend their money. The study found that states planned to spend a total $1.7 trillion in fiscal 2012. Of the sum, 39.8 percent would come from general fund moneys that are collected through statewide taxes, 31.2 percent from federal grants and the remaining 29 percent from other state funds and bonds. Medicaid, which provides health care for the poor, was expected to be the most expensive item in the collective state budgets. States were projected to spend $406 billion on the service, or 23.9 percent of their total budgets. Elementary and secondary education came in second, drawing $336 billion, or 19.8 percent of total expenses. But there’s a catch to these figures: The federal government provides states with about 56 percent of what they spend on Medicaid, according to NASBO report. So Cantor is including as state expenses about $228 billion that Uncle Sam sends to the states for Medicaid. The picture changes if we simply examine the portions of Medicaid and public education that states pay out of their general funds. Public schools rise to the top of the expense list, drawing an expected $235 billion last fiscal year, or 34.7 percent of all general fund spending. Medicaid falls to a distant No. 2, receiving an estimated $133 billion, or 19.6 percent of general fund outlays. Experts we spoke to didn’t express a preference for one accounting method or the other. "We include both methods in our report," said Stacy Mazer, senior staff associate at NASBO. "One reason we’ve been using total funds is that some states define their funds differently. And one of the other issues is that even though it’s not all your money, you’re still administering it." Tracy Gordon, a fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, said most health care industry analysts use a total figure cited by Cantor, but note that it includes federal dollars. Arturo Perez, a fiscal analyst with the National Conference of State Legislatures, said his organization tracks states’ general fund spending and considers K-12 education to be the greatest recipient of state money. Our ruling Cantor said states are spending more on Medicaid than on education. His statement is correct, although it should be noted that a substantial portion of the dollars states are spending on Medicaid come from the federal government. We rate Cantor’s statement True.

pomt-02508	On repealing the 17th Amendment	full flop	/texas/statements/2014/feb/13/dan-patrick/dan-patrick-went-unequivocally-support-would-not-b/	"Flip flop," begins a Jan. 22, 2014, news blog entry from the San Antonio Express-News. "That’s exactly what Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst and state Sen. Dan Patrick, both trying to capture the tea party vote in the Republican primary, did earlier this week when posed a question about repealing the 17th Amendment." The 17th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, ratified in 1913, did away with state legislatures electing U.S. senators and handed that power directly to the people. It begins, "The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, elected by the people thereof, for six years; and each Senator shall have one vote." At the time, the 17th Amendment was seen as a move away from corruption and toward purer democracy, according to an Oct. 10, 2013, Austin American-Statesman news blog post and an Oct. 16 Statesman news story. But tea party activists, particularly in Texas, describe it as a mistake that reduced state power by undoing an intended balance between U.S. representatives elected locally by the people and U.S. senators more accountable to state legislators. Another Republican candidate for lieutenant governor, Texas land commissioner Jerry Patterson, said in a Waco Tribune-Herald interview published Feb. 2 and in subsequent emails to us that Patrick and Dewhurst each said in an Oct. 3 debate that he favored repeal, then changed his tune at a Jan. 20 King Street Patriots debate. Patterson and another GOP candidate, Texas agriculture commissioner Todd Staples, who weren’t asked about repeal at the October debate, each said at the later debate that he opposes repealing the amendment, according to a YouTube video that King Street spokesman Logan Churchwell told us by phone accurately presented the candidates’ responses. To gauge whether Dewhurst and Patrick flip-flopped, we reviewed the cited debates, checked news accounts and reached out to their respective campaigns. (Our check of Dewhurst’s statements is here.) An Oct. 10 Statesman news blog post quoted Patrick as saying at the Oct. 3 debate held in Houston by the Clear Lake Tea Party: "I unequivocally support the repeal of the 17th Amendment and the restoration of our Founders' original intent to have the state legislatures select our United States senators. ... It is absolutely necessary that the 17th Amendment be repealed to revitalize our republican system of government." At the Jan. 20 King Street debate in Houston, according to the YouTube video, Patrick said: "I think this came up in a debate about four months ago. We’ve had many debates. And I think either I misspoke or I was misquoted or it was reported incorrectly; I’m not sure which. ... I would not be in position to support repealing it today. I was just taking a historical view of it and I think that was a turning point; it hasn’t worked out, I think, as planned, but I would not be in favor of repealing it." Patrick spokesman Logan Spence told us by email that there was "No flip. Dan just doesn't think now is the time to have that fight." We asked how this "not now" position coheres with Patrick flatly saying at the January debate that he is not in favor of repeal. Spence replied that as a candidate for lieutenant governor, Patrick is not positioned to lead the charge for repeal "now or in the near future." He also said, "This must be my last time to address this." Our ruling Between the October and January debates, Patrick shifted from saying "I unequivocally support the repeal of the 17th Amendment" to "I would not be in favor of repealing it." Given an opportunity to explain the contrast, his campaign said Patrick wouldn’t be positioned as lieutenant governor to lead the repeal charge and that there would be no further clarification. Our sense is that Patrick himself said he was for repeal, then said he is not. That’s a Full Flop. FULL FLOP -- A major reversal of position; a complete flip-flop. UPDATED Feb. 13, 5:07 pm: This story was updated to restore a paragraph defining the 17th Amendment that had been omitted due to an editing error.

pomt-14107	Germany "is crime-riddled right now" because of migration to Europe.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/11/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-germany-now-riddled-crime-thanks/	After his GOP opponents dropped out of the race, Donald Trump was asked on NBC Nightly News if he would soften his opinions on immigration. "As you try to appeal to the entire country, do you stand by them? Do you stand, for example, by the idea of a ban against foreign Muslims coming in?" asked anchor Lester Holt. "I do," said Trump. "We have to be vigilant. We have to be strong. We have to see what's going on. There's a big problem in the world. You look what's happening with the migration in Europe. You look at Germany, it's crime-riddled right now." A reader asked us to check if Trump was accurately characterizing what is going on in Germany in the wake of the German government's willingness to accept migrants, particularly its decision in August to waive rules for Syrian refugees seeking sanctuary. About 1.1 million arrived last year from the Middle East, Asia and Africa. We emailed Trump's spokeswoman to ask for the source of his claim, but we didn't hear back. When something is riddled, it's filled with something undesirable. When a body is riddled with bullets, it has a lot of bullets. Without knowing the precise point at which a city is "riddled" with crime, we'll look at the data to see if Germany now has a lot of crime. Germany's crime rate, particularly violent crime, is far lower than in the United States. The U.S. murder rate, for example, is nearly six times higher than Germany's, according to the most recent report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Government data show that despite a 440 percent increase in migrants, crime among that group only increased by 79 percent last year. We found out that the German government has repeatedly studied the question of crime and migrants. According to the Bundeskriminalamt, also known as the Federal Criminal Police Office or BKA, crimes by immigrants rose 79 percent in 2015. But at the same time, the number of refugees in the country rose more than fivefold — by 440 percent. In other words, the typical German was more likely to engage in crime than the average migrant. Not only that, the BKA found that the increase was in the first half of 2015. The rate then leveled off during the second half of the year, the period with the greatest influx of refugees, according to the German broadcaster Deutsche Welle. Nonetheless, in terms of raw numbers, that's 92,000 more crimes committed by migrants than in previous years. Instances of assaults, robberies and "predatory extortion," a classification that includes threatening behavior, doubled over 2015. Smaller offenses, such as theft (mostly shoplifting), forging paperwork to get money and riding on public transport without paying the fare, nearly doubled. According to Die Welt (The World), a national German newspaper, most of the crimes committed by refugees are related to theft or trying to ride on public transport without tickets. Fewer than 1 percent, or less than 1,000, are sex crimes, in spite of social media rumors. However, concern over sex crimes peaked New Year's Eve amid widespread reports of groups of drunken North African migrants — Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco — sexually assaulting hundreds of women in Cologne and other cities. Those reports dovetailed with a 2014 study that found 40 percent of refugees from that region had gotten into legal trouble within 12 months of their arrival versus 0.5 percent of Syrians. A later analysis also revealed that migrants from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan were much less likely to be charged with a crime than migrants from other regions such as the Western Balkans, demonstrating that you can't lump all migrants together. Groups concerned about the influx of migrants believe that the government may not be giving the full story. The reports that migrants are generating less crime than other Germans have been met with some criticism. Data from a few states were not included, for example, and the New Year's Eve sexual assaults didn't make it into the latest report. It should also be noted that some of the additional crime has consisted of attacks on migrants and migrant camps. By the end of October, the number of attacks against shelters for asylum seekers had tripled compared to the count for all of 2014. When we compared the U.S. State Department's annual reports on German crime and safety from 2014 to 2016, we found that the low-to-medium risk in 2014 had, by the 2015 report, risen to a medium rating for most cities. The 2016 report specifically mentions the refugee problem: "While the 2014 statistics (the latest available) for Germany are of interest, they fail to capture any effect that the approximately 1 million refugees and asylum seekers who arrived in country in 2015 may have had on crime." It quotes some alarming statistics from the first quarter of 2015, but, as we've noted, the German government has released more up-to-date information that shows the initial refugee crime leveled off in the latter half of 2015. The crime and safety report also says, "A number of ranking police officers have questioned the accuracy of the statistics being provided, specifically related to crimes taking place within refugee camps or being committed by refugees." But overall, "To our knowledge, there have been no large-scale empirical studies that have shown a connection between large-scale immigration and spikes in crime. In fact many studies show the opposite," said Natalia Banulescu-Bogdan, assistant director of the international program at the Migration Policy Institute and a fellow at MPI Europe in Brussels. "It is important to be very careful about causation versus correlation," she said. Youth unemployment, being forced to wait while seeking asylum or trying to reunite with family members can increase tensions, but conditions such as youth unemployment can spark crime among non-migrants as well. "There is nothing to suggest, however, that there is anything specific to refugee populations in general, or to those seeking asylum in Europe in particular, that predisposes them to crime," said Banulescu-Bogdan. "In fact the opposite is more likely to be true, because there is so much more riding on their ability to avoid encounters with police and jeopardize their future in the country." Our ruling Trump said Germany "is crime-riddled right now" because of migration to Europe. There are more criminal acts in Germany these days because there are more people, thanks to the influx of 1.1 million refugees in 2015 alone. But the data suggest that the refugees tend to be better-behaved than the typical German. Even if you presume that refugee-related crime is underreported for political reasons, we could find no evidence in German media reports that the country warrants Trump's riddled-with-crime characterization. Because his statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Meist Falsch — Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/de3b3f76-de96-4103-8010-4a5d036cb6f6	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-05-11T15:49:39	2016-05-04	['Europe', 'Germany']
pomt-02194	Says Charlie Crist's campaign bashed Sen. Bill Nelson's "big-government solutions."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/apr/25/msnbc/msnbc-labels-florida-republican-charlie-crist-advi/	The national media is abuzz, again, about the possibility of Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., shaking up the Florida governor’s race. Nelson has repeatedly said he has no plans to enter, but he hasn’t flatly ruled out a scenario in which he enters the race if Democratic front-runner Charlie Crist appears to flame out against Republican incumbent Gov. Rick Scott. A new poll has Crist and Scott tied with 42 percent of the vote, while other polls generally have shown Crist ahead. On Wednesday at a luncheon with Daytona Beach business leaders, Nelson zinged Scott for rejecting high-speed rail financed by federal stimulus dollars and not pushing harder for billions of federal dollars to expand Medicaid to poor, uninsured residents. "I think it’s not only a shame," Nelson said, according to the Daytona Beach News-Journal. "I think it’s a moral abscess." The speech generated headlines that Nelson was toying with the idea of running. That, in turn, spawned reaction from Scott’s campaign chairman, state Sen. John Thrasher, R-St. Augustine. "His solutions are federally based solutions — not Florida-based solutions," Thrasher said in criticizing Nelson. Why are we writing about any of this at PunditFact? Because MSNBC’s Daily Rundown got it mixed up in a segment about the story featuring input from Chuck Todd from Seoul, South Korea, Tampa Bay Times political editor Adam Smith and fill-in host Kristen Welker. After Smith noted a concern among Democrats that Crist "could wind up as a train wreck," Welker noted, "Crist’s campaign is actually responding, which is interesting. He says of Bill Nelson, or his campaign chairman says, ‘His solutions are federally based solutions — not Florida-based solutions.’ So Crist really feeling the heat here, pushing back. What do you make of that?" A chart also wrongly referred to Thrasher as Crist’s campaign chairman. This is the same man who just this week released a statement saying, "We are very confident in our campaign to show Charlie Crist's failure as governor in contrast to Gov. Scott's record of job creation." The segment prompted Crist adviser Kevin Cate to tweet, "Correction for @dailyrundown: @John_Thrasher is not our chair & we didn't bash Nelson. cc: @chucktodd @adamsmithtimes pic.twitter.com/149Etntdyq" After we began reporting this item, MSNBC acknowledged its mistake: "Bad mix-up on our part w/@John_Thrasher quote today. Our apologies to him & @CharlieCrist campaign." Our ruling MSNBC wrongly attached the words of Scott’s campaign chairman to the Crist campaign. Crist’s campaign chairman did not blast the prospect of Nelson entering the Florida governor’s race. Scott’s did. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-10406	"We are winning the popular vote."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/03/hillary-clinton/counting-votes-is-tricky-this-year/	After winning the primary in Puerto Rico on June 1, 2008, Sen. Hillary Clinton proclaimed in her victory speech, "We are winning the popular vote!" Clinton's implicit argument is that she may trail Sen. Barack Obama in delegates — the representatives who attend the convention and formally choose the nominee — but she's winning by another measure that should be more compelling. It's an argument that could resonate with the Democrats' bitter memory of the 2000 campaign, when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost to George W. Bush in the Electoral College. But it's important to note that general elections are very different from nominating contests. In the general election, people in every state vote on the same day. For the nominating contest, people don't always vote — sometimes they caucus — and the political parties control when and how the contests unfold. Which brings us to the significant problems with the way Clinton arrives at her winning number. These problems chiefly have to do with the state of Michigan. Recall that before the nominating process kicked off with the Iowa caucuses back in January, Michigan and Florida moved their primaries to earlier in the year without the authorization of the Democratic Party. As punishment, the party stripped the two states of their delegates, and Clinton and Obama promised not to campaign in the states. This very likely suppressed turnout. "They were not elections that were conducted as free and fair elections in any sense of the words," said Anthony Corrado, professor of government at Colby College in Maine. In Florida, neither candidate campaigned, and Clinton beat Obama by a good margin, about 17 percent. In Michigan, state rules allowed candidates to remove their names from the ballot, which Obama and several other Democratic candidates did. Clinton, however, did not remove her name. In the primary, Clinton faced off against Chris Dodd, Mike Gravel, Dennis Kucinich and Uncommitted. When Clinton calculates her popular vote lead, there's no way she can get to a winning number unless she counts Michigan, where Obama's name was not on the ballot. The Clinton campaign has said Obama didn't have to take his name off the ballot, which is true, but counting a Clinton victory over Obama when his name didn't appear on the ballot is dubious. Another problem with the nomination process is the difficulty with counting voter support in caucus states. Caucuses can work different ways, but in some cases voters don't cast traditional ballots. In Iowa's Democratic caucus, for instance, supporters stand in different parts of a meeting room. Minor candidates are knocked out of the running, and their supporters in turn pick new candidates. At the end of the night, each candidate's support is translated into state delegates, who attend a state convention and then pick delegates to go to the national convention. But there's never a formal tally of individual caucusgoers. In caucuses, the best that can be done is to calculate estimates, based on state delegates and turnout estimates; Obama holds a sizable lead in these contests. The news Web site RealClearPolitics has developed caucus estimates for Iowa, Nevada, Maine and Washington, and has applied it to several scenarios involving Michigan: * If you don't count Michigan, Obama wins the popular vote with or without caucus estimates. * If you do count Michigan, Clinton wins the popular vote with or without caucus estimates. * If you count Michigan and award Uncommitted's votes to Obama, then Obama wins with the caucus estimates, and Clinton wins without caucus estimates. Obama could similarly claim to lead the popular vote, Corrado said. But Clinton is talking about the popular votes because she can't say she has won the most delegates or the most states. "The bottom line is that they have divided the vote up fairly closely," he said. "It shows how closely contested the race was between these two candidates. It's really remarkable when you think about it." Indeed, in every scenario presented by RealClearPolitics, whether Obama leads or Clinton leads, the difference between the two candidates is less than 1 percent. For Clinton's statement to be true, a lot hinges on how you think Michigan's votes should be counted, and how you handle voter support in the caucus states. We can't say how Obama would have done in Michigan if his name had been on the ballot, but he certainly would have garnered more than zero votes. The wishes of voters in caucus states should also be considered for a claim on the popular vote. Finally, some could argue that you shouldn't count Florida since neither candidate campaigned there. For all of these reasons, we find Clinton's argument that she's winning the popular vote to be true only if you consider the messy, real-world results in the light most favorable to Clinton, and for this reason we find her claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-14798	Jeb Bush’s plan for Social Security is "disastrous for seniors and raises the retirement age to 70."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2015/nov/30/annette-taddeo-goldstein/jeb-bushs-social-security-plan-raises-retirement-a/	Congressional hopeful Annette Taddeo warned Florida seniors preparing for a Thanksgiving feast that a Jeb Bush presidency could starve their plans for retirement. Taddeo, the former chair of the Miami-Dade Democratic Party, attempted to link Bush’s plan for Social Security to her Republican opponent, Carlos Curbelo of Miami, in a fundraising email PolitiFact Florida received Nov. 24, 2015 (click here to read the letter). "Have you seen presidential hopeful Jeb Bush’s plan for Social Security? It’s disastrous for seniors and raises the retirement age to 70," the email read. "But Bush is the candidate Annette’s opponent, Congressman Carlos Curbelo, thinks should be leading our country. Not that that’s a surprise after Curbelo called Social Security a ‘Ponzi scheme’ and voted for Speaker Ryan’s devastating budget. South Florida needs someone who will fight for Social Security — not work to end it." Curbelo did call Social Security a Ponzi scheme in his first bid for Congress. That is not an accurate description of the program, so we rated Curbelo's statement False. For this fact-check, we wanted to know if Bush really released a Social Security plan for seniors that raises the retirement age to 70. (We won’t weigh in on whether it’s "disastrous.") We found that Bush's plan doesn't suggest a specific age, and he also doesn't think the eligibility age should change for current seniors. Bush’s comments Taddeo’s campaign directed us to a condensed version of Bush’s plan to reform Medicare and Social Security on Medium.com, which linked to the full plan on his website. Bush proposes allowing small businesses to set up collective or individual retirement accounts for workers. He also wants to slow down the growth of costs by cutting payments to higher-income seniors who have been able to save more while increasing minimum payments. Relevant to this fact-check, he suggests raising the retirement age, although he doesn’t say by how much. He says working longer is something many workers desire. "We need to recognize that Americans are living longer, healthier lives, and we should make it easier for those who choose to work longer," Bush wrote. "Life expectancy has increased substantially since Social Security was created in 1935. Yet Social Security’s structure still discourages work past the age of 62. Reforms should update Social Security to respect seniors’ desires and abilities to work later in life." That doesn’t mention 70 as the potential new retirement age for full benefits, though Bush did use that number earlier this year on CBS’ Face the Nation. Host Bob Schieffer noted during the May 31 interview that Bush favored raising the age and asked him how high. "I think it needs to be phased in over an extended period of time. I have seen ideas that are 68, for example," Bush said. "So people that already have the supplemental retirement system, which is a contract, I don't think we violate that. For people that are about ready to be beneficiaries of their supplemental retirement, I don't think we change that. But we need to look over the horizon and begin to phase in over an extended period of time going from 65 to 68 or 70. And that by itself will help sustain the retirement system for anybody under the age of 40." Bush has made similar comments at other points this year, though he only gave a specific age range to Schieffer. He has repeatedly said his plan would not affect current retirees or Americans nearing it. Bush told an audience in New Hampshire on April 17, "I think we need to raise the retirement age, not for the people that already nearing (or) receiving Social Security ... but raise it gradually over a long period of time for people that are just entering the system." And on June 2, a few days after appearing on Face the Nation, Bush told Fox News’ Neil Cavuto, "Social Security — I think we need to adjust it, because life expectancy has gone up, … adjusted by retirement age going up. … If we're going to fix it for the next 50 years, we need to start working on it now and progressively raise the retirement age. But people that are near retirement or already in retirement, I don't believe there should be any (impact)." We should note that in his Face the Nation comments, Bush was wrong about the current retirement age. Bush suggested that the current retirement age for full benefits is 65, but that’s only for people born in 1937 or earlier. For people born between 1943 and 1954, the current retirement age for full benefits is 66, and the age rises incrementally after that. Those born in 1960 or later will get full benefits at 67. It’s clear Bush has brought up raising the retirement age for future Social Security beneficiaries as a way to stabilize the program. But Taddeo’s characterization of what he has said falls short on several fronts. Our ruling Taddeo said Bush’s plan for Social Security is "disastrous for seniors and raises the retirement age to 70." Taddeo has a point that Bush said he is open to the idea of raising retirement ages, but her email mischaracterizes his plan. Her email attempts to convince seniors nearing retirement that benefit changes are imminent if Bush is elected. Bush has repeatedly said he does not intend to alter Social Security for current retirees or those who would be joining the program soon. And while 70 is one of several ages Bush threw out in an interview, his official plan doesn't establish specifics beyond stating age reforms are needed. Taddeo’s statement contains an element of truth about Bush’s plan for Social Security but exaggerates that point to scare seniors. We rate the statement Mostly False.

Cresent Hardy. Hardy represents just one of a handful of Republican-held House seats that lean Democratic, and his is widely considered one of the most "flippable" seats in 2016. The district includes parts of North Las Vegas and stretches across southern Nevada. Several high-profile Democrats have announced their candidacy, and attacks are already flying in one of the most-watched and well-funded congressional races in the country. Former Assemblywoman Lucy Flores, who made waves after endorsing Sen. Bernie Sanders for president, has aggressively gone after State Sen. Ruben Kihuen, who is generally considered the frontrunner after gaining the support of Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid and the state’s powerful Culinary Union. At a January candidate forum in rural Pahrump, Nev, Flores portrayed Kihuen (pronounced KEY-WIN) as an ineffective lawmaker and attacked his record, including a signature bill passed in 2015 expanding low-income college scholarships. "Frankly, he only managed in the minority to get one bill passed out of the eight to 10 that he introduced," she said. "And the college bill was actually primarily sponsored by the Republican majority leader, so of course the Republican majority leader wasn’t going to let that bill fail." We thought her claim merited fact-checking. Kihuen’s legislative record has been scrutinized since 2011, when the Las Vegas Sun pointed out he was one of two lawmakers who did not introduce a single bill in the legislative session. The Flores campaign pointed to that article, and provided a list of bills that Kihuen introduced during the 2015 legislative session as evidence of Kihuen’s ineffectiveness. (The Nevada Legislature only meets for six months every two years.) Flores’ allegation is mostly on the mark. Of the eight bills introduced by Kihuen in 2015, only one was ultimately signed into law — a bill allowing the county commissioners in Las Vegas to propose up to a $14 fee on marriage licenses to promote marriage tourism. But she misidentifies the co-sponsor of arguably Kihuen’s biggest legislative accomplishment. (Flores owned up to the mistake after the forum.) Kihuen worked closely with Republican Assistant Majority Leader Ben Kieckhefer in passing the state’s first need-based college scholarship program. The "Silver State Opportunity Grant Program" allocates $5 million over two years for low-income students enrolled in Nevada community colleges and universities, and more than 670 students are signed up. Kieckhefer said the bill originated from a college affordability summit hosted by the two before the legislative session, and he credited Kihuen for helping push the legislation through with minimal opposition. "Ruben and I were partners on this bill, and I know he worked it hard on his side," he said. Flores’s comments also strike at a larger issue - finding the best way to measure legislative effectiveness. Kihuen’s campaign manager, Dave Chase, said because Democrats were in the minority during the session, it makes more sense to measure effectiveness by what Kihuen was able to prevent from happening. "The real work comes in committee and on the floor, where Ruben, while in the minority, fought to kill reckless Republican bills that would have ended collective bargaining, overtime pay and rolled back key voting rights all while passing 19 bills he sponsored," he wrote in an email. "Ms. Flores should ask the 700 students going to college right now thanks to Ruben's work if he was effective last session." Kihuen served as part of the leadership team for the 10-person Democratic caucus, and Senate Democratic head Aaron Ford praised Kihuen’s work during the legislative session. As for the critical 2011 article in the Sun, Damore said he was "hesitant" to lend much credence to a five-year old article and recommended looking at Kihuen’s more recent legislative accomplishments. A full list is here. Six of the ten bills introduced by Kihuen during the 2013 session were eventually signed into law. UNLV political science professor David Damore said it’s difficult to measure legislative effectiveness based solely on the raw numbers of bills proposed and laws that are passed. "Certainly factors such as majority or minority status as well as seniority play into passage, and of course not every bill that gets passed should be become law, and not all that do have an equal impact," he said in an email. Nevada lawmakers are also limited as to the number of bills they can propose during the session, so legislators can’t propose dozens of bills to pad their numbers. Our ruling Flores said Kihuen "only managed in the minority to get one bill passed out of the eight to 10 he introduced" during the 2015 legislative session. Flores is technically accurate in her criticism. But the insinuation that he was an ineffective legislator because of that ignores some important context about the realities of being in the minority party and his role in passing other legislation behind the scenes. Her claim is accurate but needs additional context. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Lucy Flores	None	None	None	2016-02-08T15:21:04	2016-01-21	['None']
pomt-05570	Says Texas retained the right to have a navy when it joined the United States.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2012/apr/04/chain-email/chain-email-says-texas-reserved-right-its-own-navy/	A Highway Patrol boat policing the Texas-Mexico border is part of the "Texas Navy," claims a chain email sent to us February 19, 2012. Alongside several pictures of a gun-carrying powerboat, the email says Texas is bringing new force to bear on drug cartel violence on the border. Falcon Lake will "soon be safe" as the Department of Public Safety launches "our first Naval vessel of this century," it says. It also claims, "When Texas joined the Union as a sovereign nation in 1836, we retained the right to have a Navy to ward off the Mexicans." Did Texas keep, at statehood, the right to have its own navy? First, about that gunboat: The craft pictured is part of the DPS’ Tactical Marine Unit, created in 2011. Laredo, McAllen and Brownsville region Commander Jose Rodriguez told us by telephone that it’s one of six shallow-water "interceptor" boats the state is buying for the marine unit -- which is not referred to as a "navy," he said. DPS says the fleet will patrol the Rio Grande, border lakes and Intracoastal Waterway. Second, let’s clear up a date error: Texas won its independence from Mexico in 1836 (the 176th anniversary of the decisive battle will be April 21, 2012) but didn’t join the United States until 1845. In between, the Republic of Texas was an independent country, complete with a president, Congress and embassies in Paris, London and Washington. The republic also had a navy -- two, in fact. The Texas State Historical Association’s Handbook of Texas says that to guard supply lines from New Orleans, Texas’ provisional government passed an "Act and Decree Establishing a Navy" on November 25, 1835. The first Texas Navy was four schooners purchased in January 1836 -- and all gone by mid-1837, according to the Handbook: The Liberty: Sold because Texas couldn’t pay its repair bills. The Invincible: Crew arrested and charged with piracy in New Orleans, but released. Hit a sandbar and sank while fighting Mexican navy. The Independence: Captured by Mexican navy. The Brutus: Ran aground, but not until after it had claimed Cozumel island for the Republic of Texas. Might have been nice. That sounds dire, but Jeff Hunt, director of the Texas Military Forces Museum at Camp Mabry in Austin and an adjunct history professor at Austin Community College, told us the sailors acquitted themselves well in combat, considering their lack of resources. In 1839, the Handbook says, Texas commissioned ships for a second navy. President Sam Houston thought the expense was extravagant and tried to sell the fleet in 1843. "The people of Galveston, incensed at the thought of selling the navy, attended the auction and by force prevented the submission of bids. Thus the navy was returned to the Republic of Texas. Nevertheless, the cruise ending in July 1843 marked the end of the operative career of the Texas Navy, as a truce with Mexico came that summer and the United States undertook to protect Texas until her annexation." When Texas became part of the United States, its ships were ceded to the U.S. Navy via the Treaty of Annexation, Joint Resolution for Annexing Texas to the United States and Texas’ 1845 Constitution. Historian T.R. Fehrenbach, author of "Lone Star: A History of Texas and the Texans," told us by email, "Texas did not retain the right to have its own navy under the annexation treaty." None of the three documents mentioned a right to have a state navy. Nor did seceding 16 years later change the terms, Fehrenbach said. "One thing that is often overlooked is that according to a (U.S.) Supreme Court decision, Texas was never considered out of the Union, merely staging a rebellion that failed, so all of the provisions of the 1845 document (annexation treaty) were retained as valid," he said. Then again, we noticed the state’s 1866 Constitution briefly mentions a state navy: "The Governor shall be commander-in-chief of the army and navy of this State, and of the militia, except when they shall be called into the service of the United States." That constitution "was obviated by the current one," Fehrenbach said. "Nothing in it is applicable." Texas’ current constitution, adopted in 1876, and its statutes make no mention of a Texas Navy other than to declare the third Saturday in September "Texian Navy Day," honoring the Republic’s two fleets. Curiously, Texas governors have for decades granted purely honorary "Texas Navy" commissions. Governor’s office spokeswoman Steffany Duke told us by email, "According to official records in both our office and the state archives, it appears that these ceremonial commissions date back to the late 1950s." The Texas Navy historical society says on its website that one of the first admirals was Hollywood dancer Ginger Rogers, commissioned by Gov. James V. Allred in 1936 (the year that the Dallasite starred as a sailor’s sweetheart in "Follow the Fleet"). The society, although sometimes called the state’s "Third Navy," is a purely historical group, created by Gov. Price Daniel in 1958. Modern Texas’ naval military force is the 230-member Maritime Regiment, created in 2006 as part of the Texas State Guard. Brig. Gen. Robert Bodisch told us by telephone that his regiment is an emergency force trained in search and rescue, cadaver recovery and other crisis responses. While it is part of the Texas Military Forces, he said, it’s not a navy, which would comprise full-time professional troops. Our ruling We found no evidence that Texas retained the right to its own navy on joining the United States. The email’s central claim isn’t just incorrect, it’s ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

pomt-12035	"President Obama used" his DACA order "to unilaterally confer U.S. citizenship."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2017/sep/15/ken-paxton/ken-paxton-obama-daca-citizenship-incorrect-claim-/	The lead lawyer for Texas state government hailed President Donald Trump’s rescission of predecessor Barack Obama’s move affording young unauthorized immigrants, sometimes called "Dreamers," renewable shields from deportation. Moreover, Attorney General Ken Paxton charged in a Sept. 5, 2017, press release, Obama "used that lawful-presence dispensation to unilaterally confer U.S. citizenship." A reader asked us to check on that. In his release, Paxton said the program that Trump gave Congress six months to restore granted lawful presence and work permits to nearly a million "unlawfully present aliens." That's close to solid. The Pew Research Center recently estimated that fewer immigrants, nearly 790,000 people with roots mostly in Mexico, have received work permits and deportation relief through the Obama-launched Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Yet citizenship wasn’t a declared offering via DACA. The June 2012 Homeland Security memo announcing the program said: "This memorandum confers no substantive right, immigration status or pathway to citizenship. Only the Congress, acting through its legislative authority, can confer these rights." Iowa senator touts figures So, what citizenship provision was Paxton talking about? By email, Kayleigh Lovvorn, a spokeswoman for the attorney general’s office, replied that DACA wasn’t intended to be a path to citizenship. But, Lovvorn wrote, figures released by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services indicate that 39,514 DACA recipients have been approved for Lawful Permanent Resident status," green cards, her email implying that such individuals could later seek citizenship. A web search led us to a Sept. 1, 2017, press release from Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, publicizing the USCIS figures. Grassley’s release said preliminary data "indicate that the Obama administration allowed thousands of DACA recipients to exploit an immigration law loophole to obtain green cards. The data also show that more than a thousand DACA recipients have already obtained citizenship." As of Aug. 21, 2017, Grassley’s release said, 45,447 DACA recipients had been approved for "advance parole" with 3,993 applicants getting applications denied. "This approval," the release says, "allows a DACA recipient to travel out of the country and legally return, making them eligible to adjust their immigration status and receive a green card." We’ll delve into "advance parole." But first, more numbers from Grassley’s release: 59,778 DACA recipients have applied for green cards with 39,514 approved. Also, the release said, 2,181 of the green-card recipients have applied for U.S. citizenship--with 1,056 becoming citizens, which would break out to 0.1 percent of DACA recipients becoming citizens, by our calculation. We spotted no elaboration in the release--and didn’t draw any from Grassley aides or Homeland Security--demonstrating that any of the tallied individuals obtained citizenship by virtue of being a DACA recipient. On the other hand, legal experts supportive of DACA told us the advance parole aspect of the program may have helped individuals attain legal residency and citizenship. In each instance, the experts stressed, a person getting citizenship would first need to have been sponsored by an immediate family member--most commonly a spouse--who was already a legal permanent resident or citizen, which would have been required regardless of an applicant’s DACA participation. Natalia Drelichman, an attorney for Austin-based American Gateways, which serves refugees and other immigrants, said by phone: "The fact that individuals are eligible to apply for green cards if they have a qualifying relative, somebody who can apply for them, is old news." Drelichman and others stressed that attaining citizenship, for any immigrant, is a multistep process. "Only some DACA recipients will be eligible for green cards," Drelichman said. "And the path from green card to citizenship is long and requires meeting certain obligations, including payment of federal income taxes, at least three years of continual legal permanent residency, and passing the" required "civics and history exam," Drelichman said. "There is no direct route to citizenship uniquely available to DACA holders." Employing advance parole We dug into advanced parole after hearing back from Arwen FitzGerald, a USCIS spokeswoman, who reaffirmed by email that an estimated 40,000 DACA recipients have received Legal Permanent Resident status and another 1,000 have become citizens. FitzGerald also said: "The majority of these cases received their status through a grant of advance parole." Separately, the Fact Checker at The Washington Post said in a Sept. 7, 2017, analysis that Grassley’s release failed to account for DACA recipients who wouldn’t have needed advance parole to seek legal residency because the beneficiaries had previously entered the U.S. with visas and not left in the meantime. All told, that story estimated that about 3,000 DACA recipients may have used the advance parole strategy to pursue legal residency. Advance parole, experts told us, reflects an element of immigration law that permits certain people living in the U.S. without legal authorization--including some members of the military and some juveniles-- to travel to a home country for a specified purpose and then have the opportunity, with federal approval, to return--and no longer be considered someone who’d entered the U.S. without permission. That clean-slate distinction can provide a lift because under U.S. law, it’s more difficult for someone living in the country after entering without legal permission to seek legal status. ‘An important strategy’ In a June 2016 memo on advance parole options for DACA recipients, the San Francisco-based Immigrant Legal Resource Center, which says it focuses on advancing immigrant rights, said DACA recipients approved for advance parole will, on return, "be paroled into the U.S., which is considered a lawful entry. This reentry with parole allows some of those immigrants more opportunities to seek permanent residence," according to the memo, which otherwise called such a request "an important strategy to consider." DACA recipients (unlike other immigrants seeking advance parole) must present a specific humanitarian, educational or employment reason for traveling to another country, the memo noted. Still, the center advised, someone who obtained advance parole wasn’t guaranteed re-entry. "When an advance parole recipient presents herself at a U.S. port-of-entry upon her return," the center said, "she will be subject to inspection by an immigration official who will make a discretionary decision as to whether she will be paroled into the United States." As Trump rescinded the DACA program, Homeland Security said new applications from DACA recipients for advance parole would no longer be accepted. Lawyers comment Drelichman, among expert attorneys we reached, called Paxton's statement "very misleading." If "you have DACA" status, she said, "it doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll be a U.S. citizen." David Leopold, a Cleveland immigration lawyer and former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, also was critical, deeming Paxton’s claim "a gross mischaracterization" of DACA, which did not confer citizenship, Leopold said. A San Diego immigration attorney, Cesar Luna, noted by phone that whether a person landed advance parole or not, she or he still would have needed a sponsoring immediate family member to pursue citizenship. "You have to have another latch," Luna said. Our ruling Paxton said President Obama used the order creating DACA "to unilaterally confer U.S. citizenship." It’s flat-out incorrect to say that Obama via DACA conferred citizenship on anyone. That’s not how the system works, and the attorney general should know better. This unsupported characterization traces to a few DACA recipients--about a tenth of 1 percent—who gained citizenship in part by returning from abroad with a clean slate in accord with existing laws not amended by DACA.

pomt-02091	In the Georgia-Russia conflict, "we flew a brigade of Georgian soldiers" from Iran to Georgia and "sent U.S. ships into the Black Sea and provided various kinds of supplies."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/may/19/dick-cheney/cheney-bush-admin-did-more-help-georgia-obama-has-/	As events have proved, Russian President Vladimir Putin exerts far more influence than the West over the fate of Ukraine. On Fox News Sunday, former Vice President Dick Cheney faulted President Barack Obama for giving Putin the sense that he could take advantage of a weak U.S. policy. When he was reminded that Russia had done exactly as it pleased on Georgian territory under the George W. Bush administration, Cheney said that was different. "What we did at the time was, I think, a more robust response," Cheney said. "We flew in a brigade of Georgian soldiers that had been involved supporting our efforts in Iraq, flew them back into Georgia. We tried to provide some support there, as well as sent U.S. ships into the Black Sea and provided various kinds of supplies." Other Republicans have made the same point. We are not able to compare the robustness of the Bush and Obama responses to Russia but we can add some details about the Georgian troops and the U.S. supplies. A quick recap In 2008, armed conflict erupted in Georgia over two separatist regions within Georgia, South Ossetia and Abkhazia. After several years of restiveness by Russian-backed rebels in South Ossetia, the Georgian government made a military push that attempted to retake control of the region in August 2008. Russia responded militarily, successfully pushing back Georgian troops from both South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Clashes continued for a week, including in portions of Georgia beyond the two breakaway regions, until France helped broker a peace deal. Russia then recognized South Ossetia and Abkhazia as sovereign nations, though most other countries have not taken that step. The Georgian brigade airlift On Aug. 11, 2008, Agence France-Presse reported that the U.S. military had "nearly completed" the airlift of 2,000 Georgian troops from Iraq to Georgia. At the time, the United States took pains to portray its actions as being limited rather than aggressive. Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman told reporters that the United States was "fulfilling our agreement with the Georgian government that, in an emergency, we will assist them in redeploying their troops. We are honoring that commitment." Whitman told reporters at the time that the 130 U.S. troops and military contractors who were already in the country to train Georgian troops had been brought together at an undisclosed location away from the hostilities. And Whitman made clear to reporters that -- contrary to allegations by Putin -- the United States was not flying the Iraq-based Georgian troops to the war zone. The U.S. war ships The United States -- and its military alliance, NATO -- did indeed have ships in the Black Sea near Georgia in August 2008, but the story behind their presence is more nuanced than an unmistakable show of force against Russian aggression. The administration sent the guided missile destroyer McFaul to the Georgian port of Batumi, but it was loaded with humanitarian aid. "At the time, these gestures were not viewed as particularly strong," said Lincoln Mitchell, who was chief of party for the National Democratic Institute in Georgia from 2002 to 2004 and is now affiliated with the Arnold A. Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies at Columbia University. Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili "complained throughout the war that he was not getting support," Mitchell told PunditFact in March. David L. Phillips is director of Columbia University’s program on peace-building and rights. "There was never any chance of the Bush administration going to war in Georgia, and everybody knew that," Phillips said. "It was for show. It would be misleading to suggest that our response was so robust that it deterred further aggression." Our ruling Cheney said the Bush administration flew Georgian troops back to Georgia and used American war ships to provide supplies during that country’s conflict with Russia. While both actions took place, the troops were not sent into combat against Russian forces and the supplies were humanitarian. Neither effort tipped the military balance in Georgia’s favor. The statement has a measure of truth but leaves out some important nuances. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-13782	"A million Democrats deserted (Howard Dean’s) party and joined my party because of Donald Trump in Ohio this year."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2016/jul/20/hugh-hewitt/hugh-hewitt-million-ohio-democrats-changed-parties/	Republican radio host and pundit Hugh Hewitt slammed the Democratic party on a July 20 MSNBC panel, charging that the party failed the Rust Belt economically and prompted liberal voters to jump ship. Hewitt was part of a panel that included former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, a Democratic presidential candidate in 2004 and a former party chairman. "A million Democrats deserted Howard’s party and joined my party because of Donald Trump in Ohio this year," Hewitt said. The 2016 Republican primary was remarkable, given the 17-candidate field. Is Hewitt’s "million" figure right? And is Trump the reason behind a massive party switch in the Buckeye State? In Ohio, party affiliation is determined by what ballot a voter requests in a primary election. The voter will continue to be affiliated with that party, unless he or she requests a different party’s ballot in another primary election. The Cleveland Plain Dealer reported that 5 percent of voters in Ohio who cast ballots in the March 2016 primary switched from the party they were affiliated with in 2012. But many more former Democrats requested Republican ballots than vice-versa. Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted released the stats that showed that in total, 1.8 million Ohio voters joined or changed parties by voting last March. The GOP picked up almost a million new voters to its rolls in that primary, but 910,131 of those were previously unaffiliated. According to Husted’s data, 115,762 former Democratic voters swapped for Republican ballots. That’s not a million. We asked some political scientists for their opinions. "There's an old saying in the social sciences: don't mistake correlation with causality," said L. Marvin Overby, a political science professor at the University of Missouri. "I would be very surprised if the voter changes were motivated by a desire among Democrats to vote for Trump. It seems more plausible that they opted to identify as Republicans to vote in the GOP primary for (Ohio Gov. John) Kasich and against Trump, especially given that the Democratic presidential primary wasn't very competitive." Ohio’s donkeys-turned-elephants might have been reacting to Trump’s candidacy, agreed Michael C. Munger of Duke University, but it’s impossible to know for certain. "Trump did not even win Ohio. Kasich hammered him by 10 percentage points. It would be odd to think of them as Trump voters, then," Munger said. He concurred that it makes more sense that former Democrats crossed the aisle to cast votes against Trump. In that case, the phenomenon was due to Trump -- but not to his advantage. We reached out to Hewitt but did not receive a response by the time of this publication. Our ruling As part of an MSNBC panel, Hewitt said, "A million Democrats deserted (Howard Dean’s) party and joined my party because of Donald Trump in Ohio this year." Without polling the Dems-turned-GOP, it’s not possible to know exactly why they switched parties. But data from the secretary of state showed that 115,762 Republican ballots were cast by former Democrats. An impressive number -- but not a million.

pomt-10302	"Obama voted to raise taxes on people making just $42,000."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/08/john-mccain/obama-voted-for-budget-resolution-not-taxes-/	New political ads from John McCain accuse Barack Obama of raising taxes on the middle class. "Obama voted to raise taxes on people making just $42,000," an announcer says in a television ad. "He promises more taxes on small business, seniors, your life savings, your family." To support this statement, the McCain campaign points to two Obama votes on budget resolutions, one in March 2008 and another in June 2008. Problem is, neither of these votes actually raised taxes, nor were they expected to. Instead, the votes approved budget resolutions, which are blueprints for the federal budget. The resolutions set targets for the committees that write legislation on taxes and spending. Obama joined Democrats on what were largely party-line votes expressing the desire to roll back the Bush tax cuts in order to fund popular programs. The tax cuts would have been rescinded on people making about $42,000 and higher. The McCain campaign is correct that Obama voted for the measures, which expressed approval for tax increases. But as we have pointed out in other stories, it's inaccurate to suggest votes on non-binding budget resolutions, which don't have the force of law and don't include precise details on taxes or spending, are the same as votes on legislation that sets policy. The ad gives an overall false impression that Obama as president would favor tax increases for incomes of $42,000. He does not. Obama's tax proposals are crafted so that tax increases hit those couples $250,000 or more a year, or $200,000 for singles. He also proposes a $1,000 tax credit on income for working families ($500 for singles). Because the ad cherry-picks a vote that would not have directly changed the tax code, we find the statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-08-08T00:00:00	2008-08-08	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-13915	"For every extra year that a girl stays in secondary school, her chance of getting infected with HIV/AIDS decreases by half."	mostly true	/global-news/statements/2016/jun/24/tim-kaine/more-schooling-reduces-hiv-risk-how-much/	There are any number of arguments for boosting the education of girls in poorer nations. A person who knows more, regardless of gender, tends to earn more. The children of mothers with more education often do better themselves. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., added another item to the list. At a Senate hearing on June 15, 2016, Kaine said, "For every extra year that a girl stays in secondary school, her chance of getting infected with HIV/AIDS decreases by half." As it turns out, Kaine had the general thrust right, but he went too far with the exact numbers. Here’s what the research shows. Botswana gave the world a natural experiment in 1996 when it changed its education policy by adding an extra year — grade 10 — to basic education. Botswana kept good records that covered both who stayed in school and their HIV status in the years that followed. Nearly two decades later, social scientists hopped on all that data. Their 2015 article in the medical journal Lancet found that among girls, the lifetime risk of HIV infection dropped by about one-third -- not one-half. Kaine’s press office cited that Botswana study as the source behind his statement. Looking at some of the wording in the article, we can see why they might read it to say that the risk for women fell by half. But it didn’t. We talked to one of the main researchers, Jacob Bor at Boston University’s School of Public Health, to confirm that it was reduced by one-third. Here’s the key table from that article. We underlined the key numbers in red. Before the reform, women had a 32.3 percent risk of catching the HIV infection. After getting the extra year of school, that risk came down by 11.6 percentage points, or roughly one-third. We’d also note that Kaine’s statement also parted from the Botswana study in that he talked about "every extra year that a girl stays in secondary school," while the study only had data on a single extra year. To say that the risk fell for every extra year would go far beyond what the research shows. Still, Bor said Kaine has the right idea. "He’s qualitatively correct, but quantitatively a little bit off," Bor said. "Also, these results are local to the incredibly high HIV prevalence in Botswana and their education reform. If you just parachute-dropped a year of extra schooling in another country, it’s not so clear you’d see the same result." Two studies out of Uganda also give support to Kaine’s broad concept, if not his actual numbers. Two Harvard researchers reported that between 1990 and 1995, HIV rates fell by about 13 percentage points. During that time, Uganda moved to keep children in school longer. The study said the driving factor was women delayed having sex. "(Education) policy can explain between one-sixth and one-half of this overall decline," the authors wrote in their 2013 article. That is a wide range, but it still shows movement in the direction that Kaine described. About a decade earlier, Damien de Walque, now at the World Bank, looked at 15 villages in Uganda. He and his colleagues found that "for girls born after 1970, one additional year of education reduced HIV incidence, that is the risk of getting infected with HIV/AIDS, by 21 percent," de Walque told us. That was for primary school, not secondary. "Sen. Kaine’s statement is largely correct that the more additional years of education a girl receives, the less likely it is that she will be infected with HIV," de Walque said. Our ruling Kaine said that a woman’s risk of HIV infection fell by half for every extra year of secondary school. That statement goes too far in a couple of ways. The biggest decline in risk that any study found with any precision was about one-third. That’s substantial, but it isn’t half. And Kaine erred in saying that the effect would come with each additional year, when the underlying Botswana study only looked at a single extra year. But in broad terms, leading researchers in the field gave Kaine points for getting the general point correct. More education has an appreciable impact in reducing a woman’s risk of contracting HIV.

pomt-10268	While in the Illinois Senate, Barack Obama passed "tax cuts for hard-working families."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/25/michelle-obama/obama-sponsored-earned-income-tax-credit/	Michelle Obama spoke at the Democratic National Convention in Denver on Aug. 25, 2008, dwelling largely on a personal portrait of her home life with Barack Obama and her upbringing in a working-class family on Chicago's South Side. She concluded her speech with a call to civic duty. "I believe that each of us — no matter what our age or background or walk of life — each of us has something to contribute to the life of this nation. It's a belief Barack shares — a belief at the heart of his life's work. ... "It's what he did in the Illinois Senate, moving people from welfare to jobs, passing tax cuts for hard-working families, and making sure women get equal pay for equal work." Here, we'll look at a claim we checked previously , that Obama won "tax cuts for hard-working families." In 2000, the Illinois legislature created a state earned income tax credit, based on the federal earned income tax program, which is a tax credit for low-income working individuals and families. The program is meant "to offset the burden of Social Security taxes and to provide an incentive to work," according to the Internal Revenue Service. In the federal version, when the tax credit exceeds the amount of taxes owed, it results in a tax refund to those who qualify. In the Illinois bill that Obama co-sponsored, state taxes can go to zero, but there is no additional refund. In the 2000 legislation, the legislative record shows that Obama was one of more than 40 senators who co-sponsored the bill, with most of them signing up for it on the same day. But the bill had a sunset clause, and when it came time to renew it in 2003, Obama filed the bill and was its chief sponsor. Another 20 senators signed on to co-sponsor it. Rather than renewing it for another few years, the Obama bill made the state earned income tax credit permanent, and it allowed for a refund if state funds were available. The record shows Obama was a minor co-sponsor in cutting taxes in 2000 and was the leader in the state Senate in 2003 in making the tax credits permanent. It takes more than one person to pass a bill, and although he played a significant role in making the tax credits permanent, the record on Obama's statement supports only a Mostly True.

pomt-13668	Says "Marco Rubio didn’t show up" for a vote on his own bill on sanctions against Hezbollah.	mostly false	/florida/statements/2016/aug/04/patrick-murphy/patrick-murphy-ad-misleads-about-marco-rubio-missi/	U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy, who hopes to win the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate seat currently held by Republican Marco Rubio, has frequently attacked Rubio’s absence from many of the chamber’s votes when Rubio was running for president in 2015 and 2016. Murphy hammered away at this theme in an ad released Aug. 1, 2016. The ad starts with a narrator asking, "Marco Rubio, how can you protect us when you fail to show up for work?" The ad then excerpts a pro-Rubio ad that boasted,"Rubio wrote the toughest sanctions on Hezbollah ever passed." (Hezbollah is an Islamist group based in Lebanon and designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department since 1997.) Then, the narrator of the Murphy ad counters, "Wait a second, Marco Rubio didn’t show up for that vote. Missed more votes than anyone in the entire U.S. Senate last year." In March, we rated Mostly True the claim that Rubio "has the No. 1 absentee record" in the Senate. But is Murphy correct that "Marco Rubio didn’t show up" for a vote on his own bill to tighten sanctions against Hezbollah? It’s a little complicated. Let’s recap what happened. The floor action The Rubio camp argues that Murphy is constructing a straw man, since there wasn’t a formal "vote" on the Hezbollah sanctions bill. Rather, it passed by unanimous consent -- a procedural mechanism in which senators are given an opportunity in advance to object to a bill or other action. Under unanimous consent, if no advance objections are made, then the measure proceeds to the floor. At a prearranged time, a senator requests unanimous consent to consider the bill passed, and -- if the presiding officer hears no objection from senators in the chamber -- so orders. No individual votes are recorded and no other senators need to be present. The bill in question was passed by unanimous consent on Nov. 17, 2015. (It was eventually signed by President Barack Obama and became law.) We turned to the C-SPAN archives and the Congressional Record to nail down exactly what happened that day. At 6:30 p.m., the Senate was in the aftermath of a vote. Most senators appeared to have left the floor, as can be seen in this screenshot. A few minutes later, Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., was given the floor to call for consideration of H.R. 2297, The Hezbollah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015. Technically, he was there to ask that an existing bill be renamed and filled with newly agreed-upon text addressing the Hezbollah sanctions. Daines said he was seeking unanimous consent that the measure be "agreed to ... as amended" and "passed." Here’s a screenshot of Daines making that request. Following what is usually a carefully choreographed procedure, the presiding officer, Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., said, "Without objection, it is so ordered." Here’s Gardner: And the deed was done. What experts say Experts in Senate procedure said it’s misleading for Murphy to say that Rubio "didn’t show up" for the vote on his bill, because it was not a formal vote in which all senators were supposed to be present so their individual votes could be recorded. In this case, there appear to be only a handful of senators in the chamber at the time -- Daines, Gardner and Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., who was waiting for his turn to deliver a floor speech. The main chance for Rubio -- or any other senator -- to weigh in on the measure would have been as the unanimous consent proposal was being circulated before the bill reached the floor. In fact, under the kinds of Senate attendance tallies that Murphy cited elsewhere in the ad, a senator’s absence from a unanimous consent vote would not even count as an absence, experts said. "It's not unusual for the Senate to pass bills by unanimous consent," said Sarah A. Binder, a political scientist at George Washington University. "Given the Senate's byzantine floor rules and senators' schedules, the Senate relies on voice votes to get non-controversial measures passed. So Sen. Rubio's absence, even for a bill that he sponsored, strikes me as within the norm of Senate practice. The harder work of most bills is getting a bill to the floor and securing bicameral and presidential agreement." Binder added that "a challenger's campaign is certainly on the mark to challenge an incumbent's voting participation, but I'd be hesitant to highlight a bill that passed (this way) as the best evidence of low attendance." Steven S. Smith, a political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis, also called the assertion in Murphy’s ad "misleading" and added that none of the Senate cosponsors -- a mix of Democrats and Republicans -- were on the floor, either. When we contacted the Murphy campaign, spokeswoman Galia Slayen said that Rubio "is campaigning on passing a bill, but when that bill passed, he was not present." The campaign also noted that Rubio was fundraising on the day of the vote, which is supported by contemporary coverage in the Tampa Bay Times. Our ruling Murphy’s ad said that Rubio "didn’t show up" for a vote on his own bill on sanctions against Hezbollah. Some may perceive it as embarrassing for Rubio to have missed that moment on the floor to chase donors instead, but on the substance, Murphy’s assertion is distinctly misleading. The bill in question passed under unanimous consent, a commonly used Senate procedure in which individual senators’ votes are not tallied, and in which most senators -- even bill sponsors and co-sponsors -- are not typically in the chamber. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-13505	Says Hillary Clinton "wants to increase Syrian refugees to this country by 550 percent."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/04/mike-pence/mike-pence-cites-clinton-support-more-syrian-refug/	It’s an old political motto: A good offense is good defense. So to defend Donald Trump’s policies on immigration, vice presidential nominee Mike Pence went on the attack against Hillary Clinton’s policies. On NBC’s Meet the Press, moderator Chuck Todd asked Pence about Trump’s policies to ban Muslims from entering the United States. In recent weeks, Trump has said he would ban Muslims from countries with terrorist activity. When Todd pressed Pence about what countries those would be, Pence changed the subject to Clinton’s Syria policy. "Well, Hillary Clinton wants to increase Syrian refugees to this country by 550 percent," Pence said. "Donald Trump and I believe that we should suspend the Syrian refugee program." Pence added that their preferred policy is to work with Arab countries to establish safe zones closer to Syria. We wanted to look at Pence’s claim that Clinton’s policy is for 550 percent increase. That number is accurate for now. Syrian refugees by the numbers The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is the international agency that tracks and promotes refugee resettlement around the world. Its current count of people who have fled the civil war in Syria, which started in 2011, is 4.8 million. Many of those 4.8 million refugees are in neighboring countries such as Turkey, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. Due to overcrowding and the large number of overall refugees, the UN has called on other countries around the world to accept more Syrians for resettlement. President Barack Obama agreed on behalf of the United States to accept 10,000 refugees for fiscal year 2016. The number was reached on Aug. 29, 2016, and the UN hailed the milestone in a press release. "We thank the communities in the United States that have kept their doors open and also our civil society partners for their tireless humanitarian efforts. Much more needs to be done for Syrian refugees and for the global crisis that has seen more people flee persecution than at any time ever recorded," said Shelly Pitterman, UNHCR regional representative in the United States. The agency reported that around 478,000 Syrians are in need of resettlement, and Syrians make up about 40 percent of all refugees worldwide who need resettlement. In September 2015, Clinton had called the 10,000-figure for the United States a good start but had urged an increase up to 65,000. Clinton said then the United States should be "looking to really emphasize some of those who are most vulnerable, a lot of the persecuted religious minorities, including Christians, and some who have been brutalized, like the Yazidi women." That 65,000-figure is a 550 percent increase from the 10,000 that Obama supported. It’s important to note, however, that those numbers applied to fiscal year 2016, which ends by Oct. 1, 2016. Clinton has not discussed numbers for the next fiscal year. So it’s possible that 550 percent number may soon be out of date. We should also note that there is a screening process for refugees. The UN identifies and screens refugees before they are referred to a country for resettlement. U.S. security agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security, then conduct multiple security checks. Our ruling Pence pointed to a real policy distinction between the Republican and Democratic presidential nominees when he said that Clinton "wants to increase Syrian refugees to this country by 550 percent." Trump is opposed to refugee settlement, while Clinton supports it, and at a greater number than Obama’s current policy. Clinton supported allowing in 65,000 refugees when Obama supported a 10,000 figure. (The refugees would be screened.) That’s a 550 percent increase. The UN has determined that about 478,000 Syrian refugees are in need of resettlement. The statement is accurate and we rate it True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f5c92c56-bd8d-4a39-b2c5-58a7fed58505	None	Mike Pence	None	None	None	2016-09-04T17:56:59	2016-09-04	['Syria']
pomt-02830	"You've got more people wanting to go moose hunting in New Hampshire than want Obamacare."	half-true	/new-hampshire/statements/2013/nov/22/mike-huckabee/mike-huckabee-says-more-people-want-hunt-moose-new/	With dismal early enrollment numbers, the new federal health insurance marketplace that went live in October 2013 has been derided by critics, including former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. Speaking on his radio program, The Mike Huckabee Show, on Nov. 18, 2013, the one-time Republican presidential candidate argued that a staggeringly low number of Americans are interested in buying coverage under Obamacare. For example, in New Hampshire, Huckabee said, only 269 people enrolled in a health insurance plan through the new federal health insurance exchange. "To compare that, 281 people in New Hampshire were issued permits to hunt moose," Huckabee said. "So I mean, the fact is, you've got more people wanting to go moose hunting in New Hampshire than want Obamacare." Huckabee tried to drive home his point a little further, asking, "Which is more likely to help you survive the winter in New Hampshire, a freezer full of moose meat or health insurance that your doctor won’t even accept?" The moose reference was so catchy that variations of the claim were made on several other talk radio shows around the same time, and they and took off across Facebook and Twitter as well. Huckabee’s radio show is broadcast on more than 200 radio stations in 44 states. We reached out to Huckabee, who offered little explanation. "It was a radio story I did based on report from NH that more people had applied for moose hunting permits than signed up for Obamacare," he said through a staffer. We wondered if it was true that more people in the state want to bag a moose than want to buy health insurance under Obamacare. First, the numbers. Huckabee is correct that New Hampshire’s Fish and Game Department issued 281 permits to moose hunters this year. But the number who wanted to go moose hunting was higher. Wildlife officials received more than 13,000 applications from people wanting to go moose hunting this year, and the state held a lottery to determine who got the permits. Not all of those applications were from New Hampshire residents, but there were about 13,000 people "wanting to go moose hunting in New Hampshire." Meanwhile, as of Nov. 2, 2013, only 269 people in New Hampshire had enrolled in a new health insurance plan. That’s fewer than the number of permits to hunt moose in New Hampshire, and far fewer than the number of applications to hunt moose in New Hampshire. But is that number greater than the amount of people in New Hampshire who "want Obamacare?" This is where things get tricky, because there’s no way to know how many people in New Hampshire want insurance coverage through the federal marketplace. By asserting that only 269 people in the state want a health care plan through the federal marketplace, Huckabee implies that everyone who wanted to sign up for coverage under Obamacare has already done so. There are a few reasons why this probably isn’t the case. For starters, it’s possible that some people just haven’t gotten around to enrolling in a plan yet. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services predicted the pace of enrollment would initially be slow when the marketplace opened in October 2013. DHHS is anticipating peaks in December -- when the deadline falls to apply for coverage beginning Jan. 1, 2014 -- and March, when the open enrollment period is scheduled to end. It’s also true that lingering technical problems with the federal health care website prevented some people in New Hampshire from signing up. New Hampshire engaged in a partnership with the federal government to operate its insurance exchange. That means residents who want to buy coverage online must navigate through healthcare.gov, the troubled website that was established to support the president’s health reform law. And while only 269 New Hampshire residents have enrolled in a new health care plan through the federal marketplace, a far greater number of individuals were listed as having completed applications. Some 7,817 people from New Hampshire were named on those applications. Very few of them enrolled in a plan, but it can be argued that every individual named on an application showed some level of interest in buying coverage under Obamacare. Many, if not most of these people, can reasonably be assumed to want Obamacare. We also have to consider the possibility that enrollment numbers increased during the month of November 2013. Huckabee cited data that reflects only the enrollment numbers up to Nov. 2, 2013. Sixteen days transpired between then and Nov. 18, 2013, when Huckabee made his claim. On that same day, the New York Times reported that enrollment through the federal health insurance marketplace had increased from less than 27,000 people nationwide during October to about 50,000 by mid-November. The new group of customers may include people from New Hampshire. The Department of Health and Human Services isn’t expected to release new enrollment figures until mid-December, making it impossible for now to gauge exactly how many additional people in New Hampshire have signed up. Our ruling Huckabee said that there are "more people wanting to go moose hunting in New Hampshire than want Obamacare." His statement is grounded in some verifiable data, but his wording choice casts doubt on the accuracy of the statement. On the one hand, at least 13,000 people applied to go moose hunting in New Hampshire this year, which is far more than the 269 who bought insurance through the new marketplace during the first month it was operational. However, it’s unlikely that only 269 people in New Hampshire want Obamacare. For starters, 7,817 New Hampshire residents were named on applications as potential enrollees. And others were likely scared away by the federal website’s technical problems, and the pace of enrollment was always expected to increase as deadlines neared. The bottom line is that no one can truly know how many people in New Hampshire "want Obamacare" at this early stage of enrollment. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-10152	Sen. McCain's tax plan provides "virtually nothing to the middle class."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/02/joe-biden/mccains-tax-plan-doesnt-ignore-middle-class/	In the much-anticipated vice presidential debate, Sen. Joe Biden and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin sparred over distribution of the tax burden under the tax plans proposed by the top of their tickets. Biden picked up a refrain hammered by his running mate, Sen. Barack Obama, saying that Obama’s plan would provide more relief for the middle class. Biden would have been on solid footing had he stopped there, but he went one step further, claiming Sen. John McCain’s plan has nothing for the middle class. "The economic engine of America is middle class," Biden said. "It’s the people listening to this broadcast. When you do well, America does well. Even the wealthy do well. This is not punitive. John wants to add $300-million, billion in new tax cuts per year for corporate America and the very wealthy while giving virtually nothing to the middle class. We have a different value set. The middle class is the economic engine. It’s fair. They deserve the tax breaks, not the superwealthy who are doing pretty well. They don’t need any more tax breaks." Though independent analyses of the income tax provisions have generally concluded McCain’s plan would most benefit wealthy Americans, his plan does have provisions that would help individuals with lower household incomes. Chief among these is a proposed increase to the exemption taxpayers may claim for each dependent — currently $3,500 — by $500 each year beginning in 2010 until it would reach $7,000 in 2016, after which it would be indexed for inflation. Under the McCain plan, married couples that file a joint return reporting adjusted gross income of $50,000 or less would be eligible for the $7,000 exemption immediately. So clearly, middle- and lower-income households with children would receive above-average tax cuts. McCain also would raise and index for inflation the threshold for the alternative minimum tax, or AMT, a separate income tax that was intended to ensure that people did not use loopholes to avoid paying taxes but that has been ensnaring more and more middle-income Americans. Congress in recent years has extended the AMT exemption for a year or two at a time so that large numbers of taxpayers don’t become subject to the tax. Congress is almost certain to enact another temporary "patch" covering the 2008 tax year. But McCain would permanently extend the AMT exemption, index it for inflation and allow individuals to claim personal nonrefundable credits against the AMT. How much this would help middle-class families largely depends on how you define middle class. The Tax Policy Center says it would primarily benefit more affluent households in the 80th to 95th percentile of income — those earning between $111,645 and $226,918 in 2008 dollars, were McCain’s plan to be fully phased in next year. Still, households with more modest means would not be subjected to the AMT under McCain’s proposal. McCain would also extend President Bush’s 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, currently set to expire at the end of 2010. Those cuts collectively reduced top marginal tax rates on individuals’ incomes, cut the rates on capital gains and dividends, expanded the child tax credit and reduced taxes on married couples compared to singles. The Tax Policy Center says McCain’s policy proposals collectively would reduce the tax exposure of 60 percent of all American households, though fewer than half of those making between $18,981 and $37,595. But for the middle 20 percent of taxpayers — people making between $37,595 and $66,354 — here’s how the Tax Policy Center sees the respective tax plans shake out: Under McCain’s plan, their tax bill would go down by $325 in 2009, on average, and $1,118 under Obama’s plan. If you look down the road to 2012, those in the middle quintile would see tax cuts of $1,441 under McCain’s plan and $2,197 under Obama’s. The analysis backs up Obama’s broad contention that McCain’s tax policy is weighted to give the largest benefit to higher-income taxpayers. However, it’s wrong to say McCain’s plan would provide no relief to middle-class Americans. Its more generous exemption for dependents and lower tax rates would cut across income levels and reduce or eliminate many taxpayers’ AMT exposure. For this reason, we rule the Biden’s comment Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Joe Biden	None	None	None	2008-10-02T00:00:00	2008-10-02	['None']
pomt-08399	"There are 100 members of the U.S. Senate. Fifty-seven of them, including Russ Feingold, are lawyers. There are zero manufacturers and one accountant."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/22/ron-johnson/ron-johnson-says-there-are-57-lawyers-including-ru/	Members of Congress have worked all sorts of interesting jobs before entering politics: casino dealer, meat cutter, major-league pitcher, riverboat captain, Navy battle group commander, toll booth collector, even coroner. But the most common background is law, as Republican Senate hopeful Ron Johnson is quick to point out. Johnson, who is facing lawyer and Democratic U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold, made the point most directly in a recent TV ad. In it, he noted on a whiteboard that 57 of 100 members of the Senate are lawyers. "That would be fine if we had a lawsuit to settle," Johnson went on to say in the ad, "but we have an economy to fix. There are zero manufacturers and one accountant. It’s no wonder we’re losing jobs and piling up debt. I’m not a politician. I’m an accountant and a manufacturer. I know how to balance a budget, and I do know how to create jobs. Now that’s something we could really use." So, is the Senate a majority-lawyer body? And, importantly, is it bereft of people with a business background, as the ad implies? In making his claim, Johnson, who runs a 100-employee plastics manufacturing plant, cites a 2010 Congressional Research Service paper that shows 57 members of the Senate graduated from law school. Of course, having a law degree does not mean you were a practicing attorney before entering politics, as Feingold was for six years before and after he became a state lawmaker in 1982. Indeed, our own review of 100 Senate biographies -- yes, we read them all -- found some went right into public service or other careers out of law school. Case in point: Democrat Charles Schumer of New York, whose official biography says he ran for state Assembly right out of Harvard Law School in 1974. An earlier study by Congressional Quarterly, completed in 2008 before three changes to the Senate, showed law as the top occupation of senators (54 of them at the time), followed by public service (32) and business (26). To make his point, Johnson focuses narrowly on manufacturing and accountants -- two key points on his own résumé. But PolitiFact Wisconsin found a half-dozen senators who listed experience building and running a company, including Wisconsin’s Herb Kohl, who presided over the Kohl’s grocery and department store chain. More than 20 have at least some business background. When it comes strictly to manufacturers and accountants, Johnson’s claim is a little off. If Johnson continues at the helm of Pacur, his Oshkosh-based company, he may be the only active manufacturer. But Sen. Richard Lugar, Republican from Indiana, lists "manufacturing company executive" as one of his careers, according to Congressional Quarterly. His Senate website says he helped manage the family's food machinery manufacturing business in Indianapolis with his brother Tom. That was a long time ago -- before his public career began in the late 1960s. Meanwhile, Sen. Tom Coburn, Republican from Oklahoma, is best known as a doctor, but in the 1970s he "served as manufacturing manager at the Ophthalmic Division of Coburn Optical Industries in Colonial Heights, Virginia," according to his bio. Under his leadership, the Virginia division of Coburn Optical grew from 13 employees to more than 350 and captured 35 percent of the U.S. market, the bio says. Johnson says there’s only one accountant in the Senate, but he’s off by one on that -- at least by education. He correctly cites Mike Enzi, Republican of Wyoming, who was an accountant for an oil drilling company, according to his Senate bio. But Coburn was also educated as an accountant. So, how does this all tally out? In touting his background, Republican Ron Johnson says there are 57 lawyers, one accountant and no manufacturers in the U.S. Senate. He is correct that legal beagles -- not business people -- dominate the body, though some are lawyers by education, not trade. While Johnson’s bean-counting skills were not at their sharpest -- at least two members have a manufacturing background and two an accounting background -- his central point is on the money. We rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Ron Johnson	None	None	None	2010-10-22T09:01:00	2010-09-28	['Russ_Feingold', 'United_States']
pomt-09072	"Four years as a congressman, he [U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson] never talked about MARTA."	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2010/jun/27/vernon-jones/congressman-quiet-marta-jones-says/	The population growth spurt in southeast DeKalb County over the past two decades has resulted in a grim reality: Traffic can be torture. In recent years, elected officials have talked about extending the region's rail service, MARTA, farther east in DeKalb to make commuting easier for area residents. Vernon Jones, a Democrat and former DeKalb County CEO who is running for Congress to represent the area, has complained incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson has not done enough to help MARTA since the congressman went to Washington in 2007. Here's one verbal volley by Jones from a June 3 candidate forum in southeast Atlanta: "Four years as a congressman, he [Johnson] never talked about MARTA." Never? Isn't that a little bit extreme? "You can't find anything where Hank has talked about MARTA," Jones said in a telephone interview last week. Well, PolitiFact Georgia decided to do a little exploring. A spokesman for Johnson, who represents Georgia's 4th Congressional District, sent PolitiFact Georgia a letter dated July 10, 2009, from the congressman to U.S. Rep. John Olver. Olver is a Democrat from Massachusetts who is chair of the House Appropriations subcommittee on transportation and other issues. Johnson asked for $9 million to help MARTA buy clean-fuel buses. Johnson also requested money for MARTA's I-20 East Transit Corridor and Clifton Corridor studies. "How much did [Johnson] get?" asked Jones. Johnson testified before Olver's committee on April 15, making another pitch for the I-20 rail study. He also asked the committee for $12 million to help MARTA buy new buses, to repair others and for security cameras. "They're pretty inaccurate and unfair," Johnson's spokesman, Andy Phelan, said of Jones' claims. Jones and Johnson, most DeKalb politicos know, worked together on the County Commission. Jones was DeKalb's chief executive officer from 2001 to 2008. Johnson was a county commissioner from 2001 to 2006, representing much of southeast DeKalb. Since 2009, Johnson has been a co-sponsor of four separate pieces of federal legislation that obtained $5.725 million for MARTA, agency records show. The bulk of that money, $4 million, was for the acquisition of clean-fuel buses. Jones argued that Johnson has been a bit player in these efforts to get money for MARTA. "Hank is the least senior member [of the lawmakers who co-sponsored the legislation]," Jones said. "You cannot say he brought that money back [to Georgia]." Jones contends that Johnson did not get serious about his interest in MARTA until Jones began talking about the transit system on the campaign trail. Johnson was appointed earlier this year to the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Shortly afterward, Johnson and his wife took a first-class trip on MARTA with the agency's CEO as his guide through the district. The fact remains that Johnson has talked about MARTA. The support of veteran congressmen such as Sens. Saxby Chambliss and Johnny Isakson and Rep. John Lewis likely played a greater factor in getting the $5.7 million, but Johnson was a co-sponsor.

pomt-10294	"John McCain's top foreign policy adviser lobbied for... the Republic of Georgia, and McCain has mirrored the position advocated by the government."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/13/barack-obama/mccains-on-georgias-side-so-is-obama/	Sen. Barack Obama has battered Sen. John McCain throughout the campaign for his ties to Washington lobbyists, arguing that McCain's lobbyist allies have influenced his policy positions. After Russia invaded Georgia on Aug. 8, Obama spokesman Hari Sevugan let loose another such accusation: "John McCain's top foreign policy adviser lobbied for and has a vested interest in the Republic of Georgia, and McCain has mirrored the position advocated by the government." McCain's top foreign policy adviser, Randy Scheunemann, has lobbied for Georgia. Scheunemann, a former national security adviser to former Senate Majority Leaders Trent Lott of Mississippi and Bob Dole of Kansas in the 1990s, signed a March 2004 contract — on file at the Justice Department's Foreign Agents Registration Act office — indicating that Scheunemann and his firm, Orion Strategies, would assist Georgia in gaining membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in exchange for $150,000 for a year's work. That goal has yet to be achieved — Russia vehemently opposes Georgia's inclusion — so Georgia has renewed the contract several times, most recently in May of this year, at a cost of $200,000 through the end of 2008. Scheunemann took a leave of absence from Orion Strategies earlier this year but it's probably fair to say that he remains invested in his firm, a two-person shop he started in 2001 with Mike Mitchell, a former aide to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, and to which he could easily return if McCain loses the presidency. Mitchell continues to handle the Georgia account. It's clear, too, that McCain has "mirrored the position advocated by the government" of Georgia, at least so far. McCain sponsored a nonbinding resolution that the Senate passed unanimously in December 2005 urging the United States to increase its efforts in support of the peaceful reincorporation of South Ossetia into Georgia. The resolution also commended the government of Georgia for devising a peace plan to "control peacefully and re-establish authority" in the separatist region. What's cloudier, indeed, is whether McCain's view of the Russian invasion differs substantially from Obama's. Reporters tried to pick apart the candidates' initial statements after Russian forces moved into Georgia on Aug. 8. A New York Times report, for example, argued that McCain's first statement was "immediate and tough," since McCain's statement blamed Russia for crossing an "internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of Georgia" while demanding that Russia "unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces." That mirrored what Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili had said Aug. 9, when he said Russia had launched a full-scale invasion and offered an immediate cease-fire. Obama, the New York Times said, "trod more carefully," not blaming Russia at first. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said that his country had been provoked by Georgia's assault on South Ossetia, an autonomous, ethnically Russian region of Georgia. But as Russia continued its invasion into Georgian territory on Aug. 11, Obama moved toward McCain's position. "No matter how this conflict started, Russia has escalated it well beyond the dispute over South Ossetia and invaded another country," he said. "There is no possible justification for these attacks." McCain and Obama have both now issued statements supporting Georgia's entry into NATO. There's no evidence that Scheunemann's ties to Georgia have influenced McCain's position, but it is correct to say McCain has supported the view of the Georgia government. The Obama campaign's statement about Scheunemann and McCain is True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-08-13T00:00:00	2008-08-09	['John_McCain']
pomt-03691	Congress has spent 66 of the first 100 days of this term in recess.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2013/apr/22/john-barrow/congress-away-too-often-georgia-lawmaker-says/	Congress has received record-low approval ratings in recent years, thanks largely to the oceanlike divide on issues such as federal spending, taxes and gun control. One Georgia congressman offered another reason for public scorn. "On January 3rd, a new Congress convened with a mandate from voters all across this country to work together. Unfortunately, very little has changed. Too many in Congress are unwilling to compromise and do what’s necessary to get this country moving," said John Barrow, a Democratic House member from Augusta. "Sixty-six out of the first 100 days of this Congress have been spent in recess. That’s shameful. While I'd much rather be in Georgia meeting with folks across the 12th District, we have a lot of work to do in Washington." Barrow, who’s reportedly entertaining a run for the U.S. Senate, went on to say in the letter that he hasn’t been letting the grass grow under his feet during these many absences. "During those 66 days of recess, I’ve been busy meeting with folks all across the 12th District. I’ve visited with folks and held events in all 19 counties of the 12th Congressional District," Barrow said. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether Barrow’s claim about Congress being in recess an average of two out of every three days was accurate, or is he trying to score some political points at the expense of his colleagues. Barrow spokesman RIchard Carbo forwarded us a calendar prepared by the staff of one of the most influential Democrats in the House of Representatives, Steny Hoyer of Maryland. It notes in red each day Congress is scheduled to have votes this year. As Barrow wrote, the first day of the 113th Congress was Jan. 3, 2013. April 12 would have marked 100 calendar days since this Congress was convened. Hoyer’s calendar shows Congress held sessions to vote on 34 of those 100 days. We reviewed a Library of Congress calendar and found it had 41 days that Congress had been in session. Carbo explained that the Library of Congress calendar includes "pro forma" days, days when the House met for just a few minutes to conduct procedural matters. "There are lots of 10-minute sessions where there is no one around," said Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar with the American Enterprise Institute who has done extensive research on the machinations of Congress. Carbo also asserted "pro forma" sessions are held by the House’s Republican leadership to prevent President Barack Obama, a Democrat, from making appointments while Congress is in recess. The Congressional Record website shows that the House met for two to five minutes all of those days. The Senate, by our review of the Congressional Record’s information, met 33 of the first 100 days it was in session. Hoyer’s calendar does not include Jan. 21, in which both chambers of Congress were in a special session for the president’s public inauguration. We wondered whether the number of days Congress was in session the first 100 days of 2013 was disproportionate to past years. PolitiFact Georgia went back 20 years, looking at each odd year since those were years a new Congress was sworn into office. This year was in the middle. Here is the Library of Congress breakdown, not excluding possible "pro forma" days: 1995: 58 days 2007: 49 days 2009: 48 days 2011: 46 days 2003: 42 days 2013: 41 days 2001: 35 days 2005: 33 days 1999: 33 days 1997: 33 days Donald Wolfensberger, who worked 28 years for several Republican members of Congress with an expertise in parliamentary rules, offered one reason for the seemingly low number of days this Congress has been in session. "New Congresses take time to get committees organized and then for them to start cranking out legislation. Slow starts are not unusual," said Wolfensberger, a senior scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington. Ornstein, a columnist who co-wrote a book called "The Broken Branch: How Congress Is Failing America and How to Get It Back on Track," said he has long pushed for a congressional schedule of three weeks in session and one week off. Ornstein had a few ideas why Congress, particularly the Republican-led House, is not interested in meeting much in Washington. "They have an adversarial relationship with (Obama) and less in common," Ornstein said. Ornstein offered another reason members of Congress, regardless of party affiliation, may want to spend less time in session: It’s tougher to raise the large sums of money now necessary to stay in office, and being in session takes time away from fundraising. To sum up, Barrow said Congress spent 66 of the first 100 days of the current session in recess. There were a few additional days the House was in session, albeit very, very short meetings. With that bit of context, we believe Barrow’s claim is Mostly True.	None	John Barrow	None	None	None	2013-04-22T06:00:00	2013-04-05	['None']
pomt-15220	"The United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2015/aug/10/jim-webb/webb-says-us-has-worlds-highest-incarceration-rate/	There are too many people in prisons, says former U.S. Sen. Jim Webb, who’s seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. "The United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world," Webb says on his campaign website. Webb often made the same claim while representing Virginia in the U.S. Senate from 2007-2013, and he introduced unsuccessful legislation that would have set up a bipartisan commission to study prison and sentencing reform. He’s said alternatives to prison should be set up for nonviolent criminals such as drug offenders. Last December, we gave a True rating to Webb’s statement that the U.S. has 25 percent of the known global prison population despite having only 5 percent of the world population. This time, we’ll look into his claim that the U.S. has the highest incarceration rate on the planet. The most comprehensive and widely-cited examination of the world’s prison population comes from the International Centre for Prison Studies at the University of London, which looks at prison populations in more than 200 countries and territories. In a 2013 report, the group said the U.S. prison population rate of 716 inmates per 100,000 people was No. 1 in the world. But that’s not the end of the story. The center updates its figures monthly. The latest figures on the center’s web site show the U.S. has 698 prisoners per 100,000. That’s the second highest in the world. Before reading further, guess who’s No. 1 ... It’s the island nation of Seychelles in the Indian Ocean near Africa. It has a population of 92,000, including 735 living behind bars. That translates to an incarceration rate of 799 per 100,000 people. Experts have told PolitiFact National that Seychelles’ tiny population makes its incarceration rate difficult to compare to that of the United States, which has nearly 320 million people. After all, a modest increase of prisoners by U.S. standards, say 100, would dramatically spike the Seychelle’s rate. There’s a big caveat with the center’s rankings. The group does not have inmate tallies for several countries, including North Korea, which is widely believed to have a large prison population. Amnesty International estimated in 2011 that the reclusive nation had 200,000 prisoners. That would equate to a world-leading incarceration rate of 813 per 100,000. Among industrialized nations tracked by the center, the U.S. incarceration rate of 698 per 100,000 is in a stratosphere by itself. Russia ranks second at 455 per 100,000. There’s no doubt that the U.S. prison population has soared during the last 40 years. Department of Justice figures show the nation’s incarceration rate held steady at about 110 per 100,000 from 1925 to 1975. Experts have pointed to many reasons for more recent surge, including tougher sentencing laws and a zeal to crack down on illegal drugs. Our ruling Webb said the U.S. has the highest incarceration rate in the world. The latest figures from the most comprehensive source show the U.S. is No. 2, behind Seychelles. There are data gaps for some countries, including such as North Korea whose prison figures can’t be verified but are estimated to be very high. That leaves the possibility that the U.S. could fall further down the list. It’s clear that the U.S. has one of the very highest incarceration rates in the world, but Webb’s claim that it’s the top doesn’t quite check out. We rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-05211	Says Democratic runoff opponent Grady Yarbrough twice previously ran statewide as a Republican.	true	/texas/statements/2012/jun/08/paul-sadler/paul-sadler-says-grady-yarbrough-ran-twice-statewi/	Paul Sadler, a former legislator who is in a July 2012 runoff for the Democratic Party U.S. Senate nomination, told the Hispanic Caucus at the Texas Democratic Party state convention in Houston: "I’m running against a gentleman from San Antonio that ran as a Republican statewide twice." Sadler was referring to Grady Yarbrough, a retired schoolteacher who made the July 31 runoff in the May primary by finishing second to Sadler, who carried 35 percent to Yarbrough’s 26 percent. And has Yarbrough run previously for statewide office -- as a Republican? That’s so, according to a June 1, 2012, Houston Chronicle news article, which says this year Yarbrough is making his fourth statewide race. The story says he sought the 1986 and 1990 Republican nominations for state land commissioner and the 1994 Democratic nomination for state treasurer. According to election results posted online by the state, Yarbrough lost the 1994 Democratic primary for state treasurer to incumbent Martha Whitehead. The Texas Secretary of State’s office does not post the 1990 and 1986 primary results online, so we looked via the Nexis service for old news accounts mentioning Yarbrough’s runs as a Republican. According to a February 20, 1994, Dallas Morning News news article, Yarbrough, then a Tyler high school teacher, had run in 1986 and 1990 as a Republican for state land commissioner, losing runoffs both years. "This year," the Morning News story says, "he not only changed his political affiliation but also the spelling of his name, listing himself in his application for a place on the Democratic primary ballot as ‘Grady Yarborough.’" The story quotes Yarbrough as saying he made the name change for the ballot to counter allegations made by his opponent in the 1990 land commissioner's race that he was simply running then because "Yarbrough" prompted sympathetic sentiment, a reference to Ralph Yarborough, who had been one of the state’s U.S. senators. According to a June 7, 1986, Associated Press news story, Yarbrough lost the 1986 Republican runoff to M.D. Anderson, Jr., who had fended off criticism that he was trying to capitalize on his name matching the name of the well-known cancer treatment center. Finally, we reached Yarbrough, who confirmed his past Republican runs, saying of Sadler: "He’s trying to use a smear campaign, huh?" In a telephone interview, Yarbrough said he was invited by a Tyler friend to help the Republican Party in about 1984 and volunteered to help Republican Bill Clements make his successful last run for governor in 1986. Yarbrough said he left the GOP after the party’s chairman in 1990 refused to condemn another candidate for the party's land commissioner nomination who had offended Yarbrough by saying that his name was adapted from slave holders. The opponent, Yarbrough told us, "should not have brought that up." Yarbrough said he became a Democrat after the 1990 race because he felt he was no longer welcome in the Republican Party. We rate Sadler’s statement as True.	None	Paul Sadler	None	None	None	2012-06-08T16:25:37	2012-06-08	['Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-09586	"With a stroke of a pen, the (U.S. Supreme Court) decided to overrule the 100-year-old ban on corporate expenditures."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/22/charles-schumer/campaign-finance-ruling-united-citizens-historical/	It's clear that the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling on campaign finance reform, allowing corporations to spend as much as they like on their own political ads, marked a major reversal of current campaign law. But according to leading Democrats, the ruling went much further than overturning recent law. "With a stroke of a pen, the court decided to overrule the 100-year-old ban on corporate expenditures and override the will of millions of Americans who want their voices heard in our democracy," said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. Other Democrats echoed similar sentiments, that the Supreme Court has overruled more than a century of established law. This more-than-100-years talk confused us. We thought the Supreme Court ruling hinged on a recent campaign finance law, sponsored by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., more formally referred to as the Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act of 2002 -- and clearly less than 100 years old. So we decided to look into Schumer's statement. But first, a little bit more about the case, which was kicked off by Hillary: The Movie, a documentary film that portrays Clinton as deceitful, ideological and power-hungry. During the 2008 presidential campaign, a group called Citizens United wanted to promote the movie in the days leading up the election. But the Federal Election Commission said they couldn't do that; the 2002 campaign finance law banned corporations from "electioneering" -- running ads or messages that mentioned a specific candiate -- during the 30 days before a primary and 60 days before an election. The FEC said Citizens United could not promote the movie without violating the law. The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, not only threw out the time limits for electioneering, but added that the federal government could not set limits on corporations spending whatever they wanted to promote their own political messages during campaigns. The ban violated free speech protections, the court said. So the ruling does go further than just ending the ban on electioneering. But how far back does it go? We asked Schumer's staff about the 100-year-old comment, and they pointed us toward a 1907 law called the Tillman Act. They cited the dissenting opinion issued this week, written by Justice John Paul Stevens, that said, "The majority’s approach to corporate electioneering marks a dramatic break from our past. Congress has placed special limitations on campaign spending by corporations ever since the passage of the Tillman Act in 1907." But as we dug deeper into the history of the Tillman Act, the picture got murky because of the difference between independent expenditures and direct contributions. An independent expenditure means money that corporations go out and spend on their own to portray a particular candidate as unfit for office, or on an issue. A direct contribution means a donation to a candidate's campaign, for the campaign to spend any way it likes. Corporations may not make direct contributions to federal campaigns from their own treasury; they have to create a separate political action committee, or PAC, for that. The recent ruling did nothing to change that ban. The Tillman Act said corporations could not "make a money contribution in connection with any election to any political office." Now, does this mean that independent expenditures are outlawed, or just direct contributions? We looked at several court opinions and legal articles, and everything we looked at suggested that back then, people weren't thinking of campaign contributions in those terms. And in 1947, Congress came back and passed another law, the Taft-Hartley Labor Act, banning corporations and unions from making independent expenditures. In fact, much of modern campaign finance laws dates to the post-Watergate period in the 1970s, when Congress passed the Federal Election Campaign Act and a series of amendments. That's when modern reporting requirements for campaigns were put into place, and the Federal Election Commission was established. A history on the Web site of the Federal Election Commission notes that before this the laws were largely ignored, "because none provided an institutional framework to administer their provisions effectively." So what about Schumer's comments that the Supreme Court "decided to overrule the 100-year-old ban on corporate expenditures." This glosses over a lot of detail. Yes, it was more than 100 years ago that the first law limiting corporate spending was passed. But we don't see evidence that the Tillman Act even envisioned a distinction between direct contributions and independent expenditures. And the ban on direct contributions still stands. Perhaps some of you are probably thinking, what's the difference? So what if a company can't contribute directly to a candidate if it can run ads about what a great person Joe is. Well, in practice, it's an important distinction. Corporations aren't allowed to coordinate their ads with the campaigns, and campaigns have their own ideas of messaging and strategy. In his campaign memoir, The Audacity to Win, Obama campaign manager David Plouffe discussed in detail why spending by groups outside the campaign is less effective than commonly thought. We also don't want to downplay the historical importance of the Citizens United ruling. The Citizens United case does overturn some notable precedents and laws. The majority opinion specifically said it was overturning a 1990 precedent, Austin vs. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, which said that the federal government could regulate corporate spending as laid out in the reforms of the 1970s. You could also argue that the Citizens United case overturns the campaign finance portion of the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act. Schumer said the Supreme Court "decided to overrule the 100-year-old ban on corporate expenditures." But he ignores the fact that the ban on direct donations from corporations to campaigns still exists. And the oldest law that specifically banned independent expenditures dated to 1947. You could also argue that we should be dating this from the 1970s campaign finance laws, or even the 1990 Austin case. So he's exaggerating the scope of the ruling and how long the laws have been on the books. We rate Schumer's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-09948	"Sotomayor has had her rulings thrown out by the court a troubling four times."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/27/libertarian-national-committee/libertarian-party-claims-sonia-sotomayor-has-had-f/	Shortly after President Barack Obama announced Sonia Sotomayor as his pick for the Supreme Court, conservatives pulled this bit out of their arsenal: Sotomayor is not up to the job because some of her cases have been thrown out by the Supreme Court. Wendy E. Long of the Judicial Confirmation Network was one of the first to knock Sotomayor's record, saying that she "has an extremely high rate of her decisions being reversed, indicating that she is far more of a liberal activist than even the current liberal activist Supreme Court." Wendy Wright of Concerned Women for America echoed that talking point, saying that Sotomayor's "high reversal rate alone should be enough for us to pause and take a good look at her record." Then there was this from the Libertarian National Committee: " Sotomayor has had her rulings thrown out by the court a troubling four times." We learned pretty quickly that the veracity of this statement depends on a few variables. Let's start by looking at Sotomayor's 11-year tenure on the 2 nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. We found that she has authored hundreds of officially published majority opinions — the White House puts the exact number at 380 — and of those, six have been heard by the Supreme Court. Three have been reversed: Riverkeeper Inc. vs. EPA ; Merrill Lynch vs. Dabit ; and Malesko vs. Correctional Services Corp . Among the other three cases: The Supreme Court affirmed her ruling in Empire Healthchoice Assurance Inc. vs. McVeigh . It affirmed her ruling but but unanimously rejected her reasoning in Knight vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue . The sixth case, Ricci vs. DeStefano , is still pending. So her record so far at the appellate level is three reversals, two upheld and one pending. There's also her time on the U.S. District Court between 1992 and 1998. One of her rulings, Tasini vs. New York Times, et al. , was reversed by the Supreme Court in 1997. That's how the Libertarian Party gets to its total of four reversed opinions. Keep in mind that other Supreme Court justices have seen their share of reversals. For the sake of comparison, Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, like Sotomayor, wrote hundreds of majority opinions during his 16-year tenure on the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. At least two of those were heard by the Supreme Court and both were reversed: Jo Anne B. Barnhart , Commissioner of Social Security, Petitioner vs. Pauline Thomas and Rompilla vs. Beard . We were also caught up by the word "troubling" in the Libertarian Party's statement, so we turned to Stephen Wermiel , a law professor at American University Washington College of Law, for some perspective. In fact, the Supreme Court increasingly has a reputation for reversing most of the approximately 80 cases it hears every term, Wermiel said. Indeed, according to data compiled by SCOTUSblog .com, the Supreme Court's reversal rate in 2008 was 85 percent, 61 percent in 2007, and 72 percent in 2006. Having a case reversed "is not a badge of shame, or a stigma of stupidity or inferiority," Wermiel said. "It's a sign that reasonable minds had a different approach to the issue." Tom Goldstein , a partner at law firm Akin Gump and author of SCOTUSblog .com, agreed. "In a career as long as [ Sotomayor's ], she's easily in the mainstream," compared to the reversal rate of other judges. "The numbers game is childish," said Michael Greve, a legal scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. "You are dealing with all of six cases. What of it?" The best way to evaluate Sotomayor — or anyone else nominated to the highest court — is to look at individual opinions, he added. So the Libertarian Party is correct that Sotomayor was reversed four times: three at the appellate level and one at the district court level. But this is out of hundreds of potential cases. Furthermore, the Libertarian Party's implication that four cases represents a high rate of reversal just doesn't hold up. Her record is not far off from another well-known justice, Samuel Alito , nor is it at all unusual for the Supreme Court to reverse most of the cases it hears every year, according to legal experts we spoke to. We rate their statement Half True.	None	Libertarian National Committee	None	None	None	2009-05-27T16:40:16	2009-05-26	['None']
pomt-09466	The Democrats' health care bills would end "the denial of ... coverage to those who have a pre-existing condition," while the Republican bill would not.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/03/nancy-pelosi/pelosi-says-democrats-tackle-preexisting-condition/	Few elements of today's health care system are as maddening to most Americans as the denial of insurance to those who suffer from pre-existing conditions. A Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll from September 2009 found that eight of every 10 respondents -- including 67 percent of Republicans, 80 percent of independents and 88 percent of Democrats -- would support a requirement that insurance companies cover anyone who applies. So it's not surprising that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., would tout her efforts to achieve that policy goal in a Feb. 28, 2010, interview on ABC's This Week. Sitting down with host Elizabeth Vargas, Pelosi outlined some differences between her approach and that of House Republicans. One example, she said, "is ending the denial of ... coverage to those who have a pre-existing condition. The Democrats have that in their bill. The Republicans do not." We looked at the bills and checked with experts across the ideological spectrum to gauge whether Pelosi is making a fair comparison. What we found is that both bills explicitly take on the issue of pre-existing conditions, but the policy prescriptions differ, complicating the process of analyzing Pelosi's claim. First we'll look at the Democratic bill. Most observers would agree that Pelosi is correct that the House bill -- which passed her chamber narrowly last year -- does indeed end the denial of coverage for those who have a pre-existing condition, though not without some caveats. The House bill -- in language later echoed by President Barack Obama's proposed bill -- bars the exclusion of applicants due to a pre-existing condition in three settings: in the individual market (that is, in policies bought separately by families and individuals), in the exchange (the new, virtual marketplace for purchasing insurance that would be set up by the bill), and in the small group market (policies purchased through small employers). One caveat is that this policy wouldn't take effect immediately; it would begin Jan. 1, 2014. Until the new rules kick in, individuals who have been uninsured for at least six months and have a pre-existing medical condition could enroll in a "high-risk pool" with subsidized premiums. (Remember the term "high-risk pool" -- we'll encounter it again shortly.) There's a second caveat, too: Michael Cannon, a health care expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, says that the Democratic approach could have unintended consequences. While the law would bar outright rejections of applicants with pre-existing conditions, he said, there's nothing to stop insurance companies from treating such patients poorly, in the hope of foisting them -- and their higher health care bills -- on their competitors. Indeed, Cannon suggests, a failure to act this way could endanger the very economic viability of these insurers. "The Democratic bills create such perverse incentives for insurers to offer inadequate care and lousy customer service that sick people with insurance may feel like the bill made things worse," Cannon said. Still, even taking into account these caveats, there's ample evidence that Pelosi is on solid ground when she states that the Democratic bill "would end 'the denial of ... coverage to those who have a pre-existing condition' " -- though it might take a few years to get there. What about the Republican bill? The bill in question is an amendment offered by House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, that was voted down along party lines shortly before the Democratic bill passed. This measure explicitly targets the issue of pre-existing conditions -- in fact, in the bill's preamble, it says the purpose of the act "is to take meaningful steps to lower health care costs and increase access to health insurance coverage (especially for individuals with pre-existing conditions)." However, it goes about it in a very different way from the Democratic bill -- and that led our sources to vary widely in their assessments of Pelosi's claim. Rather than outlawing such denials by insurance companies, the Republican bill would instead make sure that those with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage -- somewhere. It would do this by creating -- here's that phrase again -- "high-risk pools." These pools would guarantee those with pre-existing conditions an offer of coverage. The Republican bill would also cap the premiums charged by such pools and provide funding to help states manage them. Now, it's true that the Democratic approach also uses high-risk pools. But the architects of the Democratic bills envision them as a stopgap solution. The Republican measure, by contrast, considers them the permanent solution. And many health care experts say that high-risk pools are too flawed a concept to be relied upon over the long term. This belief is based on a track record from more than two dozen states that have implemented high-risk pools. Health economists often talk about "community rating" -- the idea that premiums can be kept down if you insure a large enough and diverse enough pool of people. This happens because those who are healthier (and cheaper to cover) effectively subsidize those who are sicker (and more expensive). But by their very nature, high-risk pools are not diverse. They take the sickest and most expensive patients who are not already covered by Medicare, Medicaid or another type of health plan. By concentrating sicker patients in the same plan, these pools can't rely on healthier, cheaper patients to shoulder the cost burden. So high-risk pools usually face steep costs and, in turn, steep premiums for beneficiaries (or for the government entities that subsidize those beneficiaries). These high costs have limited the appeal of high-risk pools. According to Pelosi's office, only about 200,000 Americans belong to the existing state high-risk pools -- a tiny fraction of the 46 million uninsured Americans. The Republican bill's incentives could boost enrollment, but to truly become a long-term solution would require significant subsidies -- more, critics say, than the Republican bill provides. Jonathan Cohn, a health care journalist, recently wrote in the New Republic, a liberal magazine, that the GOP bill "sets aside about $4 billion a year when fully phased in. By comparison, when John McCain proposed creating high-risk pools in the 2008 presidential campaign, his economic adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, estimated it would take between $7 billion and $10 billion a year to cover all of the medically uninsurable through them." So, what to make of this? We feel reasonably confident about two things. One is that the GOP approach doesn't explicitly end "the denial of ... coverage to those who have a pre-existing condition," as Pelosi indicated. Insurers would still be able to discriminate against those with pre-existing conditions; the policy would instead allow those who are rejected to be provided access to coverage elsewhere. The second is that while it's impossible to know whether the Republican approach would succeed or fail, it's clear that many health experts are skeptical about the GOP's ability to provide coverage to all or virtually all of those who have pre-existing conditions. Ultimately, both parties' approaches have their critics. But we believe that, despite some caveats, Pelosi is basically correct in saying that the Democratic approach would explicitly end "the denial of ... coverage to those who have a pre-existing condition." As for Pelosi's belief that the Republican approach fails to do the same, she unfairly glosses over the fact that the GOP proposal makes it a high-priority goal and that it provides a path (albeit a controversial one) to get there. Still, Pelosi is correct that under the GOP plan, insurers would still be able to deny coverage to those with pre-existing conditions. On balance, then, we rate her statement Mostly True.

pomt-13524	"Illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion a year."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/01/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-illegal-immigration-costs-113-bi/	In his speech in Arizona, Donald Trump outlined all the ways he plans to address illegal immigration if elected to the White House. The United States has to act, he said Aug. 31, because illegal immigration comes at a steep cost. "Illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion a year. And this is what we get," Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, said. "For the money we are going to spend on illegal immigration over the next 10 years, we could provide 1 million at-risk students with a school voucher, which so many people are wanting." We wondered if illegal immigration costs taxpayers $113 billion a year. We asked Trump’s campaign for the source of his data but did not hear back. Fox News’ Sean Hannity presented the $113 billion figure a few days earlier in a town hall interview with Trump, citing a 2013 report from Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group seeking reduced immigration. FAIR’s report says $113 billion represents the total cost at the federal, state and local levels for undocumented immigrants. The vast majority -- $84 billion -- is paid by state and local governments. The $113 billion is not a net cost. Taking into consideration federal, state and local tax payments made by the undocumented population, the net cost would be about $99 billion, according to the FAIR report. The report details federal expenses for education, medical treatment, law enforcement, public assistance and general expenditures covering people here illegally. General expenses include "non-enumerated functions of government," such as the cost of fire departments or of the legislature, the report said. FAIR based its estimates on a pool of 13 million people in the country illegally. It includes at least 3.4 million children who are U.S. citizens born to undocumented parents. That total estimate is higher than figures estimated by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, about 11.4 million by January 2012. Pew Research Center estimated there were 11.3 million unauthorized immigrants in 2014. Before Trump, other Republican officials have used FAIR reports to bolster arguments about the fiscal costs of undocumented immigrants on their state. (PolitiFact has rated similar but state-centric claims in Florida and New Jersey as False, another claim Mostly False in Oregon, and one Half True in Georgia.) One thing we’ve been told over the years: FAIR’s conclusions stem from inexact estimates and assumptions. American Immigration Council, a pro-immigrant think tank, said a previous FAIR report about this topic in 2010 relied "upon flawed and empirically baseless assumptions to inflate its estimate of the costs." In its estimated health care costs, we’ve found FAIR used a survey of hospitals that includes private hospitals, which are not funded by the state government. And its reports have assumed that most students enrolled in English learning classes are children of undocumented immigrants. That’s because "legal immigrants have often studied in the United States or otherwise learned English before immigrating and raise their children to speak English," the 2013 report says. Regarding the inclusion of education expenses for U.S. born children, "Without regard to whether this estimate is accurate, the concept of this being a ‘cost’ attributable to the unauthorized immigrants is subject to debate," said Jeff Passel, a senior demographer at Pew Research Center. The 2013 FAIR study also includes about $2.47 billion in fraudulent use of Medicaid, though it said only anecdotal information is available. FAIR also includes incarceration costs for undocumented immigrants. But federal agencies and immigration experts have told us there’s no definitive source for the total number of inmates in the country illegally. FAIR says it bases its incarceration costs on the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program. The program reimburses states and localities for costs related to incarceration of undocumented criminal immigrants "with at least one felony or two misdemeanor convictions for violations of state or local law, and incarcerated for at least 4 consecutive days during the reporting period," according to the U.S. Department of Justice. "The quibbling about our use of estimates is ludicrous," said Jack Martin, FAIR spokesperson. "All analysis of the impact of illegal aliens is based on estimates. The closest to survey data is the SCAAP data filed by state and local governments. We responsibly noted where we used estimates and why we thought they were reasonable estimates." It’s difficult to determine exact costs of a population for which only estimates are available. Other, lower estimates Steven Camarota, director of research at Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank favoring strict immigration policies, said the cost of illegal immigration is not known for sure but could be under $113 billion. He pointed us to another report by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. Households led by undocumented immigrants received about $85 billion a year in benefits in 2010, according to the report. The Heritage Foundation report found that in 2010, there were about 3.44 million households headed by undocumented immigrants and on average, each household received about $24,721 in government benefits and services, such as public education, police and fire protection. That report also takes into account expenses tied to some U.S. citizens -- about 4 million children born in the United States to parents living in the country illegally. "These children would not reside in the U.S. if their parents had not chosen to enter and remain in the nation unlawfully," the report said. "Obviously, any analysis of the fiscal cost of unlawful immigration must therefore include the costs associated with these children, because those costs are a direct and inevitable result of the unlawful immigration of the parents." Fiscal concerns related to undocumented immigrants are driven by a disparity in services they use and taxes they pay, Camarota said. "Most immigrants come to work, including illegal immigrants," Camarota said. "Illegal immigrants are a fiscal drain not because they are illegal or immigrants, or lazy and don’t work, but because people at that level of education use a lot in social services and pay little in taxes." About 50 percent of adult undocumented immigrants have less than a high school education, in comparison to about 8 percent of the U.S. born-adult population who have not graduated from high school, Pew Research Center has found. According to the Heritage report, the average household led by an undocumented immigrant without a high school degree in 2010 paid around $8,860 in taxes, compared to about $10,900 in taxes paid by a household led by a non-immigrant without a high school degree. Overall, households of all educational levels led by undocumented immigrants paid about $10,300 in 2010, according to Heritage. Costs of the unauthorized population have been debated before, though recent, nonpartisan estimates are scarce. In 1995, the U.S. General Accounting Office reported that a professor emeritus of economics had pegged the net cost of undocumented immigrants to federal, state and local governments at $11.9 billion in 1992. A review of the professor’s work published in 1994 by the Urban Institute, a policy research organization, rebutted that amount, adjusting it to $1.9 billion. The professor, Donald Huddle, in a separate exercise estimated net costs between $16 billion and $21.6 billion for 1994, the GAO report noted. The 1994 range of estimates assumed an undocumented population between 4 million and 5.4 million. (Huddle also rebutted the Urban Institute’s rebuttal.) "Because little data are available on illegal aliens’ use of public services and tax payments, the various indirect approaches used to estimate costs and revenues were often based on assumptions whose reasonableness is unknown," the report said. "A great deal of uncertainty remains about the actual national fiscal impact of illegal aliens." A 2007 report from the Congressional Budget Office examined the impact of unauthorized immigrants on state and local governments and found that they pay less in taxes than what they receive through state and local public services. It also noted they are prohibited from many federal benefits. The Congressional Budget Office report analyzed 29 reports and said none attempted to look at total costs and revenues. Estimates that don’t factor in positive economic impacts by unauthorized immigrants don’t tell the whole story, said Michelle Mittelstadt, director of communications for Migration Policy Institute, a think tank that studies immigration trends. She noted that the Social Security Administration reported that in 2010 unauthorized immigrants paid a net $12 billion into the trust funds. Our ruling Trump said, "Illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion a year." Trump presented this figure as a hard fact to make his case, and not as the rough, high-end estimate that it is. The figure matches a 2013 study by a group that wants to reduce immigration, FAIR. It’s uncertain how much immigrants in the United States illegally cost taxpayers, but FAIR’s data is largely based on broad estimates and assumptions. Another report by a conservative think tank pegged the amount at about $85 billion a year. Reports by pro-immigration or neutral groups have come in significantly lower, and other reports have been inconclusive. Estimating the costs of illegal immigration is extremely difficult and produces dramatically different figures, depending on the source. Yes, there are costs. But Trump is selecting the highest of all possible estimates from a range that varies widely. We rate Trump’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-13727	Says U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson "opposes faster broadband internet in small towns" and "got nearly $90,000 in campaign contributions from the telecom special interests."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/jul/27/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/wisconsin-democrats-claim-ron-johnson-opposes-fast/	In June 2016, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson aired a TV ad emphasizing his humble beginnings as a dishwasher and machine operator. The next day, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin released a radio ad arguing just the opposite. The ad painted the Republican Johnson as a "multi-millionaire CEO turned Senator" out of touch with the needs of Wisconsinites living in rural areas. "Living in the country doesn’t mean we should have fewer opportunities," the speaker says. "Unfortunately, that’s what Wisconsin gets with Sen. Ron Johnson." Later the speaker says: "He opposes faster broadband internet in small towns. Maybe because he got nearly $90,000 in campaign contributions from the telecom special interests." Former U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold, running against Johnson, has argued for rural broadband to be more like a public utility. Johnson opposes that idea. But that doesn’t mean he opposes bringing faster broadband to rural areas. Let’s examine the two parts of the claim one at a time. Faster internet in rural small towns Many Wisconsinites in rural areas lack access to reliable, high-speed internet. While the Federal Communications Commission has said maximizing access to broadband internet is a priority, there is widespread disagreement about how to pay for the infrastructure upgrades needed to make it a reality. Harry Hartfield, communications director for the Democratic Party of Wisconsin said Johnson’s voting record demonstrates he opposes to faster broadband in rural areas. He pointed to two votes in particular: In 2012, Johnson voted for a Senate bill amendment that would have eliminated the authority of the Agriculture Department to increase the amount of federal grants to provide broadband access in rural areas. In 2013, Johnson voted against a Senate bill amendment that established a pilot program to expand high speed broadband service to rural areas. "If (Johnson) supported faster internet in rural communities, he would have supported legislation that did just that," Hartfield said. Hartfield also noted Johnson and five other Republican senators argued the definition of broadband was "too fast" in a 2016 letter to the FCC chairman, since few applications require download speeds of 25 Mbps, the new standard. They gave the example of Netflix, which recommends download speeds of 5 Mbps to stream high-definition video. The letter’s authors said they worried increased regulation as a result of the standard would disincentivize telecommunications companies to offer higher speeds. Barry Orton, a professor emeritus of telecommunications at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said that most households have more than one person using the internet at once, which makes faster speeds necessary. "Why are they writing a letter saying don’t expand the broadband definition?" said Orton, who helped Feingold’s campaign develop its broadband materials. "Because expansion of the broadband definition doesn’t help existing providers that are offering less than that." For its part, Johnson’s campaign says he supports increased broadband connectivity — but wants the private sector deliver the services. "Ron has worked on a bipartisan basis to create an environment where more broadband companies can invest and innovate to provide better internet access and more choice across Wisconsin," Johnson’s campaign said in an April statement. Campaign spokesman Brian Reisinger provided two additional letters to support this stance. A 2013 letter signed by Johnson and U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat, urged the FCC to finalize its plan to distribute funds for deployment of broadband to rural areas. A 2014 letter signed by more than 40 senators asked the FCC to carefully update rules governing broadband in rural areas to encourage competition. So, while the party cited two votes, it did not give a full picture of Johnson’s record on the matter. Indeed, there may be multiple ways to achieve the same goal. Contributions from telecom special interests The ad also claims Johnson’s campaign got "nearly $90,000" in contributions from telecommunications special interests. The Democratic Party of Wisconsin cited OpenSecrets.org, a website that pulls from Federal Election Committee data, which shows Johnson received at least $95,000 in contributions since 2010 from political action committees representing "telecom services" companies, including AT&T, Charter and Comcast. Our rating The Democratic Party’s radio ad said Johnson "opposes faster broadband internet in small towns" and he "got nearly $90,000 in campaign contributions from the telecom special interests." Johnson’s voting record shows he opposed two particular proposals to grow faster broadband in rural areas and one signed letter to the FCC showed he was against a faster definition of broadband. But two other letters to the FCC suggest he’s in favor of faster rural broadband — but concerned with its execution. Johnson’s campaign has said he supports using the private sector to grow rural broadband. The second part of the claim is on point — Johnson actually received somewhat more from the industry than the ad claimed. On balance, we rate the claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3c81ce84-1d39-472e-ace6-9051b26d8d36	None	Democratic Party of Wisconsin	None	None	None	2016-07-27T05:00:00	2016-06-23	['United_States']
pomt-04921	Says U.S. Senate candidate Eric Hovde has ‘no problem with raising taxes.’	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/aug/01/club-growth/club-growth-says-hovde-has-no-problem-raising-taxe/	Trying to boost Republican Mark Neumann’s bid for U.S. Senate, a national conservative group is blasting away at Neumann rivals Tommy Thompson and Eric Hovde. The message: Both are big taxers. The national Club for Growth, which has endorsed Neumann, uses a widely aired TV ad to highlight nine instances of tax increases during Tommy Thompson’s 14 years as Wisconsin governor -- years marked, as we found in rating a Thompson claim Mostly True, by a decline in the overall tax burden. The group had a much smaller record to comb through on Hovde, a banker and investment-fund manager and first-time candidate. "In a national TV interview, Hovde said he had no problem with raising taxes," the ad says. "And Hovde supported tax-raising Gov. Jim Doyle. On taxes, Hovde’s like Thompson, only worse." The ad shows a smiling Hovde at the start of a 2009 TV appearance as a financial pundit on CNBC’s "Squawk Box" beneath the words: "No Problem Raising Taxes." Hovde fired back with his own TV spot that calls the Neumann (actually Club for Growth’s) tax accusation "false." (The campaign acknowledges Hovde gave $500 to Democrat Doyle’s re-election campaign in 2005. It has not explained why, but notes that Hovde has given almost exclusively to Republicans, and in much larger amounts.) So, did Hovde’s remarks suggest he has no problem with raising taxes? We watched the nearly 11-minute discussion between Hovde and the cable show’s hosts and found a brief exchange on taxes that closely -- but not exactly -- mirrors the language in the group’s ad. The background Hovde’s March 3, 2009 appearance on CNBC focused on the ongoing financial crisis and his criticisms of actions under both Republican President George W. Bush and newly elected President Barack Obama. Hovde said the country was in a "depression," Obama’s stimulus bill was unfocused and out of control federal spending was taking the country into "quasi-Socialist" territory. At the 7:25 mark of the segment, as the Journal Sentinel’s Dan Bice reported in April 2012, Hovde abruptly turned the talk to taxes, tax breaks and the Obama administration. Unprompted, he began: "Look, I have no problem with me getting charged higher taxes. I’ve been blessed in my life and I’ve been very fortunate. But some of the things that they’ve done are just insane." Then he referred to an Obama 2009 proposal to reduce the mortgage-interest tax deduction for households earning more than $250,000. "Taking away deductions on home mortgage payments -- I don’t need it, but a lot of other people do." Hovde said. "We’re in a housing recession -- are you kidding me?" So, the Club for Growth claims Hovde said he had "no problem with raising taxes." He actually said: "I have no problem with me getting charged higher taxes." That’s a significant difference, especially since he immediately noted that eliminating housing deductions, for instance, would be unwise in a recession. The timing is also important. In 2009, Hovde was a private citizen, not a candidate running on a platform of what he would do if elected. An candidate can have a personal opinion on an issue but may decide to vote another way for a variety of reasons. For instance, a lawmaker personally would not seek an abortion but votes pro-choice to leave the decision up to the mother. It’s also unclear from the 2009 CNBC interview exactly what Hovde was talking about. Did he mean paying more through a higher top tax rate? Through a repeal of the Bush tax cuts? When asked about the claim, the Club for Growth noted it would take a tax increase of some kind for Hovde’s personal tax bill to rise. As a candidate in 2012, Hovde told Bice he was not referring to Obama’s so-called Buffett Rule legislation to make sure high earners pay at least 30 percent in federal income tax (a bill sponsored by U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin, the Democratic candidate in the race). Hovde has said he was thinking of the tax break on "carried interest" -- the portion of a fund’s investment gains taken by fund managers (like Hovde) as compensation. It also applies to venture capitalists and private equity specialists. In an interview, Hovde agreed that it would be a tax increase for that narrow group. Some government estimates put the total at more than $1 billion a year. But let’s look at his tax positions as a candidate in 2012. Hovde has pledged to reduce individual income tax rates across the board, drop the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent and eliminate the estate tax. So Hovde has made it clear he is against raising tax rates. In fact, he wants dramatic cuts in people’s tax bills. That leaves his support for eliminating tax deductions -- a move that would bring the government more revenue. Hovde says he would vote to eliminate "nearly all" of the deductions in the current tax code, which he sees as riddled with favors to big corporations at the expense of small businesses. He also thinks the individual tax code is too complicated. And he told us he still favors eliminating the "carried interest" tax provision, which he sees as eliminating a loophole. Hovde, who has made debt and deficit reduction a major theme, has told voters he would accept a budget-balancing deal that gets $10 in spending cuts for every $1 in new revenue through the elimination of loopholes or deductions. He told us his strong preference would be that such a deal include cuts in the tax rates. He said he would consider supporting a 10-to-1 deal that holds rates steady instead of lowering them, depending on which loopholes or deductions are removed. But does that constitute a tax increase? Even conservative Republicans disagree on this. Americans for Tax Reform’s widely publicized "taxpayer protection pledge" frowns on deduction eliminations unless the new revenue is completely offset by lower rates. Thompson and Neumann have signed that pledge, but Hovde has not. A leading conservative in the Senate, Republican Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, has criticized the group’s pledge as too narrow to allow for smart reform of the tax code. PolitiFact National consulted a range of experts in January 2012 in evaluating a Mitt Romney claim that Obama "has raised taxes 19 times." Views differed on some issues, but the consensus was that eliminating or limiting such deductions as those for prescription or other medical expenses clearly deserved the label of tax increases. Donald Marron, director of the Tax Policy Center, told us it’s case by case -- some of these "tax preferences" are best seen as taxes, but others as spending programs in disguise. Given Hovde’s pledge to wipe out nearly all deductions, it seems clear that some of those moves could be labeled as tax increases. Even Hovde acknowledged eliminating the "carried interest" provision would be a tax increase for a narrow group. Our conclusion The national Club for Growth used Hovde’s own words from a cable TV interview in 2009 to frame him as in favor of raising taxes. Hovde said what he said -- he would pay more, which put him on record as open to some kind of tax increase. There’s no other way to read it. But the ad takes the 2009 comment and alters it in a subtle but significant way, changing the context. By also changing the timing, leaving viewers thinking Hovde is campaigning in 2012 on a plan to raise taxes, the issue is further distorted. In the current campaign, Hovde has made it clear he wants dramatically lower taxes and would not raise rates, while staying open to a net revenue increase from loophole elimination as part of a massive spending-and-tax-cut deal. That doesn’t square with the breezy portrayal of Hovde as having "no problem raising taxes." The Truth-O-Meter says Mostly False claims have an element of truth but ignore critical facts that would give a different impression. We think that fits the Club for Growth ad claim. Mostly False.

pomt-03315	Says residents of Texas and San Antonio can be fired or denied jobs because they are gay.	half-true	/texas/statements/2013/jul/26/leticia-van-de-putte/leticia-van-de-putte-says-residents-texas-and-san-/	In a June 14, 2013, opinion article in the San Antonio Express-News, state Sen. Leticia Van de Putte urged the city to "pass updates to the city code ensuring that the city, and those who contract with the city, will not discriminate against their employees because of their sexual orientation, gender identity or veterans' status." Supporting the measures, which the City Council was expected to consider in August 2013, the Democrat said of a fellow San Antonio resident, an Iraq veteran: "Here in his home state and his home city, he can be denied or fired from a job just because he is gay." We figured Van de Putte was making a broad statement about all Texans and all San Antonians; a spokesman for the senator, Lee Nichols, confirmed that. Like nearly all U.S. states, Texas is an employment-at-will state. That means, as the Texas Municipal League puts it in a legal white paper, "Generally, employees without a written employment contract can be fired for good cause, bad cause, or no cause at all," as long as that cause is not illegal. Section 21.051 of the Texas Labor Code, Nichols said via email, makes it illegal for employers to discriminate against employees or applicants because of "race, color, disability, religion, sex, national origin, or age," but does not mention sexual orientation. Van de Putte offered a bill during the 2013 Legislature’s regular session to extend that protection, he said. Here’s the law, part of the Texas Labor Code’s Title 2, Subtitle A, Chapter 21: SUBCHAPTER B. UNLAWFUL EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES Sec. 21.051. DISCRIMINATION BY EMPLOYER. An employer commits an unlawful employment practice if because of race, color, disability, religion, sex, national origin, or age the employer: (1) fails or refuses to hire an individual, discharges an individual, or discriminates in any other manner against an individual in connection with compensation or the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment; or (2) limits, segregates, or classifies an employee or applicant for employment in a manner that would deprive or tend to deprive an individual of any employment opportunity or adversely affect in any other manner the status of an employee. So while it’s illegal in Texas to "deprive an individual of any employment opportunity" or refuse to hire someone because of gender, race and several other factors, it isn’t against state law to do so because they are homosexual or of any other sexual orientation. Spokesman Charlie Joughin at the Human Rights Campaign, a national gay rights group, told us 21 states have laws meant to protect residents against job discrimination based on sexual orientation. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that "in 29 states in this country you can still get fired for … being gay," as Martina Navratilova claimed in a May 2013 interview. PolitiFact rated the ex-tennis star’s statement Half True, noting significant exceptions. In all states, federal and state government employees have certain protections because courts have backed the idea that sexual orientation is one of the categories that would permit a discrimination lawsuit under the right of equal protection in the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. PolitiFact also noted that cities or individual employers can have anti-discrimination policies even if their state does not. That’s the case in several Texas cities. City of Austin spokeswoman Patricia Fraga told us by phone that Austin ordinances protect against discrimination citywide in employment, housing and public accommodations -- a term that takes in businesses such as restaurants, theaters, bars and stores -- for reasons that include sexual orientation. Ordinances in Dallas and Fort Worth bar such discrimination citywide. Houston has several related ordinances, spokesman Justin Concepcion of the mayor’s office told us by phone. El Paso has a citywide ordinance against housing and public accommodation discrimination for sexual orientation, but not employment, deputy city attorney Laura Gordon told us by phone. San Antonio’s website advises its employees, "Unlawful discrimination may be occurring if you are treated differently because of" reasons that include sexual orientation. The proposed measures were described by the Express-News in a July 25, 2013, news blog entry as a "proposal to fix the city’s anti-discrimination policies, which right now are a hodgepodge of disparate references scattered across the city’s code." Van de Putte spokesman Servando Esparza told us by phone that protections at the city level were important, but not a comprehensive guarantee of rights, because a resident could move or rules could change as new city officials came in. "We wanted to make sure this was solved at the state level," he said. Our ruling Van de Putte said that a Texan and San Antonian could be "denied or fired from a job just because he is gay." In Texas, it appears, many workers can be fired for nearly any reason. That said, state law also doesn’t bar discrimination based on sexual orientation. But several major cities do and Texans who work for state or federal government -- and even for San Antonio city government itself -- have some protections, too. We rate this statement, which does not account for these important details, as Half True.	None	Leticia Van de Putte	None	None	None	2013-07-26T18:40:48	2013-06-14	['San_Antonio', 'Texas']
pomt-09750	About 750,000 people die in China each year from auto emissions.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/08/nancy-pelosi/car-pollution-china-doesnt-cause-many-deaths-nany-/	House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has long considered herself a human rights activist and an environmental advocate. So during a recent trip to China, Pelosi discussed how the issues overlap during a meeting with the country's president, Hu Jintao. She recounted the meeting for television host Charlie Rose on the Oct. 5, 2009, edition of his show. "I took a little bit of a different approach this time in terms of talking about environmental justice because . . . 750,000 people, approximately, die in China each year from auto emissions. The Gobi Desert is encroaching on the rest of China. There are sandstorms in Beijing. They know that . . . there's something that has to be done about climate change and environmental protection and that — and so my pitch to them is there has to be environmental justice. As you develop and as you compete, you can't leave people behind." We wondered if the death toll from auto emissions could possibly be as high as Pelosi claims. But first, some background. Most scientists believe that increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, such as nitrous oxide, are due in part to the number of cars on the road that do not burn fuel efficiently. Our cars release greenhouse gases that trap heat from the sun and have caused the Earth to warm. There's also evidence that the heat-trapping qualities of greenhouse gases lead to an increase of particulate matter and carcinogens in the atmosphere — bad news for those with asthma and other respiratory illnesses. We called Pelosi's office and they pointed us to 2007 news reports about a World Bank analysis that focused on the cost of pollution in China. According to the Financial Times, the Chinese government asked the World Bank to exclude information about how many people die each year as the result of air and water pollution. (For its part, the World Bank says the numbers were left out due to "some uncertainties about calculation methods and its application.") "Missing from this report are the research project’s findings that high air-pollution levels in Chinese cities (are) leading to the premature deaths of 350,000-400,000 people each year," the July 2, 2007, Financial Times story said. "A further 300,000 people die prematurely each year from exposure to poor air indoors, according to advisers, but little discussion of this issue survived in the report because it was outside the ambit of the Chinese ministries which sponsored the research." On top of that, 60,000 premature deaths were related to poor-quality water that resulted in diarrhea, and stomach, liver and bladder cancers, according to the story. So, Pelosi is relying on a news story's summary of World Bank data that was not officially published but that was obtained by the Financial Times. According to the news story, on the high end, there are 760,000 deaths annually from water and air pollution, not just auto emissions, as Pelosi said on the Charlie Rose Show. We took a look at the report, and found that it provided a lot of compelling evidence that Chinese citizens suffer a great deal from air and water pollution and that smog and dirty water in that country lead to many premature deaths. But it offered no overall numbers, nor did it focus specifically on auto emissions. "Energy consumption, especially coal consumption, is the main source of air pollutants," the report said, noting that medical evidence suggests "outdoor air pollution is a contributing cause of morbidity and mortality." To get another perspective, we called Mark Jacobson, a civil and environmental engineering professor at Stanford University, who has studied death rates due to carbon dioxide pollution. In 2008, he found that for each increase of 1 degree Celsius caused by carbon dioxide, the resulting air pollution would lead annually to about 1,000 additional deaths in the United States, and 20,000 worldwide. That's on top of the approximately 2 million air pollution-related deaths worldwide, he explained, citing numbers from the World Health Organization. "Home heating and cooking are really the biggest source of deaths," Jacobson said, explaining that, particularly in China, India and other developing countries, cooking is often done with animal dung, wood or coal. "There's a lot of smoke, no ventilation." Indeed, most pollution-related deaths — about 1.6 million of the 2 million overall, according to the WHO — are the result of poor indoor air quality. According to WHO's numbers, that leaves only about 400,000 deaths annually that stem from outdoor pollution — worldwide. Furthermore, outdoor air pollution isn't limited to auto emissions. Much of it comes from agricultural operations, electricity generation and industries that rely heavily on fossil fuels, Jacobson said. So to summarize: Pelosi said that about 750,000 people in China die annually from auto emissions. But she was basing her claim on news reports that relied on data that was never actually published. (When we inquired, the World Bank declined to directly address the statistics.) So even if the World Bank data is correct, Pelosi misinterpreted it by saying that all those deaths are related to auto emissions. On top of that, the World Health Organization estimates that most pollution-related deaths are the result of indoor pollutants (those coal and wood fires we mentioned above), not outdoor ones. So while Pelosi is correct that air pollution is harmful and may be responsible for many deaths in China, she's wrong to say that auto emissions are specifically responsible for 750,000 of them annually. We rate her claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-11866	"It costs nearly five times as much in California to build and maintain a mile of road as it does in the rest of the nation."	false	/california/statements/2017/nov/01/john-cox/does-california-spend-nearly-five-times-much-build/	It’s not cheap to build anything in California. Land and labor is expensive and the state has some of the strictest environmental permitting rules anywhere. Those factors all drive up the cost of building homes, stores and even roads. Republican candidate for governor John Cox has pledged that, if elected, he’ll hack through California’s thicket of regulations, in an effort to reduce expenses. Specifically, Cox wants to reform the California Department of Transportation, or Caltrans, an agency he has described as overstaffed and wasteful. Recently, he claimed Caltrans spends an exorbitant amount to build and maintain each mile of roadway compared with other states. "It costs nearly five times as much in California to build and maintain a mile of road as it does in the rest of the nation," Cox said in an interview published on the Political Vanguard website on Oct. 19, 2017. Cox made a similar claim in a San Francisco Chronicle op-ed on Oct. 18, 2017: "California spends 4.7 times the national average for every mile of roadway we build and maintain, according to the Competitive Enterprise Institute." CEI is a libertarian think tank which sourced the statistic to the Reason Foundation, another free market think tank. Following both statements, Cox went on to advocate for greater reliance on private construction to reduce expenses. There’s a debate about why it’s so expensive to build roads in California. But we’re not fact-checking that debate. Instead, we’re zeroing in on Cox’s specific claims that California's road spending is "nearly five times" per mile compared with other states. Background on John Cox On his campaign website, Cox describes himself as a "Jack Kemp-style Republican who grew up on Chicago’s south-side." Today, he’s a San Diego businessman who "founded an organization that repairs the homes of low-income seniors and individuals with disabilities." His priorities, as listed on his website, include lowering California’s taxes and fighting the influence of special interests. Cox is the chairman of Give Voters a Voice, an effort to repeal California’s recent gas tax increase, which was signed into law this year to raise money for road repairs. The increase includes a 12-cent per gallon gasoline tax increase, which went into effect this week. Our research We asked Cox’s campaign for evidence supporting his claims. It pointed to recent reports by the Reason Foundation, which studies transportation spending. In 2013, the foundation published its "20th Annual Report on the Performance of State Highway Systems." That report shows California spent nearly $680,000 per mile in 2009 on roadways. That was 4.7 times as much as the national average of approximately $144,000 per mile spent in other states. That matches Cox’s claim of "nearly five times" as much. But our research shows, and Cox’s campaign has acknowledged, the information from 2009 is outdated. An updated 2016 Reason Foundation study shows California spent about $420,000 per mile in 2013 compared with the national average spending of about $160,000 per mile in the same year. That data places California’s spending at about 2.5 times the national average, far less than Cox’s claims. We asked Cox’s staff about the discrepancy. David Kersten, a policy analyst with the campaign, said the candidate didn’t have the most up-to-date figures. "When he wrote that (San Francisco Chronicle) op-ed, he didn’t have that new number," Kersten told us in an interview. "Everybody was using the older report." Matt Shupe, Cox’s campaign spokesman, said he and Kersten would update Cox on the new figure and use it in future statements. High admin costs Cox’s staff noted that one category of California’s road spending, administrative costs, totals nearly five times as much the national average, even in the 2016 report. We checked and the report does show that, though Cox’s staffers acknowledged that’s not the same statement the candidate made in the op-ed or in his Political Vanguard interview and at the center of this fact check. Caltrans, the agency targeted by Cox, disagrees with the methodology of the Reason Foundation studies. A Caltrans spokesman said much of the studies’ roadway data is from local streets and roads not built or maintained by the state. The spokesman also noted that California’s state roadways are larger and more congested than in other states, making them more expensive to build and maintain. Representatives for the Reason Foundation did not respond to our interview requests. Our ruling Republican candidate for governor John Cox recently claimed it costs "nearly five times as much" in California to build and maintain a mile of road as it does in the rest of the nation. A study using 2009 data shows California spent 4.7 times as much per mile as the national average on roads. Updated data from 2013 shows the state’s spending still far above the national average at about 2.5 times the cost per mile, but far lower than Cox’s figure. Cox’s campaign staff told us the candidate relied on outdated information and would be updating this figure in future statements. While the candidate’s larger point about higher road spending in California appears to be correct, his specific claim about it being "nearly five times" as much per mile is outdated and wrong.

pomt-14234	"I remain one of the poorer members of the United States Senate."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/14/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-hes-one-poorer-members-united-/	Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders relishes his everyman persona, and during the Democratic presidential debate in Brooklyn, he offered evidence that he’s out of place in the "millionaires’ club" that is the U.S. Senate. "I remain one of the poorer members of the United States Senate," Sanders said. Is that correct? We looked at the most frequently cited rundown of congressional wealth -- an annual study by the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call. We found that Sanders’ net worth does rank him in the bottom one-fifth of the 100-member chamber. Here’s a list showing Sanders and the 18 other senators whose net worth ranked below him for the 2014 calendar year. A negative value means liabilities greater than assets.: Senate net worth rank Senator Minimum net worth 82 Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. $160,000 83 Mike Lee, R-Utah $120,000 84 Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y. $120,000 85 Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. $90,000 86 John Thune, R-S.D. $80,000 87 James Lankford, R-Okla. -$10,000 88 Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. -$50,000 89 Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis. -$80,000 90 Cory Gardner, R-Colo. -$110,000 91 Christopher Murphy, D-Conn. -$140,000 92 Marco Rubio, R-Fla. -$160,000 93 Jack Reed, D-R.I. -$170,000 94 John Cornyn, R-Texas -$230,000 95 Mark Kirk, R-Ill. -$260,000 96 Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. -$350,000 97 Roger Wicker, R-Miss. -$450,000 98 Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii -$460,000 99 Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich. -$590,000 100 Martin Heinrich, D-N.M. -$720,000 We should note some caveats. The Roll Call survey is based on congressional financial disclosure forms, which offer the public only broad ranges of income in various categories. To determine the measurement it used in its ranking -- minimum net worth -- Roll Call used the total minimum reported value of the lawmakers’ assets minus the total minimum reported value of their liabilities. So the real amount could well be higher. In addition, the law exempts various types of holdings from disclosure, including the value of a primary residence, the value of personal possessions that aren’t held for investment purposes, and the value of retirement accounts. (The Center for Responsive Politics has a summary of what must be included in these forms here.) These factors led Roll Call to caution in its survey that "the disclosure forms are imperfect at best." Indeed, the data is vague enough that the differences between the net worths of the senators who cluster around Sanders verge on being indistinguishable. In fact, 10 other senators beyond the list of 18 above had a minimum net worth of less than $400,000 -- Tom Cotton, R-Ark., Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio; Robert Menendez, D-N.J.; Barbara Mikulski, D-Md.; Joni Ernst, R-Iowa; Bob Casey, D-Pa.; Cory Booker, D-N.J.; Rand Paul, R-Ky.; Mike Enzi, R-Wyo.; and Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. That said, Sanders is largely correct that he’s on the lower end of the chamber’s income scale: The median senator, by Roll Call’s calculation, was $1.1 million, or almost seven times Sanders’ net worth. Our ruling Sanders said, "I remain one of the poorer members of the United States Senate." It’s important to remember that the financial-disclosure forms produce values too vague to be 100 percent certain of where each senator ranks in net worth. And with a minimum net worth of $160,000, we wouldn’t say Sanders is poor. That said, a credible calculation using financial disclosure forms put Sanders as having the 19th lowest net worth in the Senate.

pomt-09953	"President Obama's own director of national intelligence, Admiral Blair, put it this way: 'High-value information came from interrogations in which those methods were used and provided a deeper understanding of the al-Qaida organization that was attacking this country.'"	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/22/dick-cheney/dick-cheney-claims-blair-said-high-value-informati/	In a speech on national security, former Vice President Dick Cheney argued that despite all the controversy about the propriety of waterboarding and other "enhanced interrogation" techniques used on terror suspects in the wake of 9/11, one fact has been lost — the techniques worked. And Cheney cited comments from an appointee of President Barack Obama to back up his point. "President Obama's own director of national intelligence, Admiral Blair, put it this way: 'High-value information came from interrogations in which those methods were used and provided a deeper understanding of the al-Qaida organization that was attacking this country,' " Cheney said in a May 21, 2009, speech at the American Enterprise Institute. "Admiral Blair put that conclusion in writing, only to see it mysteriously deleted in a later version released by the administration, the missing 26 words that tell an inconvenient truth." Cheney is right about there being two different versions of an April 16 memo sent by Adm. Dennis C. Blair, President Obama’s director of national intelligence. In a private version of the memo sent to his colleagues, Blair says it's important to remember the context of events that led to the use of enhanced interrogation techniques. "All of us remember the horror of 9/11. For months afterwards we did not have a clear understanding of the enemy we were dealing with, and our every effort was focused on preventing further attacks that would kill more Americans. It was during these months that the CIA was struggling to obtain critical information from captured al-Qaida leaders, and requested permission to use harsher interrogation methods. ... High-value information came from interrogations in which those methods were used and provided deeper understanding of the al-Qaida organization that was attacking this country." That last sentence wasn't included in an abbreviated form of the memo that was released to the public. You can check out both versions here . Here's another line that was cut: "I like to think I would not have approved those methods in the past, but I do not fault those who made the decisions at that time." But the administration isn't the only one guilty of truncating Blair's full position. Cheney failed to mention this statement released by Blair on April 21, "I also strongly supported the president (Obama) when he declared that we would no longer use enhanced interrogation techniques. We do not need these techniques to keep America safe. The information gained from these techniques was valuable in some instances, but there is no way of knowing whether the same information could have been obtained through other means. The bottom line is these techniques have hurt our image around the world, the damage they have done to our interests far outweighed whatever benefit they gave us and they are not essential to our national security." So Cheney mentioned the quote from Blair that the enhanced interrogations provided "high-value information," but failed to mention Blair's later clarification that while the techniques did provide information, there is no way of knowing if that information could have been obtained through other means. Cheney also failed to mention that Blair opposes the use of the controversial interrogation techniques, that he thinks the damage they have caused far outweigh the benefits gained and that they "are not essential to our national security." Cheney neglected to give a full account of Blair's comments. But even that additional context does not refute the core point that Cheney attributes to Blair. Even if Blair has misgivings about the techniques, he has still acknowledged the information from them "was valuable in some instances." We find Cheney's statement Mostly True.

pomt-13098	Kelly Ayotte "voted for a budget that had $90 billion of cuts to Pell Grants."	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2016/nov/05/maggie-hassan/maggie-hassan-says-kelly-ayotte-voted-cut-90-billi/	As Republican U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte and Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan traded barbs in their last debate before Tuesday’s election, the subject once again turned to the rising cost of higher education. Ayotte was asked why she had voted for "budget bills" that would have cut money for Pell Grants, the federal subsidy for needy undergraduates. "That’s just not true," she said. Ayotte said she voted to make "sure there was annual oversight over the spending of Pell Grants." A little later, Hassan, who is running to unseat Ayotte, encouraged people to "check for themselves" regarding Ayotte’s votes. "On March 27, 2015, she voted for a budget that had $90 billion of cuts to Pell Grants. The day before, she voted against an amendment to that budget that would have restored that $90 billion," Hassan said. PolitiFact decided to check it out -- did Ayotte, who often trumpets her support of Pell Grants, in fact vote to cut funding for the program? We reached out to both campaigns, as well as a couple federal budget policy experts. Hassan’s campaign pointed to Ayotte’s votes on a budget resolution conference agreement in 2015 -- in the Congressional Record, S. Con. Res. 11 -- and a proposed amendment to it. The first thing to note is that on March 27, 2015, Ayotte voted on a budget resolution -- which is a document that sets guidelines for the appropriations committees. It’s not a binding spending outline and does not initiate cuts itself. "It doesn’t have the effect of law, it doesn’t go to the President for signature. It’s also a broad ranging document that covers a ton of issues, so you could oppose a provision but support the package," said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. It’s a packet of suggestions -- and, crucially, vague ones at that. Budget resolutions only set "top-line" numbers in broad spending categories the next budget shouldn’t go over. They never get so detailed as to discuss appropriations to individual programs -- including Pell Grants. And again, it’s non-binding. "You can’t really say it cuts a program or it doesn’t cut a program. That’s pretty impossible," said Jason Delisle, of the American Enterprise Institute. So where did the $90 billion figure come from? Hassan’s campaign pointed to remarks made by Shaun Donovan, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, who wrote on April 30, 2015, that the Republican’s budget resolution "eliminates roughly $90 billion in mandatory funding for the Pell Grant program. That would either require significant cuts in other domestic priorities to make up for lost funding or result in deep cuts to the Pell program." But there’s something important to note about Donovan’s statement. It refers to "mandatory" funding. If a budget resolution suggests taking away a program’s "mandatory" spending, that still means the program can recover those funds through discretionary spending -- spending that Congress reviews every year. This is what Ayotte was referring to when she said she wanted to "make sure there was annual oversight over the spending of Pell Grants." Of course, making a program’s spending subject to Congressional approval each year certainly makes it more vulnerable to actual cuts -- especially if total discretionary spending targets go down by $759 billion -- because it would compete for those other dollars in a smaller pool. And that’s why several higher education advocacy groups denounced the Republican budget plan. But strictly speaking, making a program’s funding discretionary doesn’t actually cut its spending. As noted by the Hassan campaign, Ayotte did vote against an amendment to the budget resolution, put forward by Senator Al Franken of Minnesota. According to its statement of purpose, that amendment "(restored) the $89,000,000,000 in cuts to Federal Pell Grants in the Republican budget." Republicans, who objected to the assumption their budget resolution would cut Pell Grants, universally voted against it, and Democrats universally voted for it. But Delisle also notes that while statement of purpose for Franken’s amendment made explicit mention of Pell Grants, the text of the amendment itself didn’t. Instead, it simply noted top-line budget categories in the resolution and increased the amount assigned to them. In short, the amendment made the assumption that by reducing or increasingly certain overall top-line spending targets, a certain amount would or wouldn’t trickle down to Pell Grants. But it didn’t actually point to a spot in the budget resolution where a certain amount of money was allocated to Pell Grants and assign more dollars to the program -- because that spot doesn’t exist. Our ruling Maggie Hassan says Kelly Ayotte "voted for a budget that had $90 billion of cuts to Pell Grants. The day before, she voted against an amendment to that budget that would have restored that $90 billion." What Ayotte voted on was a budget resolution, a broad outline for spending, which is non-specific and non-binding. It’s not the same as a vote for an actual budget, which dictates federal spending. Moreover, the resolution didn’t call for a cut to Pell Grants. It made the spending discretionary, rather than mandatory. The change would have made the grants more vulnerable, but it’s not the same as a cut . We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-02229	"Eighty percent of Wall Street executives and their spouses' donations go to Democrats."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/17/louie-gohmert/texas-republican-rep-louie-gohmert-says-80-percent/	You’ll often hear Democratic politicians decry income inequality and the pattern of the rich getting richer. But at the New Hampshire Freedom Summit -- a gathering in Manchester, N.H., sponsored by the conservative groups Americans for Prosperity and Citizens United -- Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, got into the action, too. Gohmert, though, took aim at Democrats for hypocrisy. "The dirty little secret on Wall Street: Eighty percent of the Wall Street executives’ and their spouses' donations go to Democrats," Gohmert said. "It’s like they’ve got some kind of little sweet deal, where we’ll call you fat cats and demean you and stuff, but you will get richer than your wildest dreams. It’s time for that to stop." We wondered: Is it really true that "80 percent of Wall Street executives and their spouses' donations go to Democrats"? We asked Gohmert’s office for their sourcing, and they provided several columns in the National Review by Michael Franc of the conservative Heritage Foundation. In one of them, Franc wrote that "a review of Federal Election Commission data for the current presidential-election cycle sheds light on this important question. Judging by who they support for president, a strong majority of employees at the highest reaches of Wall Street’s big financial institutions are, well, big liberals. More Wall Streeters shower far more money -- both overall as well as on average -- on the more liberal presidential candidates than on their more conservative alternatives." Franc wrote that he used Fundrace 2008, a campaign-finance data tool created by the Huffington Post, to look at donations from such employees as investment bankers, managing directors and senior managing directors. He found that at Bear Stearns, 68 percent of individual donations went to Democrats. At JPMorgan Chase, it was 75 percent. At Lehman Brothers, it was 69 percent. At Goldman Sachs, the Democratic share was more than two-thirds (Franc didn’t specify in his article), while at Morgan Stanley it was more than half. At American International Group, it was 76 percent. Indeed, among the firms Franc looked into, only individuals at Merrill Lynch gave a majority to Republicans. Right off the top, though, there’s an important caveat to how Gohmert portrayed Franc’s figures. Gohmert used the present tense, but -- as you might expect, given the presence of the now-defunct Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers in the data and the use of a tool called "Fundrace 2008" -- Franc’s research was both conducted and published in 2008. Not only is that four campaign cycles ago, but there’s also been a sea change in Wall Street’s partisan preferences since then. The Center for Responsive Politics, which downloads Federal Election Commission disclosures by donors and candidates and sorts them into user-friendly categories, addressed this question in a 2013 report. The center wrote that Wall Street money, like much big money in politics, follows power, and after Democrats took control of the House and Senate in 2006, they began to increase their share of donations. "As recently as 2009, Democrats were collecting more campaign cash from Wall Street than Republicans," the center wrote. However, the center added, "that dynamic shifted at the end of 2009, with more money flowing to Republicans in 2010." And starting in 2011, the report continued, "the gap widened and Wall Street's financial support for one party (the GOP) began to tip the scales." In the 2012 campaign cycle, donations by individuals in the center’s "securities and investment" category -- the closest category to "Wall Street" -- were running 70 percent to Republicans, 30 percent to Democrats, and so far during the 2014 cycle, 63 percent of the industry’s money is going to Republicans, with 36 percent to Democrats. For individuals in the category "commercial banks," 71 percent of donations went to Republicans in 2012 and 74 percent so far in 2014. And for the umbrella category "finance, insurance, and real estate," 66 percent went to Republicans in 2012 and 58 percent so far in 2014. For each of these three categories, the year Franc based his data on -- 2008 -- was either the high point or close to the high point for Wall Street donors’ friendliness to Democrats (at least going back to 1990, when the center began collecting this data). Douglas Weber, a Center for Responsive Politics senior researcher, noted that Goldman Sachs had a clear Democratic edge in donations between 1990 and 2008, peaking at 2008 with 75 percent to Democrats in total giving (which, unlike Franc’s data above, includes political action committees and outside groups). But Goldman has since turned on a dime, with the share of donations to Democrats shifting to just 39 percent in 2010, 36 percent in 2012 and 34 percent so far in 2014. "Wall Street liked candidate Obama more than President Obama," Weber said. So by relying on Franc’s data from 2008, Gohmert isn’t just using old data -- he’s using the peak historical year for Democratic giving, and ignoring three subsequent cycles in which Wall Street tilted its donations in precisely the opposite direction. There are other problems with Gohmert’s claim beyond it being outdated: • None of Franc’s published data reaches 80 percent. Gohmert’s stated percentage exaggerates even what’s in Franc’s data. • Gohmert conflated "Democrats" with "Obama" and the presidential race with all races. Franc, unlike Gohmert, noted this in his piece that his analysis doesn’t "delve into employee contributions to candidates for the House and Senate." That means Franc’s study covers a much narrower slice of the data than one would assume just by hearing from Gohmert’s comment. When we reached Franc -- now an aide to House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. -- he didn’t defend the specific language Gohmert used. But he said he believes Gohmert’s underlying point -- that affluent "elites" lean Democratic, despite the party’s attacks "the rich" -- is fair. "If he mixed up the statistics in some way, it is the broader point that matters," Franc said. "Elites behave politically far differently than the conventional wisdom says they do. … The Democrats still overperform politically in congressional districts with heavy concentrations of wealth and post-graduate education." Our ruling Gohmert said that "80 percent of Wall Street executives and their spouses' donations go to Democrats." Gohmert would have had a stronger argument if he’d said that was the case six years ago, when candidate Barack Obama was vacuuming up Wall Street donations. The problem is, that’s no longer true. In fact, the exact opposite pattern has held for Wall Street donations during the past three election cycles. In addition, Gohmert overstated Franc’s percentages and ignored the difference between donations to Democratic presidential candidates and congressional candidates. We rate his claim False.

pomt-10538	Clinton said "great things about NAFTA until she started running for president."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/25/barack-obama/clinton-has-changed-on-nafta/	In Ohio, where union workers are a major presence and the manufacturing economy is hurting, Sen. Barack Obama attacked Sen. Hillary Clinton for her position on the North American Free Trade Agreement, called NAFTA. "Yesterday, Sen. Clinton also said I'm wrong to point out that she once supported NAFTA," Obama said. "But the fact is, she was saying great things about NAFTA until she started running for president. A couple years after it passed, she said NAFTA was a 'free and fair trade agreement' and that it was 'proving its worth.' And in 2004, she said, 'I think, on balance, NAFTA has been good for New York state and America.' " The Clinton campaign says Obama is wrong, that Clinton was critical of NAFTA "long before she started running for president." We looked into Clinton's past remarks on NAFTA and concluded that she has changed her tune, from once speaking favorably about it to now saying the agreement needs "fixing." The agreement goes back to the 1992 presidential campaign when Bill Clinton ran against incumbent President George H.W. Bush. On Aug. 12 of that year, Bush finished negotiating NAFTA with Mexico and Canada. During the campaign, Bill Clinton said he would support NAFTA if elected, but would demand supplemental agreements to protect worker rights, the environment and sudden import surges. After Clinton won the presidency, his administration negotiated the side agreements and made NAFTA one of its top priorities. Vice President Al Gore memorably debated Ross Perot about NAFTA on CNN's "Larry King Live." Congress approved the agreements, and it was hailed as a major political victory for the new president. As first lady, Hillary Clinton publicly supported her husband's position. In 1996, in a visit with unionized garment workers, she said the words Obama now quotes. "I think everybody is in favor of free and fair trade. I think NAFTA is proving its worth," said Clinton, according to an Associated Press report. Clinton wrote positively of her husband's efforts on NAFTA in her memoir "Living History," published in 2003: "Creating a free trade zone in North America — the largest free trade zone in the world — would expand U.S. exports, create jobs and ensure that our economy was reaping the benefits, not the burdens, of globalization. Although unpopular with labor unions, expanding trade opportunities was an important administration goal." During a 2004 teleconference on funding cuts for job training, Clinton was asked whether NAFTA should be revisited. She replied, "I think that we have to enforce the trade rules that are inherent" in NAFTA. "I think on balance NAFTA has been good for New York and America, but I also think that there are a number of areas where we're not dealt with in an upfront way in dealing with our friend to the north, Canada, which seems to be able to come up with a number of rationales for keeping New York agricultural products out of Canada," she said. Today, Clinton's campaign Web site says plainly, "NAFTA was negotiated more than 14 years ago, and Hillary believes it has not lived up to its promises." At a debate hosted by CNN in November 2007, Clinton said, "NAFTA was a mistake to the extent that it did not deliver on what we had hoped it would, and that's why I call for a trade timeout." We should note that Clinton biographer Sally Bedell Smith has said that as first lady, Clinton opposed NAFTA privately but supported it publicly because it was important to her husband politically. However, this is not a point Clinton made in her own autobiography, where she wrote in favor of NAFTA. Now, there's the issue of whether Clinton changed her mind because she was running for president. Clinton surrogates say she made remarks against NAFTA as early as March 2000 when she was running for Senate in New York. We could not confirm those remarks independently. But, as we've noted, she made pro-NAFTA remarks as late as 2003 (her autobiography) and 2004 (a teleconference). We won't say Clinton was a huge cheerleader for NAFTA, but she did speak favorably of it. And now she says it needs to be fixed. Was running for president the cause of this switch, or was it a gradual change of thinking? It's hard to say; the balance of evidence does not point to a harsh pivot point. But when we balance her previous statements against her more recent statements, we find that she has changed her sentiments when she speaks about NAFTA. We rate Obama's charge True.

pomt-00562	Says "Florida is a model" for successful pretrial release programs.	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2015/jun/12/john-oliver/john-oliver-hails-pretrial-services-florida-progre/	Poking fun at Florida is oh-so-easy. So HBO host and news-comedian John Oliver surprised us, and maybe even himself, on Last Week Tonight when he hailed Florida as a model for the country for a component of its judicial system — and not for, say, assaults with a slice of pizza, or something like that. Oliver criticized the money-bail system that exists throughout most of the country in his June 7 episode, saying it leaves people who are too poor to make bail for non-violent offenses behind bars, which drives up jail costs and destroys livelihoods. As an alternative, Oliver made the case for pretrial service programs. With these services, he said, a person who is arrested would be interviewed by a specialist to see if he or she poses a flight risk or is dangerous. The specialist makes a recommendation to a judge, and the judge decides whether to send the person home, where he or she may be monitored with drug tests, ankle monitors and phone calls about court dates. "And pretrial service programs have succeeded around the country in places ranging from Oregon to Florida," Oliver said. "And it is a truly frightening state of affairs when Florida is a model for progressive change." He added, "Did you know by the way that under Florida law, if you possess over 5 grams of meth, you can marry it. That’s a fact. That’s a legal fact. That’s an actual photo that ran in a newspaper’s wedding section in Florida. And yet even counties in Florida recognize that our money bail system is broken." As he described that "fact," this image appeared: For the record, it is not a "legal fact" that you can marry meth in Florida. That was a joke. However, we did want to unpack his more serious claim that Florida is a "model for progressive change" for its successful pretrial release programs. That wasn’t meant to be a joke. Oliver’s staff did not comment for this fact-check. Pretrial justice experts we consulted said while Florida has some positive things going for it, calling it a nationwide model is a bit of a stretch. Cherise Fanno Burdeen is executive director of the Pretrial Justice Institute, which supports alternatives to money bail. (The institute is also petitioning Gov. Andrew Cuomo to end New York’s money bail system after the suicide of Kalief Browder, who was kept in Rikers Island prison for three years without trial in part because he could not make bail after being accused of stealing a backpack). Burdeen, who said she spoke to Oliver’s team before the show, said she would not have hailed Florida as a progressive pretrial services model. Washington, D.C., and Kentucky, yes. Oregon and Colorado, sure. But Florida? "That’s probably not a statement I would make," Burdeen said. "It’s definitely more nuanced." In the mid 1970s, amid national reforms, some Florida counties started pretrial service programs — mainly because of jail overcrowding. Programs exist today in 29 of 67 counties. Not all states have done that, Burdeen said. But Florida does not offer pretrial services statewide, and "it certainly has a long way to go in terms of other needed components of reform," she said. One example: Only a few counties use accredited standards for assessing an arrested person’s flight risk and danger to the community before trial. The counties that are accredited by the Florida Corrections Accreditation Commission are Alachua, Broward, Lee, Miami-Dade, Orange and Volusia, which combined are home to 7.2 million residents, or 36 percent of the state's estimated population. Florida could be considered loosely "progressive," Burdeen said, because pretrial programs exist in most counties where the vast majority of criminal case filings happen. In 2013, Miami-Dade County served more than 10,500 people, Broward County served more than 6,000, and Palm Beach, Polk and Pinellas counties served more than 5,000, according to the annual report of pretrial service programs in the state by the Florida Legislature's Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability. The point of the bail system is to ensure a defendant showed up for court, and sometimes the only way to do it is to keep him or her in jail, said Bob Dekle, University of Florida College of Law legal skills professor. "Florida’s model for pretrial detention and release is a fair, equitable model," he said. "I don’t know that it’s on the outer fringes of the avant garde in turning people loose from jail, and I rather doubt it, but I don’t believe that it is regressive. It’s just there and that’s what it is." For virtually all crimes except capital offenses, Florida law says the presumption of release should be on nonmonetary conditions. Still, Burdeen said most counties rely on a bond schedule for crimes. "If you can pay it out, you get out, if not you go to first appearance," she said. "Almost without a doubt the judge continues that amount from the schedule; if not, you back to your cell." Experts also pointed out that "pretrial services" means something different depending on the jurisdiction. In Florida’s Monroe County, home of the Florida Keys, pretrial services workers interview defendants, review their criminal histories and develop recommendations for a judge based on a point-scoring system that helps determine if they should be released on their own recognizance or released under supervision of the pretrial services agency. The judge can also choose to set a money bond amount. In Pinellas County, pretrial services are not run by a court or a county agency — they're run through the sheriff's office. When someone is arrested, booking deputies have the option of setting a recommended bond for an offense or a higher or lower bond depending on the circumstances. Often the low bond is to release the defendant at the jail on his or her own recognizance, known as ROR. If a defendant remains in jail until the first appearance, the judge could still decide to change the booking deputy's bond or recommend unsupervised or supervised ROR, which could include check-ins or electronic monitoring. When a judge is unsure, pretrial services staffers can conduct their own investigation into a defendant's background and advise the judge accordingly. "It's a very, very useful tool to manage the jail population," said Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri. Spurgeon Kennedy, National Association of Pretrial Services Agencies vice president, said the vast majority of American counties do not have pretrial programs, so the fact that Florida has some is a positive in his group’s view. That said, the money-bail system remains prevalent and powerful throughout the state. "Unfortunately, Florida uses money primarily, and that’s the reason why we would hesitate to say what is happening in Florida is a model," Kennedy said. "But you do have these programs." Kennedy would look elsewhere for states closer to pretrial service utopia. In Washington, D.C., as Oliver also highlighted, the Pretrial Services Agency helps judges in the D.C. Superior Court and U.S. District Court by recommending release conditions for defendants that are based on their circumstances and are usually non-financial. And Kentucky abolished its commercial bail system in 1976, relying instead on a single statewide agency employing pretrial officers who interview people in jail and facilitate their release. Our ruling Oliver said "pretrial service programs have succeeded around the country," namely Florida, adding, "And it is a truly frightening state of affairs when Florida is a model for progressive change." Experts in pretrial justice, several of whom talked with Oliver’s staff, said certain counties within Florida have demonstrated success with pretrial services as a way to reduce jail costs and eliminate overcrowding in jails. But they said he went a bit too far in leaving his viewers with the idea that Florida is among states that go above and beyond for defendants. There are pockets of progress, advocates said, but the commercial bail bonding industry is also strong in the state, and not every county has pretrial services. Oliver’s claim rates claim Half True.

pomt-01159	"Bill Howell has been the consistent force behind every major tax increase in Virginia in the last decade."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2014/dec/15/susan-stimpson/susan-stimpson-says-bill-howell-has-been-force-beh/	Susan Stimpson, former chairwoman of the Stafford County Board of Supervisors, recently announced her candidacy for the House of Delegates, challenging House Speaker William Howell in next year’s Republican primary. She said Howell, who has led the House since 2003, has abandoned conservatives. "Bill Howell has been the consistent force behind every major tax increase in Virginia in the last decade," she said in a Dec. 2 news release. "He has voted for them, he has engineered them and they are his legacy. Simply put, Bill Howell has lost his way and is the chief architect of a tax-and-spend agenda that rewards the politicians and punishes the middle class." It would be no small feat for Howell to be the force behind every state tax increase of the last decade and still manage to be re-elected as speaker every two years by the House’s Republican majority. So we examined Stimpson’s claim. Tim Edson, Stimpson’s spokesman, sent us vote records, news releases and articles that cover three major tax increase bills in 2004, 2007 and 2013. So let’s enter the Wayback Machine. 2004 Gov. Mark Warner proposed a $700 million a year tax increase to bolster education, public safety and health programs. The Senate went a few leaps further, adding transportation to the mix and approving a tax hike of almost $2 billion a year. Howell voiced opposition to both plans but never voted on them. The transportation bill was killed in the House Finance Committee. The tax standoff led to 115-day impasse in passing a two-year state budget. It was broken after moderate House Republicans crafted a compromise bill for a $615 million tax increase. The bill faced a major hurdle on April 6 when it came before the House Finance Committee. Stimpson points to articles in several newspapers the next day saying the legislation passed on a 10-8 vote after the Howell persuaded four anti-tax Republicans on the panel to skip the meeting. The speaker had been under pressure to allow the full House an opportunity to vote on the measure and, at the time, there appeared to ample votes to still kill it on the floor. A week later, however, the House approved the tax increase on a 52-46 vote when 17 rebellious Republicans joined forces with Democrats. Howell voted against the bill. The tax hike went on to pass the Senate and was signed by Warner. Howell would later strip three Republicans leaders of the tax compromise of some of their appointments to powerful committees and state commissions. 2007 Howell sponsored legislation to raise about $500 million a year for transportation, most of it by diverting funds that had helped pay for other services. But $158 million of the sum would come from raising fees on drivers and imposing heavy penalties on chronically bad drivers. The bill also gave Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads power to raise a combined $600 million more by establishing transportation commissions in their regions that would be authorized to raise taxes. Although the General Assembly approved the legislation, it had short-lived success. Less than a year later, lawmakers repealed the new penalties of bad drivers -- which could exceed $1,000 -- amid a public outcry. And the state Supreme Court struck down the regional transportation authorities, ruling that the legislature cannot delegate taxing power to unelected bodies. 2013 Howell sponsored a successful bill to raise about $750 million annually for transportation. Most of the money comes from a new tax on the wholesale price of gas, an increase in the state sales tax from 5 percent to 5.3 percent, and an increase in the motor vehicle sales tax from 3 percent to 4.3 percent. The bill also imposed a series of regional tax increases in Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads -- including an 0.7 percent sales tax hike -- to help the congested areas raise a combined $680 million a year for transportation. Howell said he carried the bill to improve the safety of Virginia roads and because he was concerned transportation problems could undercut Virginia’s ability to recruit new corporations and retain the ones already here. Half of the 66 Republicans in the House voted for the measure, which was also backed by then-Gov. Bob McDonnell, also a Republican. Matt Moran, a spokesman for Howell, reminded us there were several large proposed tax hikes that the speaker opposed. Indeed, records show that Howell either voted or spoke out against $1 billion-plus tax increases former Gov. Tim Kaine unsuccessfully sought in 2006, 2008 and 2010. Our ruling Stimpson says "Howell has been the consistent force behind every major tax increase in Virginia in the last decade." She’s right on the transportation tax bills that were passed in 2007 and 2013. Howell sponsored the measures and encouraged fellow House Republicans to vote for them. There’s complexity to the speaker’s role in the passage of the 2004 tax increase for education, public safety and health programs. Howell consistently spoke out against the bill and voted against it. But the bill survived a hostile House committee because Howell persuaded four conservative allies to skip the vote. This was a political miscalculation by the speaker rather than a nod of support. Howell was under pressure to let the full House vote on the measure. He was outmaneuvered a week later when 17 Republicans joined Democrats to narrowly pass the tax hike. Howell retaliated by stripping leaders of the GOP revolt of some duties. So we find Stimpson’s statement accurate, but in need of this clarification: Howell was an unwitting force behind one of the tax increases. We rate Stimpson’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-05002	Says Mitt Romney’s carried interest income was a tax "trick."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/18/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-mitt-romney-received-carried-int/	President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign continues to press the point that Mitt Romney made a lot of money in ways that most people don’t. On July 17, 2012, the campaign unveiled an ad in Pennsylvania, a swing state where Romney was making an appearance. The ad begins with a narrator saying, "Tax havens, offshore accounts, and carried interest. Mitt Romney has used every trick in the book." The last item in the list -- carried interest, which refers to a type of income typically earned by managers of hedge funds and private-equity firms -- caught our eye. We wondered whether the Obama camp was justified in calling carried interest a tax-limitation "trick." This one is a little technical, so we'll break it into pieces. What is carried interest? Private-equity firms (which buy, invest in, help manage and eventually sell companies) and hedge funds (which invest in a wide variety of markets) are run by managers on behalf of outside investors. When profits from a firm’s investments are disbursed, they are typically distributed according to each investor's stake. This income is taxed on each individual’s tax return, usually at the capital-gains rate of 15 percent. Fund managers may receive some income this way, but there’s a separate stream of income that is usually more lucrative for them. They often take 2 percent of the fund’s assets per year as a management fee, which is paid in cash and taxed at ordinary income rates of 35 percent, plus 20 percent of the profits as a performance-based bonus. The 20 percent portion is typically "carried over" for years at a time, often until the investment is closed out (thus the name, "carried interest"). This payment is taxed at capital gains rates of 15 percent -- less than if it were salary or wages. The hefty tax rate advantage for carried interest has spawned criticism. In the 2008 campaign, Obama promised to tax carried interest at the same rate as regular income, an effort we currently rate Stalled on our Obameter. The Congressional Research Service says the dispute boils down to opposing views of what carried interest represents. Obama and his allies say carried interest is essentially a management fee rather than investment profits from an ownership stake, and should be taxed like regular income. Opponents say it’s more like like investment income. It should not be surprising that Romney had carried interest income, since he co-founded and ran Bain Capital -- a private-equity firm. But this point was confirmed in an on-the-record call the Romney campaign set up with journalists on Jan. 24, 2012. Ben Ginsberg, an attorney for the Romney campaign, said on the conference call that "the amount from carried interest" earned by Romney "was $7.4 million in 2010 and $5.5 million in 2011." By having that income taxed at 15 percent rather than 35 percent meant that Romney may have saved more than over $2.5 million in taxes. Is carried interest a "trick"? We found differing opinions about whether it's accurate to describe it as "a trick." Some tax experts told us they think Obama’s use of the term "trick" is fair, because carried interest is a way to limit taxes that’s essentially limited to the very wealthy. "Given that the word ‘trick’ has no specific legal meaning in this context, I think it's fair game to call this one of the ‘tricks’ in the book," said Neil H. Buchanan, a law professor at George Washington University. "Each technique is different, and is used for a different specific tax advantage, but they're all among the list of things that wealthy people have at their disposal to cut their tax bills, that other people do not have available to them." Several other tax experts, however, thought the Obama camp went too far in using that term and in lumping carried interest together with tax havens and offshore accounts. They said the taxation of carried interest involves a pretty straightforward application of U.S. tax law. Offshore accounts and tax havens, by contrast, operate in the spaces between U.S. tax law, rather than as part of it. While there’s a dispute over whether the tax treatment of carried interest is smart policy, its legal standing is solid. Carried interest is a longstanding part of the tax code and applies in several areas of investment including real estate and gas and oil. Second, some argued that taxing carried interest as capital gains promotes entrepreneurial activity. Steve Judge, the president of the Private Equity Growth Capital Council, a trade group for private equity funds, said carried interest is a way to reward risk takers in a way that tax havens do not. "They don’t have the purpose of incentivizing risk taking," Judge said. "That makes it inappropriate to blend carried interest with them." And third, carried interest isn’t really a tax strategy in the same way that using offshore accounts or tax havens is. Creating offshore accounts in tax havens can be put into effect quickly, if you are rich enough. As the Congressional Research Service notes, "The individual, using the Internet, can open a bank account in the name of a Cayman corporation that can be set up for a minimal fee. Money can be electronically transferred without any reporting to tax authorities, and investments can be made in the United States or abroad." But to benefit from the taxation of carried interest, you have to become a fund manager -- something that doesn’t happen overnight. It’s a career choice years in the making. Not even a fund’s investors get the benefits of carried interest -- it’s only the fund managers themselves. Lawrence J. White, an economist at the Stern School of Business at New York University, said that as long as they are legal, none of the three techniques cited by the ad are really "tricks." "Carried interest is currently a legitimate way of reducing one's tax obligation," he said. "It may be unfair and distortionary; but it's not any more a ‘trick’ than taking advantage of the mortgage interest deduction. Congress ought to change the law so that carried interest is taxed at regular income rates. But until then. …" Our ruling The Obama campaign said Romney's use of carried interest is a "trick," but we find that's an exaggeration. "Trick" suggests something nefarious or twisting the tax code in a way that wasn't intended. But we found little to back that up. Using carried interes ist a legal, well-established part of the tax code that can’t be marshaled to dodge taxes by making a few quick mouse clicks on a Cayman Island website. We rate the ad’s claim Mostly False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-07-18T11:58:09	2012-07-17	['None']
pomt-03351	Says in Texas "it's legal to shoot someone who's committing a ‘public nuisance’ under the cover of dark."	false	/texas/statements/2013/jul/18/robert-reich/robert-reich-says-its-legal-texas-shoot-someone-cr/	Discussing the divide between states red and blue, former U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich recently said that Texans are allowed to shoot people who are causing a nuisance. "If you want to use a gun to kill someone who’s, say, spraypainting a highway underpass at night," Reich wrote in a June 8, 2013, blog post at robertreich.org, "you might want to go to Texas, where it’s legal to shoot someone who’s committing a ‘public nuisance’ under the cover of dark." Reich, who headed the Labor Department under President Bill Clinton, has a law degree and is now a University of California-Berkeley professor of public policy. He told us by email that he was referring to a June 5, 2013, verdict that got national news coverage, in which a San Antonio jury acquitted a man of murder in the death of an escort he hired from an online advertisement. San Antonio Express-News and KSAT-TV news reports on the trial said defendant Ezekiel Gilbert testified that he had found Lenora Ivie Frago’s ad on Craigslist and believed sex was included in her $150 fee. Instead, she left after about 20 minutes, saying she had to give the money to her driver, Gilbert testified. The driver pulled away and Gilbert shot at the car with an assault rifle. Frago was hit and paralyzed, dying six months later when her family took her off artificial respiration. Gilbert's defense team argued that his actions were justified because he was trying to retrieve stolen property. They said that Frago misled Gilbert when they arranged the transaction, making her refusal to have sex or return his money into theft. Reich disagreed. "Failure to perform a service that is illegal -- kidnapping a baby, bribing a legislator, delivering cocaine, or providing sex for money -- is not a theft," he said. "Anyone exercising common sense would understand that this was at most a contractual dispute over what he paid for and what she owed him in return," he said, later adding, "It must be that the jury regarded prostitution as a crime, warranting the use of deadly force. But since prostitution is not a crime warranting the use of deadly force -- it is typically prosecuted under nuisance laws," the verdict means "it is permissible in Texas to shoot someone who commits a public nuisance." In his initial emails to us, Reich said this was the only way to interpret the verdict. He later switched to saying it is "one way" to view the decision. Legal experts and Gilbert’s defense lawyer disagreed with him. Bobby Barrera, a defense lawyer for Gilbert, said Reich "is flat wrong and not even arguably close to accurate on the interpretation of the law." The law in question is state Penal Code Title 2, Chapter 9, Section 42, which says using deadly force to protect one’s property is justified in limited circumstances, including when the person "reasonably believes" such force is necessary to prevent imminent "theft during the nighttime" or "criminal mischief during the nighttime." Jurors concluded that the "theft" justification applied in this case, Barrera told us by phone, because testimony indicated Frago and her driver had a history of taking money from clients who believed they would receive sex in return. "She was committing a scam," he said. Even then, Barrera said, the jury had to find other conditions were met, such as requirements that Gilbert reasonably believed he couldn’t get his money back any other way or without risking injury to himself. "It is not open season on prostitutes" or thieves in Texas, Barrera said. "This has gone, as you know, viral with ‘It’s legal to shoot prostitutes in Texas,’ ‘Stupid Texans and their guns,’ " he said. "Nobody wanted to know the truth; they just wanted to conclude what they wanted." As to shooting someone for committing a public nuisance, Barrera said, "You cannot under any circumstances do so." University of Texas law professor George Dix, who specializes in criminal law, told us by email, "Reich, in my view, is simply wrong." Frago and Gilbert’s transaction would be theft, Dix said, if Frago did not intend to provide sex at the time she made the agreement with Gilbert. "What would make this criminal and not merely a civil contract dispute is the misrepresentation by which Frago obtained the money," he said. "In fact, anyone with a basic knowledge of theft law would understand that this could have been theft rather than ‘just’ a contractual dispute," Dix said. "It could be theft under Section 31.02 of the Penal Code if the deceased promised to provide sex for the payment and at that time did not intend to provide that sex if she was paid." Even so, he said, "The jury might not have been convinced this actually was theft, but also convinced the state did not prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that it was not theft." That’s two legal eagles saying that, contrary to Reich’s assertion, the jury didn’t have to consider prostitution as a reason for justifying deadly force. Even if prostitution had been a crucial point, it’s not a "public nuisance" in Texas law. It’s classified under "public indecency" in Penal Code Title 9, Section 43.02. Public nuisances can be much lesser offenses such as creating noise, Texas District and County Attorneys Association spokesman Clay Abbott told us by phone. Reich’s example of the highway spraypainter bridges the gap: "Spraypainting would be both a public nuisance and criminal mischief," Abbott said. Even if the offense were serious, he said, a jury would have to decide that other conditions were met. To justify deadly force in protecting a third person’s property -- namely, the overpass -- the damage being halted must be so extreme it could never be repaired; the shooter must have no other way to stop the spraypainter without risking injury and must have reasonably believed deadly force was the only way to stop the spraypainter. Spraypaint can be removed or painted over, so the example falls down right there, Abbott said. "It’s a ridiculous statement." Dix said, "I stress this is not an example of a rule that in Texas one can ‘shoot someone who’s committing a "public nuisance" under the cover of dark.’ It is an example of a Texas rule providing broadly (and probably unwisely) that one can use even deadly force to protect property from loss or damage." Like Dix and Barrera, Abbott told us Reich is wrong to say Texans can use deadly force on someone committing a public nuisance. They also emphasized that the existence of a possible legal defense does not mean the shooter would be acquitted or that shooting criminals is the right thing to do. One final point: We wondered why the law specified "during the nighttime." Abbott speculated it was a holdover from English common law. Many states once had definitions of burglary with a stipulation about nighttime, which William Blackstone’s 18th-century analysis of English law said makes the crime more serious not so much because daylight is lacking but because "sleep has disarmed the owner, and rendered his castle defenceless." Our ruling Reich said that in Texas, "it's legal to shoot someone who's committing a ‘public nuisance’ under the cover of dark," claiming that a recent acquittal hinged on prostitution, that prostitution was a form of public nuisance, and that therefore it’s legal to shoot people creating a nuisance. Legal experts and a lawyer in the murder trial told us Reich was wrong. The verdict hinged on theft; prostitution is not a "public nuisance" in Texas; and state law doesn’t say deadly force can be used on people creating nuisances. Notably, too, the law includes many other restrictions on deadly force, not just what type of crime is being committed. We rate the statement as False.

pomt-03015	A congressional laundry closed due to the partial government shutdown.	true	/texas/statements/2013/oct/14/roger-williams/capitol-hill-closures-due-partial-government-shutd/	A Texas congressman said he’s running low on shirts due to the partial shutdown of the federal government that took effect Oct. 1, 2013. An Oct. 11, 2013, Austin American-Statesman news article on the views of Austin U.S. Reps. Roger Williams, a Republican, and Lloyd Doggett, a Democrat, quoted Williams as saying that he favors spending cuts and opposes an increase in the federal debt limit. Williams also indicated he’s not happy about the shutdown. "I didn’t want the government to shut down, I didn’t get my laundry out" of the congressional laundry before it shut down, Williams said. Doggett said he didn’t know there was a congressional laundry. We’re here to serve. Did the federal shutdown also shutter a congressional laundry? By email, spokeswomen for Williams and Doggett each said a dry cleaning store housed in a Capitol office building shut its doors due to the government shutdown. Williams spokeswoman Haley Graves said: "The laundry is just a local laundry/dry cleaning branch that’s located on the Capitol complex and open to the public. It was closed due to the shutdown, so anyone who dropped off suits/shirts/alterations before Oct. 1 aren’t able to get them out at this time." Doggett spokeswoman Kelsey Crow agreed the basement laundry, which we identified as ClassiCleaners in the Longworth House Office Building, closed due to the shutdown. A web search led us to a Feb. 23, 2010, article in American Drycleaner, a trade publication, stating the House had chosen ClassiCleaners "as its new, official ‘green’ drycleaning service provider." Crow also emailed us a photo (posted above) showing what looks like the door to a ClassiCleaners store with two signs, one saying "Closed" and the other stating: "Due to the government shutdown, this facility is closed." We repeatedly telephoned the ClassiCleaners and every time got disconnected. But a search of The Washington Post led us to a Sept. 26, 2013, post on the newspaper’s Federal Eye blog stating that if the federal shutdown occurred, Capitol Hill "service providers" required to close would include stationery stores, "the dry cleaners" and other offices. The article linked to undated web pages overseen by the House Administration Committee including one forecasting the open/closed status of Capitol facilities in the event of a government shutdown. According to the committee, the House "cleaners" would be open from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Oct. 3, 2013, which we took as an indication it otherwise would be closed. According to the committee’s page, the House stationery, gift, beauty and barber shops also were to be closed. Our ruling Williams said a congressional laundry was closed due to the government shutdown. Save for a few hours the first Thursday of October, the House’s official cleaners was closed in connection with the partial government shutdown. We rate this claim as True.

pomt-14108	Says President Obama’s deal "allows Iran to produce a nuclear weapon."	false	/florida/statements/2016/may/11/carlos-beruff/deal-allows-iran-produce-nuclear-weapon-us-senate-/	Bradenton developer Carlos Beruff lobbed a bombshell against his Democratic opponents and the White House: President Barack Obama’s deal with Iran actually allows that country to build a nuclear weapon. The Manatee County Republican criticized the president’s negotiation skills and berated U.S. Reps. Alan Grayson and Patrick Murphy for backing the deal. Grayson and Murphy are squaring off in the Democratic primary, while Beruff faces a packed GOP field. "Both Congressman Grayson and Congressman Murphy supported President Obama’s disastrous deal, which allows Iran to produce a nuclear weapon," Beruff said in a May 5, 2016, news release. Beruff’s argument gave us pause, since the idea of the Iran nuclear agreement was ostensibly made to prevent the country from building a nuke. When we rechecked the terms of the deal for this fact-check, we found that was still the case. The deal’s terms The deal, which was struck in July 2015, essentially lifts international economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for the nation agreeing to curb nuclear technologies and allowing nuclear-weapons inspections for 10 to 25 years. A sticking point for critics is that while Iran has to give up 97 percent of its enriched uranium stockpile and most of its centrifuges that could enrich more, that capability is not gone entirely. Iran can have a reduced number of operating centrifuges for 10 years, but research and development on advanced centrifuges will be limited. Uranium enrichment is supposed to be kept at levels unsuitable for weapons use for the next 15 years. Iran also can no longer produce plutonium, the other element that could create a bomb. To make sure Iran is doing what it agreed to do, international inspectors will monitor known nuclear sites for those 15 years. They also can enter an undeclared site suspected of nuclear use, although Iran could take up to 24 days to allow inspectors into such sites. There’s been plenty of debate about how verifiable such activity can be. Surveillance of centrifuge production areas is slated to last 20 years, and uranium mills and mines will be monitored for 25 years. Iran also has to stick to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that it signed in 1974, thereby no longer pursuing nuclear weapons. It must follow further international treaties, as well. Theoretically, Iran must abide by those treaties for good, even after the 25-year inspection time limit passes. Several experts have told PolitiFact over the last few months that as long as Iran adheres to the terms of the agreement, they cannot build a nuclear weapon. Opponents (like Beruff) say that all this does is delay a bomb, not prevent it. "The deal legitimatizes Iran’s nuclear program," Beruff campaign spokesman Chris Hartline said in an email. "It allows Iran to continue to enrich uranium and to ramp up enrichment down the road, while also giving the country access to tens of billions of dollars." Hartline further said that reported missile tests in March 2016 (which Iran has denied happening) prove that Iran will undoubtedly cheat on the deal. Some experts have said it’s reasonable to suspect Iran could disregard the agreement and again pursue a weapon. But even if the United States had won tougher terms, any agreement only works if the country follows the guidelines. Not coming to an agreement at all would have let Iran’s militarized nuclear progress continue unabated. A key mechanism of the agreement is that it lengthened Iran’s "breakout time" — how long it would take Iran to produce a nuclear weapon if it returned to building one. While some estimates put that time at two to three months before the deal, the breakout time is generally considered to be about a year under the terms of the deal. "It does not have the uranium enrichment capacity to produce enough bomb-grade material," said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association. "It would take over a year. We would detect any attempt to do that within weeks, if not days." Richard Nephew, a research scholar and program director for economic statecraft, sanctions and energy markets at Columbia University, told PolitiFact last year that the deal definitely impedes Iran’s nuclear program. "Fifteen years of restrictions and upwards of 20 years of enhanced inspections will hardly facilitate an Iranian nuclear weapon," he said. Our ruling Beruff said Obama’s deal "allows Iran to produce a nuclear weapon." He makes it sound as if the agreement formally blesses Iran’s pursuit of nuclear weapons. But it doesn’t. The terms of the deal expressly forbid pursuing a militarized nuclear program. There are limits on uranium enrichment and facility uses, and Iran must agree to inspections. It also must abide by terms of international treaties to not seek weapons even after the deal’s guidelines end. To develop nuclear weapons, Iran would have to either break the terms of the agreement or else wait it out and start building one anew once the deal’s provisions have expired (which would be counter to the provisions of treaties that predated this deal). Either way, that doesn’t sound like an agreement that "allows Iran to produce a nuclear weapon." We rate the statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ea547399-2c45-4d1f-8979-1075a76a36e4	None	Carlos Beruff	None	None	None	2016-05-11T12:39:22	2016-05-05	['Iran', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-02038	New carbon regulations will increase electric bills by "$17 billion every year" and "potentially put an average of 224,000 more people out of work every year."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/02/john-boehner/Boehner-says-Obama-climate-change-jobs-bills-costs/	President Barack Obama’s administration unveiled tough new regulations on existing power plants that seek to significantly curb carbon emissions in the coming decades. Moments after the proposal was released, it was widely panned by Republicans, who called it a continuation of Obama’s so-called "War on Coal" and said it would kill jobs, raise electric prices and hurt the economy. On his website, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, put it in more direct terms: "The president’s plan would indeed cause a surge in electricity bills — costs stand to go up $17 billion every year. But it would also shut down plants and potentially put an average of 224,000 more people out of work every year." The details of Obama’s plan are extensive — the proposal is 645 pages long. So how did Republicans come up with such exact (and damning) figures so quickly after the proposal was released? The estimates actually come from a U.S. Chamber of Commerce study that was released in late May. We took a look at it last week, and noted it made several assumptions about the June 2 proposal. We warned that the findings of the study would be relatively unusable if those predictions did not come to light. And that’s what happened. The Environmental Protection Agency announced a goal of reducing carbon emissions 30 percent (based on 2005 levels) by 2030. This is achieved in part by creating carbon caps for each state and providing options for them to reach their targets, including regional "cap and trade" networks, investing in renewable energy and smart grid technology, and eventually phasing out many existing coal plants. But the chamber study that Boehner and other Republicans cite assumed that the Obama administration would want to decrease carbon emissions by 42 percent — not 30 percent — before 2030 (a number Obama first suggested in 2009 during the Copenhagen international climate change talks). When it comes to the pace for reducing CO2 levels, this is a significant difference. This is a point even the chamber made to PolitiFact now that Obama’s regulations have been released. "We were never saying those were the numbers for any scenario other than the ones that we put forward," said Matt Letourneau, spokesman for the Institute for 21st Century Energy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. "Now that we have a different benchmark, we’re taking a look at the rule and the analysis and the model and we’ll see what we can do (to update the study)." Why don’t the numbers work? By assuming a much more difficult goal, the chamber also predicted that by 2022, the EPA (under a different president) will have to change course to meet the 42 percent threshold. The only means to accomplish this, the chamber concluded, was to force new natural gas plants to use carbon capture and storage technology. In September, the EPA said new natural gas plants would not need to include carbon capture in their facilities. A large chunk of the chamber’s estimated costs of the carbon rules comes from the assumption that new natural gas plants will require carbon capture technology, which they say is 50 percent more expensive to build and also more expensive to operate. Therefore, their assumption that power companies face $478 billion in compliance costs — $339 billion from construction — is likely overblown. Letourneau and Boehner’s office both noted media reports that said the 30 percent threshold could be increased before the final regulations are approved. (Of course, it could also be lowered, too.) There will be a 120-day public comment period before the EPA releases its final draft. There are other criticisms of the chamber study. For example, it did not factor in the cost of no action, which the EPA said is significant. The debate over the cost of these regulations will continue, and we do not dismiss offhand the idea that new regulations on existing power plants have an economic cost. For its part, the EPA says that the new rules will save consumers money on their electric bills and will spur economic growth that will surpass the expense. But even if the regulations do have an economic cost, it’s misleading to quote estimates from a study that wrongly assumed a key piece of the EPA’s proposal. Our ruling Boehner said the EPA’s plan to regulate carbon emissions in existing power plants will increase electric bills by "$17 billion every year" and "potentially put an average of 224,000 more people out of work every year." Those numbers are based on a U.S. Chamber of Commerce study that came out before the EPA announced the regulations on existing power plants. That study wrongly assumed the administration would set a benchmark of reducing carbon emissions by 42 percent before 2030. The regulations released June 2 actually put forward a 30 percent reduction within that timeframe. The chamber itself told PolitiFact its estimates are not based on the goals as announced. But despite these serious flaws, Boehner used the numbers anyway. We rate his statement False.	None	John Boehner	None	None	None	2014-06-02T17:28:42	2014-06-02	['None']
pomt-14474	Says Donald Trump has said "he would be neutral between Israel and its enemies."	half-true	/florida/statements/2016/mar/01/conservative-solutions-pac/would-donald-trump-be-neutral-between-israel-and-i/	A political action committee supporting Marco Rubio portrays Donald Trump as not being in the Israel fan club. In a TV ad running in Florida, a screen shot shows a man wearing a bandana featuring what appears to be Arabic letters holding a rocket-propelled grenade. Trump "says he would be neutral between Israel and its enemies," says the Conservative Solutions PAC ad. Is that accurate? Trump did make a statement about being "neutral" in negotiations between Israel and Palestinians, but the ad omits other statements Trump made in support of Israel. Trump’s position on Israel at a town hall and debate The ad cites the MSNBC town hall with Trump in South Carolina on Feb. 17. (A spokesman for the super PAC cited Trump’s comments at the town hall and at a subsequent debate.) MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough asked Trump whether Israelis or Palestinians were at fault for a lack of an agreement. So far, efforts have failed to work out a lasting comprehensive agreement on issues such as security, land claims, whether Israel can build settlements and recognizing each other’s right to exist. Trump refused to pick a side, saying that would hurt his ability to serve as a negotiator. "Let me be sort of a neutral guy .... I don't want to say whose fault is it. I don't think it helps." About two weeks later at the debate in Houston, Wolf Blitzer asked Trump: "How do you remain neutral when the U.S. considers Israel to be America's closest ally in the Middle East?" Trump defended his record by saying that he had been grand marshall of the Israeli Day parade a few years ago and received awards from Israel. But he said when negotiating a deal, it wouldn’t help to pick a good guy and a bad guy: "It doesn't help if I start saying, 'I am very pro-Israel, very pro, more than anybody on this stage,' " Trump said, adding that he can’t negotiate as well if he takes sides. "With that being said, I am totally pro-Israel." Trump’s additional comments about Israel In December, Trump told the Associated Press that he doubted the commitment of Israelis and Palestinians to the peace process. But he suggested the big lift may have to come from Israel. "A lot will have to do with Israel and whether or not Israel wants to make the deal, whether or not Israel's willing to sacrifice certain things," Trump said. "They may not be, and I understand that, and I'm okay with that. But then you're just not going to have a deal." Trump evaded specific questions about whether Palestinian demands are legitimate but said that Israeli housing projects were a "huge sticking point" in talks. The same week, when he spoke to the Republican Jewish Coalition, Trump praised Israel by saying that the country has already "given a lot" but doesn’t get credit for it. He explained his strategy if elected: "I don’t like to as a deal maker give away a lot of cards by talking about how I feel about this or that. I’d rather save it for that moment when you walk into the room," he said. "I don’t want one side or the other saying ... I think people know where I stand, okay?" He said he would want to enter negotiations with a "clean slate" and the attitude of "everybody is even, we love everybody, let’s see if we can do something." Trump also reminded Jewish Republicans that he endorsed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 2013. "I am a big fan of Israel," Trump said in the video endorsement. "And frankly a strong prime minister is a strong Israel." During his own campaign, Trump had planned on meeting with Netanyahu in Israel but canceled the trip after Netanyahu faced backlash after Trump’s comments about Muslims. When asked at the Republican Jewish Coalition if he had relationships with any Arab leaders, Trump said, "I haven’t been working too much with the Arab leaders." Trump’s rhetoric is notable on Israel because it is "cooler and more detached" than his GOP rivals, wrote Aaron David Miller, a former adviser to Republican and Democratic secretaries of state on Arab-Israeli negotiations who now works for the Woodrow Wilson Center. But while Trump has said he can be a better negotiator if he appears neutral, he has made several comments that suggest he has closer ties to Israelis than Palestinians. Trump’s spokespersons did not respond for this fact-check. Our ruling A PAC that supports Rubio says Trump "says he would be neutral between Israel and its enemies." Trump has said that in order to negotiate between Israelis and Palestinians he can’t take sides. "Let me be sort of a neutral guy," he said at a town hall. But the ad omits that Trump has had ties to Israel for years -- he has called himself "pro-Israel" and endorsed Netanyahu’s re-election in 2013. That is a good indication Trump isn’t neutral.

pomt-06139	Says Joe Biden said Jon Corzine is "the smartest guy that I know, in terms of the economy and on finance, I really mean this."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/dec/22/national-republican-congressional-committee/congressional-republican-group-claims-joe-biden-sa/	President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden campaigned for their fellow Democrat Jon Corzine as he fought in 2009 for re-election as New Jersey’s governor. They may now be regretting that choice. Corzine, the chairman and CEO of MF Global when it collapsed this fall, has been compelled to testify in front of several Congressional panels about the up to $1.2 billion in client money that disappeared during the firm’s bankruptcy. Using audio from Corzine’s testimony earlier this month and other video clips, the National Republican Congressional Committee released a web ad that ties Corzine, a former senator and governor of New Jersey, to the Obama administration. In the ad posted to YouTube on Dec. 15, Biden says of Corzine, "he's the smartest guy that I know in terms of the economy and on finance, I really mean this." As Biden makes the comment, a headline in the corner of the video reads: "MF Global Proves Enron-Era Accounting Lives On," linking MF Global to the Texas-based energy company that went bankrupt and became a symbol of corporate fraud. PolitiFact New Jersey found that Biden made the comment during a May 2009 appearance with Corzine in Lodi to tout a project funded by the federal stimulus act, formally known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The ad shows only a short segment of Biden’s speech, but we found two videos on YouTube with Biden’s longer comments -- one of which was posted by an account for Corzine. "Look, the governor just laid out for you the overlap that exists in terms of the things your state is doing and leading on, on energy conservation, on wind and solar, what your state is doing on building schools and investing in education, what your state is doing on health care. And it's not coincidental that that's what the Recovery Act is," Biden said. "It's not coincidental that the things he did here turned out to be the exact same things the Recovery Act has, because way back in the transition period, before we were sworn in, when Barack Obama and I were literally sitting in a desk in a high rise in Chicago beginning to plan how we would try to get this economy out of a ditch. Literally, the first guy I called was Jon Corzine. Not a joke. Not a joke. Because first of all, he's the smartest guy that I know in terms of the economy and on finance, I really mean this." So Biden praised Corzine’s financial prowess then, but is it fair to tie those past comments to what’s happening now? Michele Claibourn, a research associate at the University of Virginia’s Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service, and Tobe Berkovitz, an associate professor of advertising at Boston University who also works as a political media consultant for campaigns, said yes. Claibourn said in an email that "prior praise of Corzine strikes me as relevant insofar as Biden’s/Obama’s praise calls into question the judgment of the administration." Berkovitz said Corzine "had a reputation in terms of being fiscally brilliant and all that and so to say well things have changed now, this is a man who received the accolades of the president, of the vice president and they now should be held accountable for the opinions of the man." "You can’t say, ‘well I’d like to take that back,’" he said. Our ruling The National Republican Congressional Committee released an ad that links Corzine to the Obama administration. In it, Biden says, "he’s the smartest guy that I know, in terms of the economy and on finance, I really mean this." Biden made the comment about Corzine before MF Global collapsed and customer funds disappeared, but they’re still the vice president’s words. We rate the statement True.

pomt-04476	"When (Joe Kyrillos) had an opportunity to vote for women in terms of their health care, not once, not twice, but six times, he voted against women’s health care in our state."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/oct/08/robert-menendez/us-sen-robert-menendez-claims-state-sen-joe-kyrill/	Funding for women’s health care in New Jersey has become a line of attack in the race between U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., and his Republican challenger, state Sen. Joe Kyrillos, R-Monmouth. In their first debate Thursday before the general election on Nov. 6, Menendez claimed that Kyrillos has voted six times to oppose women’s health care funding. "When he had an opportunity to vote for women in terms of their health care, not once, not twice, but six times, he voted against women’s health care in our state," the Democratic senator said near the start of the debate. He repeated the claim in his closing statement: "And not once, not twice, but six times he voted against funding for women’s health care in our state, while I was bringing millions of dollars for those women to get health care." The senator’s claim is on solid ground. Between June 2010 and June 2012, Kyrillos voted six times against providing about $7.5 million for family planning services, which could include breast exams, pregnancy testing and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases. The money could not be used for abortion procedures. Chapin Fay, Kyrillos’ campaign manager, responded in a statement: "New Jerseyans know that Joe Kyrillos is a pro-choice Republican who's voted for millions of dollars in women's health initiatives, and that's a fact." Let’s go through those six votes. Since Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, eliminated the money in his budget for fiscal year 2011, the Democrat-led state Legislature has tried unsuccessfully to restore it. As we found in a previous fact-check, that funding reduction led to the closure of six family planning centers across the state. The first set of Kyrillos’ votes occurred on June 28, 2010, when the state Senate considered a bill that would restore the roughly $7.5 million. The Senate cast two sets of votes to pass the bill, and Kyrillos voted no each time. The state Assembly later passed the bill, but Christie vetoed it. On Sept. 20, 2010, the Senate failed to get enough votes to override the veto. Kyrillos voted against the override. On May 23, 2011, the Senate put forward another bill that would restore the funding for fiscal year 2011, and Kyrillos voted no. That bill passed the Senate, but was not voted on in the Assembly. Soon afterward, the legislature included the $7.5 million in the fiscal year 2012 budget sent to the governor, but Christie eliminated that funding as part of his line-item vetoes. On July 11, 2011, when the Senate fell short of having enough votes to override that veto, Kyrillos voted against the override. The most recent vote occurred on June 25, 2012, when the Senate passed a bill that would restore the funding for fiscal year 2012. Kyrillos voted no. The Assembly also passed the bill that day, but Christie later vetoed it. Here’s a chart breaking down Kyrillos’ votes against funding for family planning services: Date Legislation Proposed Action Kyrillos Vote June 28, 2010* Senate Bill S-2139 Final passage No June 28, 2010 Senate Bill S-2139 Final passage No Sept. 20, 2010 Senate Bill S-2139 Override veto No May 23, 2011 Senate Bill S-2899 Final passage No July 11, 2011 FY2012 Budget Override veto No June 25, 2012 Senate Bill S-788 Final passage No *Due to an error in the original bill, the Senate voted twice on final passage of the legislation. Our ruling In a debate last week, Menendez said in reference to Kyrillos: "When he had an opportunity to vote for women in terms of their health care, not once, not twice, but six times, he voted against women’s health care in our state." The senator’s claim is on target. Between June 2010 and June 2012, Kyrillos voted six times against providing about $7.5 million for family planning services. We rate the statement True.

pomt-01117	Only 42 percent of young Georgians have a college certificate or degree, but soon 60 percent of jobs will require some college credential.	true	/georgia/statements/2015/jan/07/hank-huckaby/huckaby-target-stats-skills-gap/	State officials are trying to prepare for a time in the near future when it is anticipated that a majority of Georgia jobs will require employees with some college credentials. They’re pushing the state’s technical colleges, colleges and universities to increase the number of degrees and certificates they issue, based largely on two statistics: by 2020, 60 percent of all Georgia jobs will require workers with some college credential; and only 42 percent of young Georgians currently have a college certificate or degree. Hank Huckaby, chancellor of the University System of Georgia, cited those statistics in a December 16th speech to the Valdosta North Rotary Club. Some PolitiFact Georgia readers saw the resulting news accounts and asked us to delve deeper into the statistics. This is a hot topic given that, a decade ago, the United States was the world’s leader in producing college students with bachelor’s degrees — an indicator, analysts say, of long-term economic strength. Today, the U.S. ranks 12th — in the key age range of 25 to 34 — behind nations such as Russia and South Korea. Georgia has based its response to the looming workforce crisis on two major reports. The first was "Help Wanted," a report published in 2010 by Georgetown University’s Center on Education and the Workforce. The report forecast that more than 60 percent of jobs nationally, 58 percent in Georgia, will require some form of postsecondary education by 2018. The second report, "Time is the Enemy," from Complete College America, from September 2011http://www.completecollege.org/docs/Time_Is_the_Enemy.pdf, also assessed America’s workforce readiness. It found Georgia with a 27 percent skills gap based on forecasts that 61 percent of the state’s jobs in 2020 would require a career certificate or college degree and, at the time, only 34 percent of Georgia adults had an associate degree or higher. North Carolina and Florida were similar to Georgia. North Carolina was listed in the report with a 27 percent skills gap, Florida with a 28 percent skills gap. So where did the 42 percent statistic for Georgia come from? The University System of Georgia and the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems worked together in Summer 2011 to try to assess how many credentialed adults were in Georgia. They found that 42.4 percent of Georgians, ages 25 to 34 at the time, had college experience -- 20.9 percent had bachelor’s degrees; 8.2 percent had a graduate or professional degree; 6.7 percent had an associate degree; and 6.6 percent had certificates from college programs that were at least one year, but less than two years. The data is from two "credible authorities," the U.S. Census Bureau and the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System. It is considered "the most reliable available," said Charlie Sutlive, the university system’s spokesman. An update is tentatively set for 2017, which will mark five years since the rollout of the Complete College Georgia initiative at college and university campuses across the state, Sutlive said. In August 2011, Gov. Nathan Deal announced that Georgia was one of 10 states that had been awarded a $1 million grant by the nonprofit Complete College America to significantly increase its college completion rates. The statistics at the time were bleak, given the forecasts for Georgia jobs in the not-too-distant future. Less than 25 percent of full-time students at Georgia’s two-year colleges ever graduate, and only 44 percent of students at the state’s four-year colleges receive their degrees in six years, the governor said. That combination -- unchanged -- would only spell trouble, Deal said. He and others have devised plans to ensure that the state’s colleges, universities and technical are churning out more degrees or certificates. The university system produced about 53,000 degrees a year in 2012, is on target to produce 69,000 degrees a year in 2020 and has a goal of 80,000 a year by 2025, Suitive said. The technical college system has plans for similar year-over-year increases. The University System of Georgia and Technical College System of Georgia have taken several major steps to increase their graduates. For instance, they’ve simplified the enrollment process and now allow credit for 25 courses to transfer between the two systems. Online course offerings also expanded from 1,571 in 2009 to 5,000-plus last fall -- including a new Master’s of Science in Computer Science at Georgia Tech enrolling 1,256 new students. Our conclusion: Georgia’s workforce is facing a skills gap that the University System of Georgia and Technical College System of Georgia are working together to address by pushing for more graduates. The skills gap is significant, though measures of it have varied albeit slightly. We rate Huckaby's statement as True.	None	Hank Huckaby	None	None	None	2015-01-07T00:00:00	2014-12-16	['None']
pomt-08810	"The unemployment rate for folks who've never gone to college is almost double what it is for those who have."	true	/texas/statements/2010/aug/17/barack-obama/president-barack-obama-says-unemployment-rate-thos/	Yes, the unemployment rate is still high. But those without a college degree are hurting even more, according to President Barack Obama, who was in Austin last week to raise money for fellow Democrats. "Now, I know some folks argue that as we emerge from the worst recession since the Great Depression, my administration should focus solely on economic issues," he said during a side speech at the University of Texas at Austin on Aug. 9. "But as I said the other week to the National Urban League, education is an economic issue. It may be the economic issue of our time. It’s an economic issue when the unemployment rate for folks who’ve never gone to college is almost double what it is for those who have." Almost double? Matt Lehrich, a White House spokesman, pointed us to employment data kept by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Looking at labor force statistics from the Current Population Survey, the unemployment rate for those with at least a bachelor's degree was 4.5 percent in July 2010, while 10.1 percent of high school graduates who didn't attend college were without jobs. Add those who never graduated from high school, and the unemployment rate creeps up to 11 percent. That's more than double the unemployment rate for Americans with a bachelor's, master's, doctorate or professional degree. Include those who attend attended "some college" or earned an associates degree, and the jobless rate for the college crowd is 6 percent. So, as of July, the unemployment rate for those who never went to college is almost double what it is for those who have. How did the two unemployment rates shake out historically? The data during the last two years show similar ratios. In 2009, on average, about 10.9 percent of those who never attended college were unemployed, while 6.1 percent of those with at least some college were unemployed. In 2008, the unemployment rate was 6.4 percent for those without college, and about 3.1 for those who had. We rate Obama's statement as True.

pomt-09940	"If you actually took the number of Muslims [sic] Americans, we'd be one of the largest Muslim countries in the world."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jun/04/barack-obama/obama-claims-america-one-largest-muslim-countries/	In the days leading up to his trip to Cairo to give a long-awaited speech before a large Muslim audience, President Barack Obama gave several radio and television interviews, including one in which he claimed that the United States has so many Muslim residents that it would qualify as one of the largest populations in the world. "If you actually took the number of Muslims Americans (sic), we'd be one of the largest Muslim countries in the world," he told French television station Canal Plus. Obama's comment was meant to emphasize the religious diversity of the United States and the importance of understanding between the Western world and followers of Islam, a key point in the speech he gave in Cairo on June 4, 2009. "What I want to do is to create a better dialogue so that the Muslim world understands more effectively how the United States but also how the West thinks about many of these difficult issues like terrorism, like democracy," he told Canal Plus. "Now, the flip side is I think that the United States and the West generally, we have to educate ourselves more effectively on Islam." Some PolitiFact readers heard Obama's claim and asked us to check it. We should note that estimates of the number of Muslims living in America varies greatly. For example, the Islamic Information Center, a group that educates people in the United States about Islam, says there are upwards of 8 million. And NationMaster.com, a Web site that allows users to compare different countries based on demographics, pegs the number at 6 million. We are using numbers from the CIA Online World Factbook, a highly regarded government source for global statistics. It's updated twice a month, and we're relying on the latest version. By the World Factbook's count, Muslims in the United States make up about 0.6 percent of the population. That's around 1.8 million. Using the CIA's data, we made a list of the 60 countries with the most Muslim residents. Coming in first is Indonesia, More than 240 million people live there, and 86.1 percent of the population identifies as Muslim. That means that about 206 million Indonesians are of the Islamic faith. No. 2 on the list is Pakistan, where 95 percent of the roughly 176 million people identify as Muslim. That means about 167 million residents are of the Islamic faith. India, Bangladesh and Turkey come in next at 156 million, 129 million and 76 million, respectively. Moving down the list, Morocco takes 10th place with 34 million Muslim residents, and Syria comes in at number 20, with about 18 million Muslims. The No. 60 slot goes to Serbia, home to 236,138 Muslims. According to our calculations, you have to scroll down to the very bottom to see where the United States fits in amid all these statistics. Again, the CIA Factbook says that less than 1 percent — 0.6 percent to be precise — of the 307 million residents identify as Muslim. That means the United States has only 1.8 million Muslims. So, of the 60 most populous Muslim states, the United States ranks 58th. If we rely instead on NationMaster.com, which pegs the Muslim population at 6 million, the United States is 37th out of 60. And if we go with 8 million, as the Islamic Information Center estimates, the United States comes in at 29 on the list. The exact number of how many Muslims are living in the United States is fuzzy at best. But one thing is for certain: No matter who you slice it, America ranks low, whether it's 1.8 million or 8 million. So Obama is trying to make a point that the United States is in touch with the Muslim world because it has a substantial Muslim population. But he dramatically overreaches by saying the United States would be one of the largest Muslim countries in the world. Ranking 58 out of the world's 60 most populous Muslim nations does not a large Muslim country make. Indeed, by even the most generous estimate we found of 8 million, the United States still ranks 29 out of 60. As a result, we give Obama a Pants on Fire.

pomt-07143	Says George LeMieux "even compared Marco Rubio to Barack Obama."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2011/jun/15/adam-hasner/hasner-says-lemieux-compared-rubio-obama/	Republican U.S. Senate candidate Adam Hasner is attacking GOP opponent George LeMieux by invoking two names likely to displease conservative primary voters. Barack Obama and Charlie Crist. In an Internet ad released June 10, 2011, Hasner tries to link LeMieux to Crist -- the former governor who left the GOP while trying to win a Senate seat in 2010. Marco Rubio, a former House speaker who served as a state legislator from 2000 to 2008 and is now a national Republican star, won that seat. The ad shows a photo of Crist and then states: Defended President Obama's Stimulus As "Helpful to Florida" Fought For Taxpayer Funded Bailout Of Big Sugar Architect Of Obama-Style Cap And Trade Plan For Florida Falsely Attacked Marco Rubio Even Compared Marco Rubio To Barack Obama Charlie Crist -- Right? Wrong. As the word "wrong" appears, the camera zooms out on the picture of Crist. There is LeMieux, whispering in Crist's ear. The ad finishes -- "Get to know the Real George LeMieux." The goal of the message is clear enough: Paint a portrait of LeMieux -- Crist's former chief of staff who was later appointed by Crist to serve in the U.S. Senate -- as an Obama-loving Crist buddy who criticized Florida's GOP superstar, Rubio. But is it accurate? For this Truth-O-Meter item we will examine the claim Hasner made that LeMieux "even compared Marco Rubio to Barack Obama." In a related Truth-O-Meter item, we're checking another claim that LeMieux "falsely attacked Marco Rubio." Hasner's ad cited a Nov. 17, 2009, St. Petersburg Times article as the source for LeMieux comparing Rubio to Obama. Back then, LeMieux was supporting Crist over Rubio. And back then, Crist was still running as a Republican. LeMieux critiqued Rubio in an item posted to the Times' online blog, The Buzz. From The Buzz: "Being governor means you have to make choices. And you have to make decisions," LeMieux said, heading into a GOP lunch at the U.S. Capitol. "It's very easy to be a critic and the speaker now is not in office. He wasn't there when the state was facing the challenges of the huge recession and the stimulus. He didn't have to vote on that. All of the folks that were in his administration voted for the stimulus money. And I suspect if he were there, he could vote for it. This is just like President Obama being able to be against the war in Iraq because he didn't have to vote on it. There's a lot of parallels to draw between Speaker Rubio and President Obama in the way they are running their race and in their ability to throw bombs without ever having to lead because they are out of office." LeMieux was arguing that it was easy for Rubio, who left the Legislature in 2008, to criticize Crist for taking stimulus money when Rubio was no longer in the Legislature -- just like it was easy for Obama to oppose going to war against Iraq because he wasn't in the U.S. Senate or White House then. (Obama was in the Illinois Legislature when Operation Iraqi Freedom was launched in 2003.) LeMieux isn't comparing Rubio and Obama on a stance or an issue here (like they both supported cap-and-trade, or something like that). He is making a general point that it's easy for candidates to later oppose something they didn't have to vote on. None of that is made clear in the ad. But that's not the only problem when considering this claim. "George endorsed Marco the day after Charlie left the Republican Party and aggressively campaigned for Marco in the General Election," LeMieux campaign manager Brian Seitchik e-mailed us June 13. LeMieux hosted a fundraiser for Rubio, campaigned with him and introduced him at events, Seitchik wrote. (Note: Crist left the GOP on April 29. The next day LeMieux issued this statement: "I am saddened that my friend, Governor Crist, has decided to leave the Republican Party. Our friendship runs deep, but my commitment to the principles of the Republican Party runs deeper. I cannot walk down the path he has chosen. ... I will support our Republican nominee and will continue to do everything I can both in Florida and across the country to increase the number of Republicans in the United States Senate." A formal endorsement of Rubio didn't come until July, however, according to The Hill which cited the conservative blog, The Shark Tank.) There are other examples of LeMieux supporting Rubio. On July 12, 2010, The Buzz reported that LeMieux's PAC gave $2,400 to Rubio's campaign. The conservative blog the Shark Tank reported on the same day that LeMieux endorsed Rubio -- see a video of LeMieux here calling Rubio a "good conservative candidate." And LeMieux campaigned for Rubio at a few Central Florida stops -- including The Villages retirement community -- the Palm Beach Post reported Oct 7. At one of events, LeMieux called Rubio '"the brightest star of our generation in politics — and not just in Florida, nationwide,'" the Post wrote. Lastly, we have to point out that simply comparing Rubio, a Republican, to Obama, a Democrat, doesn't have to be a bad thing. The New Republic, for instance, called Rubio the "Republican Obama" in a February 2010 article. And a national conservative figure, Richard Land, was quoted in 2010 talking up a Rubio run for president in 2012, noting that Rubio would have "more experience than Obama had" when Obama ran for president. (PolitiFact Florida rated that claim Barely True.) On the whole, this claim is puzzling. Let's again look at the text of the ad, which starts by linking LeMieux to three issues -- the federal stimulus package, Big Sugar and cap and trade. Then the ad abruptly switches to general statements about Rubio saying that LeMieux falsely attacked Rubio and "compared Rubio to Barack Obama." LeMieux didn't compare Rubio and Obama on an issue such as those listed at the start of the ad -- he said they both used a familiar campaign tactic, throwing "bombs" about something they didn't have to vote on themselves. The ad provides no explanation for how he compared the two politicians and neglects to note that LeMieux supported Rubio's campaign once Crist left the GOP. We rate this statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-07473	"Medicare passed with virtually no Republican support."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/15/peter-defazio/peter-defazio-says-medicare-passed-virtually-no-re/	During a House floor speech on April 13, 2011, Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., took aim at a recent proposal by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., to change the way the Medicare system works. As part of a plan for reducing the national debt, Ryan proposes that Americans 55 and younger today would not get traditional Medicare but rather qualify for a government "premium support" to help them buy health insurance from a private company starting in 2022. (We recently fact-checked a characterization of the plan by one of Ryan’s fellow Republicans, Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana; see it here.) DeFazio, in his floor speech, decried Ryan’s plan, arguing that it would all but gut a popular program that works well. "Before Medicare, 25 percent of the seniors in America lived in poverty, many driven there by the lack of affordable, decent health insurance," DeFazio said. "Medicare passed with virtually no Republican support. It solved that problem. Seniors today are guaranteed quality, affordable health care. They pay about 27 percent of the cost. While under the guise of fiscal responsibility, the Republican budget wants to turn back the clock to the good old days: Throw the seniors into the private health care market again." We wondered whether DeFazio was right that "Medicare passed with virtually no Republican support." In 2009, we rated a similar statement by former Democratic National Committee chairman Howard Dean, and we will draw from it as we analyze DeFazio’s more recent statement. It turns out that a significant number of Republicans did vote in favor of the Medicare bill when Congress took it up in 1965. The House adopted a conference report -- a unified House-Senate version of the bill -- on July 27, 1965, and passed it by a 307-116 margin. That included 70 Republican "yes" votes, against 68 "no" votes. Then, on July 28, 1965, the Senate adopted the bill by a vote of 70-24, with 13 Republicans in favor and 17 against. President Lyndon B. Johnson signed it two days later. So in the House, a slight majority of the Republican caucus voted for Medicare, and in the Senate, a significant minority voted in favor. Both of these strike us as more than "virtually no Republican support." It’s true that the Medicare bill was unpopular in certain segments of the Republican Party. In 1961, Ronald Reagan, the future president, famously released an LP with a speech in which he demonized "socialized medicine," citing proposals that sound a lot like the one passed four years later. "Write those letters now; call your friends and then tell them to write them," Reagan said. "If you don't, this program, I promise you, will pass just as surely as the sun will come up tomorrow, and behind it will come other federal programs that will invade every area of freedom as we have known it in this country. ... And if you don't do this and if I don't do it, one of these days we are going to spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children, what it once was like in America when men were free." Other high-profile Republicans who opposed Medicare included Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater -- the unsuccessful Republican presidential nominee in 1964 -- and future president George H.W. Bush. And as the Medicare bill progressed through the House, Republican support was scant. No Republicans voted for the bill until it reached the floor. It passed the Ways and Means Committee by a party-line vote of 17-8. And all four Republicans on the House Rules Committee — the panel that sets the boundaries of debate on all bills that come to the House floor — voted against the bill. As the bill worked its way through the Senate, Republican support was somewhat stronger. In the final Finance Committee vote, the measure passed 12-5, with four of the committee's eight Republicans supporting it. "The political parties were very different in 1965 than they are today," said Donald Ritchie, the historian of the U.S. Senate. "Both had strong conservative and liberal wings, so most votes were bipartisan because the conservatives in the two parties voted against the liberals in each party. You had Republicans like Jacob Javits (N.Y.) who were more liberal than most Democrats, and Democrats like James Eastland (Miss.) who were more conservative than most Republicans. So there were Republicans who supported Medicare and Democrats who opposed it." When we contacted DeFazio’s office, a spokeswoman noted that the congressman has a background in gerontology and offered links to articles, including this one, to show that Republicans "fought against the creation of Medicare starting with the Truman administration." It’s true that some of the biggest opponents of Medicare early on were Republicans. But many big opponents were conservative Democrats, and ultimately, it’s wrong to say, as DeFazio does, that "Medicare passed with virtually no Republican support." His comment focuses on the period when the bill finally passed, and thanks to the GOP’s liberal-to-moderate wing -- which by now has largely disappeared -- a majority of House Republicans and a sizable minority of Senate Republicans voted in favor of Medicare. We rate DeFazio’s statement False.	None	Peter DeFazio	None	None	None	2011-04-15T11:31:13	2011-04-13	['Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-09519	Among the money spent on health care in the United States, "46 cents on every dollar spent is through Medicare and Medicaid."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/16/joe-biden/biden-overstates-role-medicare-medicaid-us-health-/	In an appearance on NBC's Meet the Press on Feb. 14, 2010, Vice President Joe Biden made the case for restraining costs through the administration's approach to health care reform and discussed the scope of federal spending on health care. "I think the president made the right judgment in deciding that in order to bend the cost curve and prevent people from being victimized by health insurance costs that we had to move and we had to move aggressively," Biden said. "And the president is still committed to making sure that we do three things: One, make sure that those whose premiums are now continuing to skyrocket in fact are brought under control; making sure that the money the federal government spends on health care, 46 cents on every dollar spent is through Medicare and Medicaid, that we bend that cost curve to gain control of the future, of our future fiscal situation; and making sure the insurance companies can't engage in the kind of practices they do with pre-existing conditions and limits on coverage, etc." The 46-cents-on-the-dollar figure sounded high to us, so we decided to check. We looked at the Congressional Budget Office's June 2009, report, "The Long-Term Budget Outlook." The report says that in 2007, 54 percent of the $2.1 trillion spent on health care in the United States was financed privately. That leaves 46 percent (or, as Biden put it, 46 cents on the dollar) financed by public sources. So Biden used the right statistic -- but he was less than careful in his description of what the statistic described. According to the CBO report, federal spending on Medicare made up 21 percent of total U.S. health care expenditures in 2007, and the combined federal and state spending on Medicaid represented 16 percent. Given that the federal government on average pays 57 percent of the cost for Medicaid (the federal share varies state by state), the federal portion of spending on Medicaid actually represents 9 percent of U.S. health care expenditures. So when Biden specifically said that "the money the federal government spends on health care, 46 cents on every dollar spent is through Medicare and Medicaid," he overstated the federal percentage for the two programs. It's actually 30 cents of every dollar, rather than 46 cents. So what accounts for the 16 percentage-point difference? The answer is federal money spent on health care programs other than Medicare and Medicaid (including veterans' health care, military health care and the State Children's Health Insurance Program) and funds spent on health care by state and local governments. "What he really should have said was that 46 percent comes from public spending, rather than saying 46 percent comes from Medicare and Medicaid," said Marc Goldwein, policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. A spokesman for Biden conceded that the vice president should have been clearer. "The vice president's list of federal programs should have been longer than Medicare and Medicaid -- he cited only these two largest programs in the interest of time," said Jay Carney, Biden's communications director. "He should have said 'such as' or 'including.' " As a sidelight, Brookings Institution health care scholar Henry Aaron points out that even the 54 percent of health care dollars that are privately financed are indirectly supported by the federal government, through such policies as tax exclusions for employer-provided health care. The value of these supports is estimated to run into the billions of dollars. But that isn't what Biden was talking about. Essentially, the vice president cited an accurate number, but he failed to describe correctly what it meant, and he ended up making the share of federal Medicare and Medicaid spending seem half again as big as it actually is. We rate his statement Half True.	None	Joe Biden	None	None	None	2010-02-16T13:38:01	2010-02-14	['United_States', 'Medicare_(United_States)']
pomt-10540	"We have seen hate crimes skyrocket in the wake of the immigration debate."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/22/barack-obama/up-yes-but-maybe-not-skyrocketing/	In the Democratic debate in Austin, Texas on Feb. 22, 2008, Sen. Barack Obama, pleaded for more civility in the immigration debate, because it is encouraging hate crimes against Hispanics. "Number one, it is absolutely critical that we tone down the rhetoric when it comes to the immigration debate, because there has been an undertone that has been ugly," Obama said. "Oftentimes it has been directed at the Hispanic community. We have seen hate crimes skyrocket in the wake of the immigration debate, as it's been conducted in Washington, and that is unacceptable." Indeed, the South Poverty Law Center, which monitors hate groups, reached that same conclusion in an Intelligence Report in late 2007. The report, titled "Immigration Backlash" cited FBI statistics that showed a 35 percent increase in hate crimes against Hispanics between 2003 and 2006. Hateful and false propaganda, once limited to white supremacy groups and border state extremists, has made its way into the mouths of political pundits, radio talk show hosts and even some politicians, said Mark Potok, director of the Intelligence Report for the Southern Poverty Law Center. According to the report: "While their dehumanizing rhetoric typically stops short of openly sanctioning bloodshed, much of it implicitly encourages or even endorses violence by characterizing immigrants from Mexico and Central America as 'invaders,' 'criminal aliens' and 'cockroaches.'" The findings and conclusions of that study are echoed by a report from the National Council of La Raza, the largest national Latino civil rights and advocacy organization in the U.S. That report also cited FBI statistics for hate crimes against Hispanics between 2003 and 2006. According to the FBI numbers, the number of anti-Hispanic hate crimes rose from 426 in 2003 to 576 in 2006, the year the immigration issues came to the forefront of the national debate. But are the numbers reliable and significant enough to suggest a trend? Potok allows that the statistics have limitations. For one, the numbers are relatively small. Potok notes, however, that National Crime Victimization surveys suggest the hate crimes in the annual crime report are about 20 to 30 times lower than the actual number of hate crimes actually committed, but which go largely unreported. He also argues that while the numbers are small, the large percentage change between the years represents a significant trend. It should be noted, however, that if one tracks the FBI's hate crime statistics prior to 2003, the trend of rising violence due to heated rhetoric becomes less clear. For example, the FBI reports 597 anti-Hispanic hate crimes in 2001 and 557 in 2000 - about the same as the 2006 numbers. Regardless of the numbers, many Hispanic organization leaders like Angela Kelley, director of the Immigration Policy Center in Washington, say Obama is dead-on based on what they are hearing from members. In a 2006 national survey of Latinos conducted by the Pew Hispanic Center, more than half (54%) said they believe the debate has increased discrimination. "Within the community, there is an overwhelming feeling that this is an unmistakable trend," said Cecilia Munoz, senior vice president of policy for the National Council of La Raza. Before the immigration issue blew up in 2006, her organization would occasionally get hate mail. Now, she said, they get hate mail every day, some of them with threats. At their annual conference, they now provide security training to members of Hispanic advocacy groups. "For the first time, our affiliates are getting hate mail and threats," she said. "There's just no doubt that what Sen. Obama said reflects what people are feeling in the community." Obama's campaign did not respond to Politifact's request to explain where he got his numbers. As noted, when you look at the historical trend over the last 10 years, the numbers roller-coaster, so it's hard to say, based on those numbers, whether anti-Hispanic hate crimes have actually spiked due to the immigration debate. It's also true that the relatively small number of reported incidents makes even a few additional ones look like a dramatic increase, in terms of percentage. But the numbers steadily rose from 2003 to 2006 and Obama's comment fairly and accurately reflects two reports that reached that conclusion. So we rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-07660	On the night of the Wisconsin state Senate vote on the budget package, "a mob showed up and busted down the door and took over the Capitol."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/mar/11/scott-fitzgerald/wisconsin-senate-majority-leader-scott-fitzgerald-/	After weeks of protests and political maneuvering, the stalemate on Wisconsin’s controversial budget-repair bill ended in lightning fashion the evening of March 9, 2011, after a surprise move by Republicans. The Senate, which had been blocked from acting because of the absence of 14 Democrats who fled to Illinois, approved the bill -- which curtails collective bargaining rights for most public employees and requires them to pay more for health care and pensions -- in a matter of minutes. In those same minutes, the Capitol went from relative calm to chaos. The following morning, state Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, described the scene in an interview with talk show host Charlie Sykes on WTMJ-AM (620). He told of Capitol staffers seeing a crowd moving down State Street from the direction of the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus to the Capitol and shouts and anger from opponents who already were inside. Other reports told of how in the two hours leading up the vote -- the amount of time for which notice of a Senate-Assembly conference committee meeting had been given -- Twitter and Facebook alerts went out urging union members and other bill opponents to high-tail it to the Capitol. The daily protests that had wound down a week earlier resumed with a new fury, more urgent and angry. Indeed, soon after the vote Republican senators received an e-mailed death threat that is under investigation. Fitzgerald described the scene after the vote this way in his conversation with Sykes: "Suddenly, a mob showed up and busted down the door and took over the Capitol." Let’s stop for a minute. To be sure, the scene was chaotic. And there are many reports, some of them contradictory, on specific things that happened. In the wake of the vote and the reaction by protesters, the rhetoric on both sides was heated and, often, over the top. In this item, we will look at Fitzgerald’s statement, which was one of the clearest assertions on what happened. First, a little more background: The move to vote on the bill surprised many, since there had been indications during the week of talks between Democratic and Republican lawmakers and Gov. Scott Walker. The conference committee -- which included members of both parties and from both chambers -- met on two hours’ notice, to pave the way for final passage. Democrats argue the meeting violated the state open meetings law, which generally requires 24-hour notice of meetings, or two hours under emergency circumstances. Republicans say the meeting did not violate the law, since the Legislature is in special session and in those cases no advance notice is required. The courts may ultimately decide who is right. At the meeting, the committee cleared the way for quick action by dropping some parts of the bill -- the pieces that required a minimum of 20 members to be present. But the committee left intact the key pieces: Walker’s push to have public employees pay more for health care and pensions and to curtail collective bargaining rights for most public employees. The committee met for mere minutes, with Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca, D-Kenosha, complaining loudly he did not even have time to read the new language. The vote took place just after 6 p.m. -- after the building would normally be closed. But because the Senate was in session, the building was kept open. One entrance was open while the other two were locked, according to the Department of Administration. Some members of the public were present. They shouted their disapproval when the conference committee sent the matter to the Senate, which met literally minutes later -- without the still-absent Democrats -- and quickly voted to approve the bill. The bill was then sent to the Assembly, which was already scheduled to take it up the following morning. A crowd began to gather during and after the unexpected action by the Senate, fueled no doubt by media reports and the urgent Twitter and Facebook messages. Protesters arrived and some tried to muscle their way into the building. After the vote, police tried to close the building but faced a growing crowd. WTMJ-TV (Channel 4) showed law officers trying to keep a door closed, before being overwhelmed by protesters who streamed past them. Other footage showed people climbing into the Capitol through open windows. The police backed off. Soon the rotunda was, once again, filled with thousands of people. Hundreds stayed overnight. By morning, many had gathered outside the Assembly chamber. Some blocked access to office hallways and had to be physically removed by authorities. The building was declared to be on lockdown. The start of the Assembly session was delayed for hours due to problems providing clear, safe access to the building. (The bill ultimately passed on March 10, 2011, was signed into law the next day.) Now, let’s return to Fitzgerald’s statement, which has three clear assertions, the first of which was labeling the crowd a "mob." Here are a few dictionary definitions: Mob: A large disorderly crowd or throng. Mob: A disorderly or riotous crowd of people. Mob: A disorderly crowd of people. Was the crowd large? Yes? Disorderly? Yes, in that they refused to follow the orders of police officers and pushed past them. Were they riotous? There were no reported injuries or arrests. But that portion of Fitzgerald’s statement seems to fit the situation. Next, Fitzgerald said the crowd "busted down the door." They did not do so in the literal sense of knocking a door down. But they clearly overwhelmed police, who had tried to secure the doors and ultimately gave up. The Journal Sentinel had three reporters and two photographers at the Capitol that night. Their report said: "Protesters poured into the Capitol after police stopped guarding at least one entrance and outside doors were opened." Walk-throughs of the building early the next morning by reporters did not show signs of significant damage. The Department of Administration later provided its own damage summary: Wooden panels were kicked in on two exterior doors; seven windows had security hardware damaged or removed; hinge pins were removed on a pair of exterior doors and the bolting mechanism was broken on a service entrance. So, the crowd forced its way into the building and did some -- though not widespread -- damage. Finally, Fitzgerald’s statement said the crowd "took over the Capitol." Reports made it clear the protesters did not leave when they were asked to and there were enough problems that the building could not function as it normally would the following day. Staffers -- and lawmakers -- were initially unable to enter. The Assembly session was delayed for hours. Some media reports labeled the situation a "takeover," but that suggests more than occupying the building, which protesters did. It suggests controlling the building, which is not supported by the accounts we have heard. So where does this leave us? Fitzgerald’s declared a mob busted its way into the Capitol and took over the building. Yes, a large, angry crowd formed and some forced their way past police officers who fell back rather than try to prevent more from entering. The crowd did not literally bust down doors, but some damage was caused to the building. While they defied orders and delayed action the following day, they never controlled the situation. So, the thrust of Fitzgerald’s statement is correct, but the rhetoric overstates some of what actually happened. Indeed, some of the fallout was a result not just of the policy changes in the bill -- which have prompted weeks of protests -- but the procedure in how it was brought up for a vote. The short notice helped fuel the response and may have left authorities unprepared for it. The definition for Half True is "The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context." That’s our rating.

pomt-13870	"The steel industry is producing as much steel in the United States as it ever was. It’s just (that) it needs one-tenth of the workers that it used to."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/05/barack-obama/barack-obama-wrong-about-size-us-steel-production-/	When Donald Trump made a high-profile speech outlining his approach to trade, he did it in Monessen, Pa., a town near Pittsburgh where a big steel mill has been shuttered for the past three decades. A day after Trump’s speech, Barack Obama brought up the history of American steel during a joint appearance with the Canadian prime minister and the Mexican president, who were meeting for a summit in Ottawa. Reporters asked the three leaders what they would do to counter the anti-free-trade sentiment exemplified by Trump. Obama acknowledged the shortcomings of trade agreements, but he argued that reverting to tariffs and a possible trade war was the wrong way to improve the situation. He pointed to technological change as an irreversible factor. "This nostalgia about an era when everybody was working in manufacturing jobs, and you didn’t need a college degree, and you could go in and as long as you worked hard you could support a family and live a middle-class life -- that has been undermined far more by automation than it has been by outsourcing or the shift of jobs to ... low-wage countries," Obama said. "I mean, the steel industry is producing as much steel in the United States as it ever was. It’s just (that) it needs one-tenth of the workers that it used to." Several readers asked us to look into Obama’s comparison -- that "the steel industry is producing as much steel in the United States as it ever was. It’s just it needs one-tenth of the workers that it used to." It turns out that Obama was wrong on both counts. Steel production Frank Giarratani, an economist at the University of Pittsburgh who specializes in the steel industry, provided us with numbers calculated by the U.S. Geological Survey for raw steel production. The data goes back to 1900. The high point came in 1973, when the United States produced 137 million metric tons of raw steel. By 2013, the most recent year available, that had fallen to 87 million metric tons -- a decline of more than one-third from 1973. That’s not even close to "as much" as the peak, which is what Obama said. "We do produce a lot of steel, but current production is far below the post-WWII peak," Giarratani said. Raw steel production is also down a bit since 2008, when the figure was 92 million metric tons. That was the last year before Obama took office and, perhaps more important, the last year before the Great Recession really hit. Production plunged in 2009, before eventually rebounding. Other current economic trends have also had an impact. For instance, the ongoing decline in oil and gas drilling due to low prices is driving companies to cut back on tubing orders, contributing to a slowdown in steel production, said Jeff Manuel, an associate professor of historical studies at Southern Illinois University-Edwardsville. "I live near U.S. Steel’s Granite City Works in Granite City, Ill.," Manuel said. "This mill is currently shut down due, as I understand it, largely to slack demand from oil and gas companies in the Gulf Coast region." Steel industry employment Tracking employment is a little trickier than tracking production, but several experts said that the one-tenth figure Obama cited is off base. Data from the American Iron and Steel Institute pegged the all-time employment high at 650,000 employees in 1953. More recent data from the institute, for 2015, shows that the steel industry directly employs about 142,000 people in the United States. That’s closer to one in five jobs left, not the one in 10 Obama cited. "So one-tenth is an exaggeration," said Benjamin H. Liebman, an economist at Saint Joseph's University who specializes in international trade. The automation trend Obama mentioned did contribute to the downsizing. "The major reason that steel employment has fallen drastically over the last 40 years is improved technology," Liebman said. According to the American Iron and Steel Institute, "labor productivity has seen a fivefold increase since the early 1980s, going from an average of 10.1 man-hours per finished ton to an average of 1.9 man-hours per finished ton of steel in 2014." American steel production has increasingly shifted away from the extraction of ore for raw material and towards the recycling of scrap metal, which typically requires fewer workers. "Now, more than 50 percent of all steel produced in the United States is from a process that recycles scrap metal," Giarratani said. The White House acknowledged that Obama’s remark was incorrect, and instead told PolitiFact that "the U.S. is producing considerably more steel than when the president took office." However, the statistics the White House used to back up that assertion were based on 2009 data, which captured the post-recession low point. Our ruling Obama said that "the steel industry is producing as much steel in the United States as it ever was. It’s just it needs one-tenth of the workers that it used to." In reality, production is down by more than one-third from its historical peak in 1973, and the employment picture -- while still severely shrunken -- is down to about one-fifth of its 1950s level, rather than one-tenth.

pomt-10322	"Wild Bill Hickok had his first duel in the town square here. And the family legend is that he is a distant cousin of mine."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/30/barack-obama/just-call-him-wild-barack-obama/	In a packed town hall in Springfield, Mo., Sen. Barack Obama laid down the challenge for a duel. His eyes weren't exactly squinting. And theme music to The Good, the Bad and the Ugly could not be heard. But the gauntlet was dropped. "I'm ready to duel John McCain on taxes," Obama said. "Right here. Right now." Then Obama surprised the crowd. "I don't know if people are aware of the fact," Obama said, "but the family legend is that Wild Bill Hickok, he's a distant cousin of mine." The crowd roared with laughter. It seemed that perhaps the sun had gotten to him. "I'm serious, I'm serious," Obama said. "I don't know if it's true, but that's the family legend. But we're going to research that." No need, Sen. Obama. We called the New England Historic Genealogical Society. These are the folks who back in March released the study that found that Obama is a distant relative of actor Brad Pitt (ninth cousins, to be exact). Chris Child, a staff genealogist, compared geneological charts for Obama and Hickok and...bang...there it was. The two trees intersected with one Thomas Blossom of Holland, who arrived in Plymouth, Mass., in 1629. The two are sixth cousins six times removed, Child said. Whatever that means. Seems quite a length for Obama to go to support a metaphor about dueling with your opponent over taxes, but then Hickok was also a noted gambler. Obama also said that Hickok, the legendary frontier lawman, had his first duel in Springfield, Mo. While we were digging we looked that up, too. And Obama is right again. While it's hard for many historians to separate fact from legend, it is documented that James Butler Hickok (his name wasn't even William) got the better of former Confederate Army soldier Davis Tutt in a 1865 "quick draw" duel after a dispute involving gambling debts and, you guessed it, a woman. In the ensuing years, Hickok boasted of killing more than 100 men. Though in his defense, he said they all had it coming. Hickok got his in 1876 after he apparently broke the cardinal rule of gunfighters: He sat with his back to the door and was shot from behind while playing poker at a saloon in Deadwood, S.D. The story was that he was holding two pairs, aces and eights — hence the term "dead man's hand" still used today. The relation to "Wild Bill" Hickok is way cooler than the revelations earlier this year that Obama is distantly related to none other than vice president Dick Cheney. Undoubtedly, Obama took a lot of ribbing over that. Maybe those jokesters ought to sleep with one eye open because Obama's "family legend" is correct. We rule the statement True.

pomt-03842	Says president is ‘spending $2.2 billion to give away "ObamaPhones." ’	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/mar/15/steve-stockman/steve-stockman-says-president-spending-22-billion-/	Before the so-called sequestration budget cuts began taking effect March 1, 2013, U.S. Rep. Steve Stockman had some alternative suggestions for the president. On Feb. 22, he tweeted about one program he has suggested trimming: "Obama claims a small cut to federal means losing local police and firefighters, but he's spending $2.2 billion to give away ‘ObamaPhones.’ " As far back as 2009, PolitiFact has checked claims about President Barack Obama handing out free cell phones. We decided to see how this statement compared. The government initiative that helps low-income citizens pay for telephone service is the Federal Communications Commission’s Lifeline program. FCC spokesman Mark Wigfield told us by email that Lifeline began in 1985 because of concerns that local rates would rise after a government lawsuit broke up AT&T’s monopoly of the U.S. phone market. Lifeline was enshrined in law in the 1996 Telecommunications Act, Wigfield said, then in 2005 and 2008 began to allow "resellers" of cell service -- companies that did not own their own networks -- to participate. Today, he said, "about 75 percent of Lifeline support goes for wireless service." The program does not provide phones or phone service and is not paid for by taxes, Wigfield said. Rather, it pays $9.25 a month to a user’s phone company. Some companies give out free phones and price their plans at $9.25 a month, making the plans essentially "free," he said. Money for Lifeline comes out of the Universal Service Fund; phone companies pay into the fund and then pass the cost on to customers via a fee on their phone bills. (Click here to read more detailed explanations in this story’s excerpted emails.) Eligible Lifeline participants must have an income that is at or below 135 percent of the federal poverty level or use Medicaid, food stamps, federal public housing assistance or supplemental security income, among other things. In some cases, states administer their own programs. In early 2012, the FCC implemented changes to Lifeline aimed at modernizing the program and eliminating fraud and waste. One goal: ensuring availability of broadband for all low-income Americans. The term "Obama phones" has been attached to Lifeline since at least late 2009, when PolitiFact rated as Mostly False a chain email claim that Obama was giving away free phones. More famously, a viral video during the 2012 presidential campaign showed an Obama supporter saying "Everybody in Cleveland -- low (income), minority -- got Obama phones." Soon after, PolitiFact gave a Florida state official a Pants on Fire rating for saying the Obama campaign was giving out phones. Both of those PolitiFact ratings cited the fact that the program existed years before Obama took office, so implying he created the program was incorrect. Stockman’s tweet similarly linked the program to Obama but added a financial factor: "He's spending $2.2 billion to give away ‘ObamaPhones.’ " Stockman spokesman Donny Ferguson emailed us a Feb. 12, 2013, Wall Street Journal news story that said, "The U.S. government spent about $2.2 billion last year to provide phones to low-income Americans ... Payouts under the program have shot up from $819 million in 2008, as more wireless carriers have persuaded regulators to let them offer the service." Wigfield sent us the FCC’s total spending figures for Lifeline in recent years: 2007: $823 million 2008: $821 million 2009: $1 billion 2010: $1.13 billion 2011: $1.78 billion 2012: $2.1 billion The post-2008 boom, he said, came after the FCC decided to open Lifeline to phone companies offering low-cost cell plans on networks they did not own. Tracfone was the first such provider to become an eligible carrier for Lifeline, he said. The Journal article said Tracfone has since become the country’s fifth-largest wireless carrier and that other companies have expanded as "Lifeline users have been a source of subscriber growth in the otherwise saturated U.S. market." Our ruling Stockman said Obama’s "spending $2.2 billion to give away ‘ObamaPhones.’ " That figure’s about right for 2012 federal spending on the Lifeline program, but as PolitiFact has noted before, attributing it to Obama is incorrect. It’s important to note, too, that the money comes from phone fees, so it wouldn’t be possible to prevent public safety cuts by halting the phone program. The tradeoff Stockman asserts isn’t valid. We rate his statement as Mostly False.	None	Steve Stockman	None	None	None	2013-03-15T14:56:10	2013-02-22	['None']
pomt-01363	Some doctors say Ebola can be transmitted through the air by "a sneeze or some cough."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/oct/19/george-will/george-will-claims-sneeze-cough-spread-ebola/	As the national effort ramps up to beat back Ebola, the Obama administration has been taking heat. Critics say the president and top public health officials painted too rosy a picture of the country’s state of readiness. As proof, they point to the infection of two Dallas health care workers who treated the first person to die of Ebola on U.S. soil. Conservative pundit George Will attacked what to him was the hubris in those early statements. "The problem is the original assumption, said with great certitude if not certainty, was that you need to have direct contact, meaning with bodily fluids from someone because it’s (Ebola) not airborne," Will said Oct. 19 on Fox News Sunday. "There are doctors who are saying that in a sneeze or some cough, some of the airborne particles can be infectious." Will also said Ebola could survive on a dry surface "for a number of days." Show host Chris Wallace cut Will off, asserting that Ebola does not spread like the flu, which does move from person to person when someone with the illness is out in public. When another guest challenged Will to cite his source, he ultimately referred to scientists at the University of Minnesota. Here, we’re fact-checking Will’s claim that scientists say a cough or sneeze can spread Ebola. From the context of the discussion, we understand that Will was talking about the risk to the general public. We reached out to Will and did not hear back but thanks to the rumor website Snopes, we have a pretty good idea where he got his information. In mid September, the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy posted a commentary from two University of Illinois professors. The commentary, co-written by Lisa Brosseau and Rachel Jones, argued that health care workers treating patients with Ebola should wear respirators. Face masks, they said, are not enough. We asked Brosseau if Will had correctly relayed her work. Brosseau said her views had nothing to do with Ebola spreading among the public at large. The focus was on health care workers treating people in the isolation wards. "We were concerned about aerosols generated by infected patients in the most severe stage of the disease," Brosseau said. Will had mistakenly connected the pathway of infection in a hospital room with someone coughing or sneezing in public. As has been well documented, the first symptom of infection is a fever. As the virus multiplies in the body, vomiting and diarrhea set in. Brosseau had written that it is possible that for patients in that condition, tiny water particles from violent vomiting and diarrhea could get into the air and be inhaled. In a laboratory experiment, monkeys with hoods over their heads could acquire the Ebola virus, but Brosseau said that lab experiments should be put in context. "We are not aware of any published data about the viability or infectiousness of the Ebola organism in aerosols in the real world," Brosseau told PunditFact. "It appears unlikely that the public will be exposed to infectious aerosols because they are not likely to encounter infected people experiencing the severe symptoms." We found similar views in the Oxford Journal of Infectious Diseases, and summaries issued by the Centers for Disease Control , the World Health Organization and the New England Journal of Medicine. Adam Lauring, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Michigan, emphasized that Ebola is not a respiratory disease. Coughing and sneezing are not symptoms in the way that they are with the flu. Stephen Gire, a research scientist in the Sabeti Lab at Harvard University, said if someone with Ebola sneezed or coughed into your face when you were close to them, that could transmit the virus through droplets. But, "It’s important to note that this form of transmission does not constitute 'airborne,' " Gire said. "This is still a form of direct contact." "If you were on a plane, and someone sneezed, you wouldn’t be at risk of getting infected unless you were sneezed on directly within close quarters, and that cough or sneeze transferred droplets into mucosal membranes. This is very unlikely scenario, but not out of the realm of possibility. I think I can count on one hand the number of times I’ve been sneezed on directly, and only one of those times was by someone I didn’t know." One of the problems with the public debate over Ebola, Lauring said, is that science can’t prove that something will never happen. On the other hand, he also said we ought to look at what has happened. "If airborne transmission was an imminent concern, one would have to ask why no one in the United States has been infected except for two people who had close contact with the patient," Lauring said. "Importantly, none of the people who were living with the patient prior to his second trip to thee Texas hospital have been infected." While we are not fact-checking Will’s statement about infectious particles remaining alive for several days on a dry surface, Lauring said he knows of no evidence of that. Gire said it's theoretically possible under the right conditions, though it's highly unlikely. Our ruling Will said that some scientists say that Ebola can be transmitted in public by a sneeze or a cough. The source of that was a commentary about the risks to hospital workers treating people in advanced stages of the disease. One of the authors of that commentary said her work applied only to health care workers in those settings. The medical literature says sneezing and coughing are not part of the disease’s typical symptoms, and experts we reached drew a bright line between what might happen in a hospital isolation ward and a person with early symptoms of Ebola before he or she is admitted. There is no evidence that Ebola has been transmitted in the general public through coughing or sneezing. Will took a medical commentary out of context. We rate the claim False. Update (Noon, Oct. 20): After we published this item, we heard from some folks who disagreed with our ruling. Read our response here.

pomt-02486	The words "subhuman mongrel," which Ted Nugent called President Barack Obama, were used by the Nazis to "justify the genocide of the Jewish community."	true	/punditfact/statements/2014/feb/18/wolf-blitzer/wolf-blitzer-ted-nugent-used-nazi-terminology-subh/	Ted Nugent may have made his name as a rock musician, but today he increasingly is known for his controversial comments about President Barack Obama. At a January gun expo in Las Vegas, Nugent described Obama as "a communist-raised, communist-educated, communist-nurtured, subhuman mongrel." Nugent now is campaigning with Texas Republican gubernatorial candidate Greg Abbott. This led CNN’s Wolf Blitzer to question whether the Abbott campaign understands the history of such language. (Abbott has not distanced himself from Nugent.) "That’s what the Nazis called Jews to justify the genocide of the Jewish community," Blitzer said in a Feb. 18, 2014, interview. "They called them untermenschen, subhuman mongrels. If you read some of the literature that the Nazis put out there, there is a long history of that specific phrase he used involving the president of the United States." Blitzer’s interview made waves through the political world, so we wanted to check his assertion about the words "subhuman mongrel." In his CNN interview, Blitzer cited the work of Nazi party official Julius Streicher. But our research shows Blitzer is correct well beyond an individual Nazi party official. The words subhuman and mongrel were used interchangeably but generally had the same derogatory meaning. David Myers, a historian at the University of California at Los Angeles, said Adolph Hitler used the word "untermensch" or subhuman in his book Mein Kampf in 1925. "From that point forward, it was part of the Nazi lexicon," Myers said. "That and ‘mischling’ or mongrel, were intoned with daily regularity by the Nazi propaganda machine." The man Blitzer mentioned, Streicher, was an early Nazi party leader in Nuremberg and Franconia and a fierce anti-Semite. In the mid 1920s, he began publishing a tabloid aimed at the working class called Der Sturmer, "The Attacker." The front of each edition carried the slogan, "The Jews are our misfortune." In 1935, Der Sturmer carried a student essay that parrotted the teaching materials in the classroom. Here is the English translation: "Regrettably, there are still many people today who say: Even the Jews are creatures of God. Therefore you must respect them. But we say: Vermin are animals too, but we exterminate them just the same. The Jew is a mongrel. He has hereditary tendencies from Aryans, Asiatics, Negroes, and from the Mongolians. Evil always preponderates in the case of a mongrel." In 1899, the English anti-Semite Houston Stewart Chamberlain wrote extensively about physical characteristics and race. He claimed "the Semites belong to the mulatto class, a transition stage between black and white" and were "a mongrel race which always retains this mongrel character." In 1942, the Nazis printed an infamous pamphlet, Der Untermensch, which translates to "subhuman." The Holocaust Research Project translation provides this front panel quote from the head of the German SS, Heinrich Himmler: "As long as there have been men on the Earth, the struggle between man and the subhuman will be the historic rule; the Jewish-led struggle against the mankind, as far back as we can look, is part of the natural course of life on our planet. One can be convinced with full certainty that this struggle for life and death is just as much a law of nature as is the struggle of an infection to corrupt a healthy body." Mark Roseman, director of the Borns Jewish Studies Program at Indiana University, said the German word for subhuman, untermensch, did not tend to be used by the Nazis in the adjectival form. So the words weren't often used in combination. "But the underlying claim, namely, that Nazi policies were preceded, facilitated, and accompanied by language that compared Jews to animals, and declared them to be subhuman, is of course absolutely correct," Roseman said. Our ruling Blitzer said the words "subhuman mongrel" were used by the Nazis to "justify the genocide of the Jewish community." We found ample evidence that the Nazis used those words -- in their own language -- to repeatedly describe Jewish people in the build-up to the Holocaust. We rate his statement True.

pomt-03466	"Seventy percent of the people in the state of New Jersey want marriage equality."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2013/jun/16/stephen-sweeney/steve-sweeney-says-70-percent-new-jerseyans-want-m/	There’s no denying that support for same-sex marriage has grown in New Jersey during the past few years. Polls done on the issue show that support for it has climbed above 50 percent and is nearing a two-thirds majority, according to recent results released by a handful of major polling organizations. The consenus is so strong, according to Senate President Steve Sweeney (D-Gloucester), that New Jersey may be headed toward a number indicating support from three-quarters of state residents. "Seventy percent of the people in the state of New Jersey want marriage equality," Sweeney said during an interview earlier this month on NJTV’s ‘On The Record with Michael Aron.’ Sweeney, who abstained when a same-sex marriage bill came before the Legislature three years ago, now supports it. The 70 percent figure would be the highest level of support for same-sex marriage ever polled in New Jersey – if it were true. But it’s not. Let’s begin by reviewing polls done in New Jersey on same-sex marriage. Back in April, the Rutgers-Eagleton poll asked 819 registered voters if they would vote for legalizing same-sex marriage if the question appeared on a ballot. Of those who answered, 62 percent said yes, 30 percent said no and 8 percent were undecided, said David Redlawsk, director of the Rutgers-Eagleton Polling Institute and a political science professor at Rutgers University. The poll had a margin of error of +/- 3.7 percent. We then checked with the Quinnipiac Polling Institute, which had a slightly higher approval rating for this question asked in March: Would you support or oppose a law that would allow same-sex couples to get married? The poll found 64 percent of registered voters in favor, the highest level Quinnipiac has seen in response to that exact question since 2006, when support was at 41 percent. Thirty percent were opposed. The same poll found that 72 percent of New Jerseyans say it’s a good idea to decide the same-sex marriage issue by referendum on the November ballot. Let’s be clear: Sweeney’s claim of 70 percent support only rings true when voters are asked if same-sex marriage should go on the ballot. Favorability for same-sex marriage is closer to 60 percent when voters are asked if they would support laws allowing it. Quinnipiac’s poll surveyed 1,129 registered voters and had a margin of error of +/-2.9 percent. The Monmouth University Poll also has polled on this topic and seen numbers near 60 percent that support same-sex marriage, with favorability increasing each year. "There has been a significant uptick in the last year or two," said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Poll. "We’re at the point now where we’re at a solid majority." Murray cited a number of reasons for the increase, including President Barack Obama publicly stating his support in May 2012 for same-sex marriage. "It was naturally going in that direction," Murray said. "When the president made his statement it kind of cemented that. We saw an immediate uptick in African-American support." But even as that support grows, neither Redlawsk nor Murray said they’ve seen approval numbers hitting the 70 percent mark claimed by Sweeney. Quinnipiac also hasn’t seen support that high. We also looked at other polls to gauge national support and those numbers didn’t approach 70 percent, either. A May Gallup poll found that 53 percent of Americans said the law should recognize same-sex marriage, marking the third time Gallup has measured a reading above 50 percent on the issue. The poll surveyed 1,535 adults nationwide and had a margin of error of +/- 3 percent. The poll asked: Do you think marriages between same-sex couples should or should not be recognized by the law as valid, with the same rights as traditional marriages? An October Pew Research Center poll, done two weeks before the November 2012 general election, found different regions of the country had widely disparate attitudes on same-sex marriage. Mid-Atlantic states (Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Washington, DC) favored same-sex marriage 57 percent to 34 percent, the poll showed. New England states had the highest level of support, at 62 percent. Chris Donnelly, a spokesman for New Jersey Senate Democrats who responded to our initial request for comment from Sweeney, did not answer our question about the source of Sweeney’s number. Our ruling Sweeney said during a recent TV interview, "Seventy percent of the people in the state of New Jersey want marriage equality." It’s clear that support for same-sex marriage is growing, but it’s not at the level mentioned by Sweeney. A number of polls on the topic cite support ranging from just below 60 percent to a high of 64 percent, and two New Jersey polling directors say they have never seen support levels for same-sex marriage hit 70 percent. National polls also indicate lower support levels. We rate the claim False. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.	None	Stephen Sweeney	None	None	None	2013-06-16T07:30:00	2013-06-01	['New_Jersey']
pomt-02931	"West Linn has one of the highest per capita rates of home-based businesses in the United States."	false	/oregon/statements/2013/oct/31/julie-parrish/west-linn-national-leader-number-home-businesses-p/	For more than a decade, economists have charted a pronounced trend toward more home-based businesses. Nationally, the number of people working from home increased by 2 million from 2005 to 2010, according to the U.S. Census. In Oregon, the city of West Linn has long claimed a relatively high number of home-based businesses, with City Council members and others routinely referring to the city as having one of the highest rates per capita in the state. Rep. Julie Parrish, R-West Linn, took things to a new level during the recent legislative special session, when she spoke on the floor to support a small-business tax cut. She said the proposed cuts would save enough for many businesses to hire an additional employee, then added, "West Linn has one of the highest per capita rates of home-based businesses in the United States." That caught our attention. Does West Linn’s per capita rate of home-based businesses top almost anywhere in the country? PolitiFact Oregon decided to check. We contacted Parrish by email and received a quick reply. She cited a May 2, 2013, article in the West Linn Tidings newspaper. The article, referring to U.S. Census data, stated that West Linn ranked second in Oregon in the rate of home-based businesses per capita at 8.9 percent. Only Lake Oswego, at 10.9 percent, ranked higher. Parrish offered additional figures to bolster her case. As of April, she said, 2,769 businesses with West Linn addresses were registered with the Oregon Secretary of State’s office. Further, West Linn has a population of about 25,600 and 9,779 households, according to the 2010 Census. Of those, 777 units are vacant. That leaves 2,769 businesses spread among about 9,000 households. Suitably crunched, those numbers indicate that about 28 percent of households have a registered business, Parrish said, adding, "Of course, not all of those are going to be home-based." From there, however, the slope got more slippery. We took Parrish up on her suggestion to contact West Linn City Councilor Thomas Frank, who, she said, had cited 2010 Census Bureau data for statewide numbers of home-based businesses in one of his recent blog posts. Frank said West Linn used to call itself Oregon’s leader when it came to the number of home-based businesses. He then cited the same figures used in the West Linn Tidings article. Asked whether West Linn had, as Parrish stated, one of the highest per capita rates in the nation, Frank said, "I’ve not heard that one before." Next, at Frank’s suggestion, we turned to Chris Kerr, West Linn’s economic development director. He also could not pinpoint the origin of West Linn’s reputation for having a high concentration of home-based businesses. "I have heard similar statements about the comparatively large number/percentage of home-based businesses in West Linn," Kerr wrote by email. "However, I am not familiar with any comparative data on this subject; certainly not related to the national averages or on a per capita basis." In the end, neither he, Frank nor anyone else contacted by PolitiFact Oregon could cite numbers supporting the notion that West Linn is a leader in home-based enterprises, even though that’s been the conventional wisdom for years. Kerr said the city probably does have a beefy number of home-based businesses because of its high percentage of residential to nonresidential land. The city last year listed 1,245 licensed businesses -- far fewer than the state listed for West Linn -- of which 423 were at residences. The discrepancy underscores the difficulty of finding precise numbers. Kerr noted that some of those homes were listed for mailing-address purposes only. Other home businesses don’t bother to get licenses in hopes of avoiding regulation or licensing fees. "I’ve been told that Southeast Portland has an unusually high number of home-based businesses, but there’s no way to prove it," said Eric Norberg, longtime president of the Association of Home Businesses in Portland. "Cities don’t tabulate that separately, and many home businesses have no desire to tell anyone but their customers what they are doing." Still, we wondered whether cities can be ranked according to their per capita rates of home-based businesses. Yes, said Jason Jurjevich, assistant director of Portland State University’s Population Research Center, but not by using full Census statistics. Instead, data along these lines come from the Economic Census, a survey of business owners conducted every five years. The problem is it’s a relatively small survey and doesn’t produce information down to cities the size of West Linn, Jurjevich said. The single source of information that could be used that way -- Public Use Microdata Sample, or PUMS -- requires population sets of at least 100,000. Of West Linn, he said: "It’s too small." The Census’ annual American Community Survey also gathers data from businesses and homeowners. In a question asking how many people work from home, 8.5 percent of West Linn respondents answered yes (not the 8.9 percent listed in the Tidings article). But there’s no way to determine how many are simply employees who work from home. To Parrish’s credit, she promised to continue looking for "the specific numbers," adding, "I’m willing to acknowledge that I don’t have them in hand." She stood by saying West Linn has "one of the highest" per capita ratings in Oregon, despite the fact that no one could point to specific data to back that up. But back to her original claim to House colleagues that West Linn has "one of the highest per capita rates of home-based businesses in the United States." It’s conceivably possible that’s true, but Parrish could offer no substantiation. And we found that no such statistics exist on a city the size of West Linn. In such cases, PolitiFact rates the claim False.	None	Julie Parrish	None	None	None	2013-10-31T16:54:36	2013-10-02	['United_States']
pomt-05554	Adding ethanol to gas "raises food costs."	mostly true	/tennessee/statements/2012/apr/06/james-durkan/tennessee-senate-candidate-says-putting-ethanol-ga/	Whether or not it’s a good idea to add ethanol to gasoline is a debate that has been around for years. One of the key disputes has been the impact ethanol-infused gas has on food supplies and food prices. Such highly charged topics often make great fodder for candidates looking to score a few political points, and U.S. Senate candidate James Durkan is one of the latest to thrust himself into the debate. Durkan, of Chattanooga, had intended to be one of the Republicans challenging U.S. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., in the state’s GOP primary, but was not successful in filing a qualifying petition (see note below). On his campaign website, Durkan outlines his three-step plan for lowering gas prices. One of his suggestions is to take ethanol out of gas. "Why put it in?" he wrote. "It raises food costs." We called Durkan and asked what sources he was using as the basis for his claim. "It’s common knowledge that it raises the price of food," he said. "Just say we got that information from various sources." Pressed further, Durkan refused to cite any sources for his statement. "We know that we’ve heard it, and we know that it’s true," he said. Asked again for his sources, Durkan replied, "I would rather just say radio and television and the newspaper." Saying something is "common knowledge" might be good enough for someone running for office, but not for PolitiFact Tennessee. So we decided to run Durkan’s claim through the Truth-o-Meter. First, a little background, courtesy of our colleagues at PolitiFact Wisconsin. Most gasoline is blended with 10 percent ethanol, a fuel made from corn. That’s part of federal legislation pushed by the corn growers, the ethanol industry and renewable fuels supporters that seeks to boost the amount of ethanol we burn in our cars. For decades, the industry was encouraged – and propped up – by a controversial package of tax credits, production mandates and tariffs. Last year, after a series of bitter political fights, Congress allowed the federal ethanol subsidies to expire. One reason for the political battle was the argument that ethanol diverted too much corn from food to fuel and that it caused food prices to rise. It also is worth noting that the percentage of corn used for fuel could rise -- an ethanol blend known as E15 passed a key regulatory hurdle on Monday. The Renewable Fuels Association, which lobbies for ethanol, has vigorously disputed that claim, arguing on its website that tremendous increases in the productivity of U.S. farmers have ensured ample supplies of grain are available for domestic and international use as food, feed and fuel. The association concedes that using corn to produce ethanol could impact food prices, but argues that other factors, such as energy costs, play a much bigger role in driving up the price of food. "No reasonable advocate for American ethanol will tell you that using corn to produce ethanol has no impact on food prices," the association wrote in a policy position on its web site. "But to suggest that the driving factor behind the rise in food prices is our effort to develop a domestic renewable ethanol industry is disingenuous." The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office looked into ethanol’s impact on food costs at the request of U.S. Reps. Ron Kind, D-Wis.; Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn.; and James McGovern, D-Mass. In its 2009 report, "The Impact of Ethanol Use on Food Prices and Greenhouse-Gas Emissions," the agency estimated that the increased use of ethanol accounted for about 10 to 15 percent of the rise in food prices between April 2007 and April 2008. The report also said ethanol boosted federal spending on programs to feed the needy by an estimated $600 million to $900 million. The reason: Nearly 3 billion bushels of corn were used to produce ethanol in the United States in 2008. That was an increase of nearly a billion bushels over the previous year. The demand for corn for ethanol production, along with other factors, exerted upward pressure on corn prices, which rose by more than 50 percent between April 2007 and April 2008. Rising demand for corn also increased the demand for cropland and the price of animal feed. Those effects in turn raised the price of many farm commodities, such as soybeans, meat, poultry and dairy products. That, in turn, raised the retail price of food. Pushed up in part by those effects and by surges in the price of energy, food prices rose by almost 2.5 percent in 2006, by 4 percent in 2007 and by 5.1 percent in 2008. But the report also noted that other factors, including transportation and energy costs, also had an impact on food prices. In fact, the report found that higher energy prices were more responsible for driving up the cost of food than ethanol production was. The increase in energy prices accounted for nearly a quarter (22 percent) of the 5.1 percent jump in food prices between 2007 and 2008, the report said. In 2011, Iowa State University economists Bruce A. Babcock and Jacinto F. Fabiosa reached a similar conclusion in their report, "The Impact of Ethanol and Ethanol Subsidies on Corn Prices: Revisiting History." "It is disingenuous to argue that there is no link between ethanol production and corn prices," the report said. "And there is a direct link between higher corn prices and food costs because higher corn prices translate directly into higher feed costs, which eventually translate into higher prices for meat, eggs and dairy products." However, "the price of corn is not solely determined by ethanol," the report noted. The expansion of corn ethanol from subsidies and market forces accounted for 36 percent of the average increase in corn prices from 2006 to 2009, the report concluded. But, "all other market forces counted for 64 percent of the corn price increase," the report said. Our ruling Studies show increased ethanol production has driven up the price of corn and other food commodities, such as soybeans, meat, poultry and dairy products. That, in turn, has contributed to a higher retail price of food. Yet those same studies show that other factors, particularly energy prices, have an even bigger impact on the cost of food than ethanol production. We rate the claim Mostly True. *The Tennessee Secretary of State's office now tells us that James Durkan did not file for U.S. Senate and is not a candidate. Durkan told us the day after the April 5 filing deadline that he had indeed filed and didn't understand why his name was not on the Secretary of State's list of candidates for the office. Durkan said he could not remember exactly when he filed his paperwork, but thought it was sometime in 2010. But Blake Fontenay, a spokesman for the Secretary of State's office, told us in an email on April 11 that candidates can start filing qualifying petitions up to 90 days before the filing deadline. Fontenay said Durkan missed the deadline to pick up a petition and file. Contacted again and asked for clarification, Durkan said simply: "We have no comment, sir."

In May, the account shared an image of what appears to be a great white breaching, soaring above the surf. "National Geographic’s photo of the year," the caption says. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The photo was posted by a Facebook account called "The Planet Today" and it’s been shared more than 300,000 times. The account did not immediately respond to a message seeking the source of the photo. National Geographic also did not immediately respond to an email asking about the Facebook post. However, searching for the image on Google reveals a number of posts that pre-date 2018. In February 2017, for example, a Twitter user tapped the image for some early-morning inspiration. "Do sharks complain about it being Monday?" he tweeted. "No, they are up early, biting stuff, chasing food, being scary, reminding everyone they’re a shark." The shark has shown up on Pinterest and blogs. But we couldn’t find any credible websites connecting it to National Geographic. National Geographic does has an annual Travel Photographer of the Year competition. The grand prize this year was awarded to Reiko Takahashi, who photographed a humpback whale. The shark wasn’t the photo of the year in 2016, either, when this same shark pic was making the rounds on social media. In December 2016, National Geographic posted a blog refuting a claim that the photo was its photo of the year—an award the magazine doesn’t have. But editor Daniel Stone took the opportunity to blast fake news as a "threat to those of us in the business of telling the truth." He also shared 14 real shark photos. Check them out here.

pomt-13063	Texas A&M University - Commerce "offers counseling, safe spaces for students who are afraid of President-elect Trump."	half-true	/texas/statements/2016/nov/17/sid-miller/sid-miller-says-texas-university-trump-safe-spaces/	Two days after the November 2016 elections, Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller took note on his Facebook page of a web post suggesting a Texas A&M University campus was offering counseling and "safe spaces for students who are afraid of President-elect Trump." Did the cowboy-hatted Republican, who was Donald Trump’s most-cited Texan in the days before the vote, highlight accurate information? Trump unexpectedly defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton on Nov. 8, 2016, after more than 18 months of a bitter campaign--and nationally after the election, at least 43 colleges and universities offered support services, according to news reports, with some reporting spurts in students seeking counseling. Miller, who gleefully received news on Nov. 9, 2016, that he was among individuals under Trump’s consideration for U.S. secretary of agriculture, carries a reputation for provocative social media posts, including a Facebook post suggesting a nuclear strike on "the Muslim world" and a Twitter post he later deleted and attributed to an outside employee calling Clinton a vulgar name. For our part, we noticed that on Nov. 10, 2016, Miller shared an article from the website IAmATexan.com, headlined "Texas university offers counseling, safe spaces for students who are afraid of president-elect Trump;" five days later, Miller’s pass-along had been shared by others more than 4,400 times. Web post refers to 'pinko-commie-coddling letter' "I never thought I’d see this in Texas," said the post from I Am A Texan, a right-leaning news blog that posts daily articles on Texas culture and national issues. The website’s article said that an email with an attached "pinko-commie-coddling letter" had been sent to the entire student body at Texas A&M University - Commerce. The university, which enrolled about 12,300 students in fall 2015, is in Hunt County, which Trump carried with 76 percent of the vote to Clinton’s 20 percent. And according to I Am A Texan, the letter offered counseling services to students with election-related stress, "outlining all the ways that the university was prepared to help its fragile students who can’t bear the thought of living now that Donald Trump has won the election." Administrator: No intent to focus on fears of Trump And did the university spell out ways for students to deal with fears of Trump? To get a fix on that, we reached out to Tomás Aguirre, the university's assistant vice president and dean of students; Aguirre’s digital signature was stamped on the email that included the attached letter. By phone, Aguirre confirmed the authenticity of the posted email, which was blank save this subject line: "An Open Letter to Students: How to De-Stress from Election." Aguirre also insisted there was no administration intent to focus on students fearful of the president-elect, who was not mentioned in the letter. Miller spokesman bemoans student 'wusses' We also emailed Miller’s office, and got a phone call in response from spokesman Todd Smith, who said, "Who else would they be offering emotional counseling to if not people opposed to Donald Trump being president?" Smith’s point: Trump fans would have been happy--not in need of counseling--after election day. "Commissioner Miller believes that the mere fact that college students need counseling after a presidential election is a sad commentary on the state of our nation and many of its young people," Smith said. "Commissioner Miller thinks they’re a bunch of wusses." University's letter So exactly what offer did the university make? By email, Aguirre sent us a copy of the original "open letter," pictured below, which he said was emailed to students on Nov. 10, 2016. The letter doesn’t mention Trump or any candidate by name. It opens by calling the national election cycle "a particularly stressful one." Next, it says the Counseling Center staff "wants to acknowledge a range of reactions you might be experiencing Including excitement, joy, relief, fear, sadness, anger, dread, hopelessness, anxiety, and numbness." The letter’s second paragraph opens: "We are here to listen and support you as our nation works through this election transition." It goes on to offer services especially to students "struggling with the impact of the election or the tone of the national discussion" and students who have experienced negative treatment because of "race or ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, religious affiliation, country of origin or other aspects of your identity." The letter closes with tips for students at "this highly emotional time for our nation" to remain productive. That comes after a sentence stating the center "provides a safe space for discussions on identity, empowerment, intercultural competency, and the impact of the election." By phone, Aguirre described the letter as a reminder of services available year-round. Also, he said, it was similar to letters distributed to students through the school year such as at mid-term exams and around Valentine’s Day. Aguirre said he put the letter in motion after the election because the school’s Counseling Center had seen an uptick in student visits during the fall 2016 semester. Aguirre said, though, that he he didn’t know if the spike related to the election; confidentiality constraints bar the university from saying why students seek counseling. A student's comment We wondered if students saw eye to eye with Aguirre regarding the undertones of the open letter. So we messaged the Facebook page for the College Republicans at Texas A&M University - Commerce, and got a response from Michael Faz, the group’s vice president. Faz, a senior majoring in political science, said by phone that Aguirre "sends those emails out all the time," up to a few times a month. Faz said he read the letter himself but doubted that most students did. The College Republicans on campus, Faz said, did not feel the reminder of support services was a message catered to students fearful of Trump. "We didn’t think anything of it," Faz said. Our ruling Miller posted an article saying Texas A&M University - Commerce was offering counseling and "safe spaces for students who are afraid of President-elect Trump." After the election, the university sent a letter to students describing its counseling center as a "safe space." Yet that letter didn’t specifically mention Trump while offering services for students experiencing varied reactions. We rate Miller’s statement Half True.

pomt-15212	Says Donald Trump has "changed his mind" on abortion.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/11/carly-fiorina/fiorina-trumps-abortion-flip-flop/	Of all the leading Republican candidates, Donald Trump’s credentials on the issue of abortion are the most spotty. Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina made sure to highlight this during the first Republican presidential debate. When asked about Trump’s top position in the polls, Fiorina explained that Trump has connected with a legitimate frustration. "Whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would (be) resolved, the political class has failed you," Fiorina said. "That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into. I would also just say this. Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?" In this fact-check, we assess whether Trump has changed his mind on abortion. Fiorina’s staff apparently was so sure this would come up, a day after the debate, they posted a page on their campaign website with supporting information. They cited articles from the Washington Post and National Journal that documented Trump’s shift from saying he was pro-choice to now saying he is pro-life. 'I am very pro-choice' Trump’s flirtations with a presidential bid have put him on record at various moments in a couple of election cycles. In 1999, he appeared on NBC’s Meet the Press, when he was thinking about a third-party run. "I am very pro-choice," Trump said. "I hate the concept of abortion. I hate it. I hate everything it stands for. I cringe when I hear people debating the subject." When pressed on whether he would ban a procedure called "partial-birth" by abortion foes, Trump said, "No. I would not. I am pro-choice in every respect as far as it goes, but I just hate it." In his 2000 book The America We Deserve, Trump affirmed his basic position, but reversed his stand on that one particular procedure. "There are some issues I don’t want to say much about. I support a woman’s right to choose, for example, but I am uncomfortable with the procedures. When Tim Russert asked me on Meet the Press if I would ban partial-birth abortion if I were president, my pro-choice instincts led me to say no. After the show, I consulted two doctors I respect and, upon learning more about this procedure, I have concluded that I would indeed support a ban." So, as of 2000, Trump has "pro-choice instincts." 'I'm pro-life' In mid February 2011, with Trump again fueling speculation that he would run for president, he spoke at the annual meeting of the Conservative Political Action Committee. In his 14-minute speech, he made this simple declaration: "I am pro-life." A few months later in April, he sat down with the Christian Broadcasting Network’s political correspondent, who asked if he would really stand by his new belief. Here is what Trump said: "One thing about me, I’m a very honorable guy. I’m pro-life, but I changed my view a number of years ago. One of the reasons I changed — one of the primary reasons — a friend of mine, his wife was pregnant, in this case married. She was pregnant, and ... he didn’t really want the baby. And he was telling me the story. He’s crying as he’s telling me. They ended up for some reason, amazingly, through luck because they didn’t have the right timing, he ends up having the baby, and the baby is the apple of his eye. He said, it’s the greatest thing that’s ever happened to him. And you know, here’s a baby that wasn’t going to be let into life. And I heard this, and some other stories, and I am pro-life." So, by 2011, Trump opposed abortion. These days, he often re-tells the story about his friend’s unplanned child. A curious interruption Trump clarified his stance on abortion in a January interview with Mark Halperin of Bloomberg News. Trump said the only exceptions to banning abortions would be to protect the life of the mother or in cases of incest or rape. But we noted this twist in that brief discussion: Trump: "With caveats, life of the mother, incest and rape. And that’s where I stand. So I’m pro-life, but with the caveats. It’s life of the mother,very important, incest and rape." Halperin: "So say a woman is pregnant and it’s not in any of those exception categories and she chooses to have an abortion, should she --" Trump: "It depends when, it depends when. It depends when." Halperin: "Well let’s say early in her pregnancy." Trump: "Excuse me. If it’s not in any of those -- pro-life. Mark it’s very simple. Pro-life." Trump interrupted Halperin to say "it depends when." We reached out to Trump’s campaign and asked what he meant. We did not hear back. Our ruling Fiorina said that Trump changed his mind on abortion, and by Trump’s own admission, that is accurate. As late as 2000, he wrote that he was pro-choice. By 2011, he said he was pro-life. Recently, he noted that he thinks exceptions for the life of the mother, incest and rape are appropriate. We find some murkiness in his repetition of "It depends when," but that doesn’t change the fundamental finding. We rate this claim True.

pomt-13763	Says Hillary Clinton "supported North American Free Trade Agreement), and she supported China’s entrance into the World Trade Organization…. She supported the job-killing trade deal with South Korea. She supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/21/donald-trump/donald-trumps-largely-accurate-about-clintons-past/	At the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Donald Trump repeated his months-long criticism of Hillary Clinton’s past support of free trade deals, a position in stark contrast to his own. (Trump says his superior negotiating skills will result in better deals.) "She supported (the North American Free Trade Agreement), and she supported China’s entrance into the World Trade Organization — another one of her husband’s colossal mistakes. She supported the job-killing trade deal with South Korea. She supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership." This is largely accurate, but it’s worth noting that Clinton no longer supports NAFTA or TPP, nor is it clear that the South Korean deal is a job-killer. Let’s go through Clinton’s position on these deals one by one. NAFTA As first lady, Clinton spoke favorably of NAFTA — the North American Free Trade Agreement — signed by President Bill Clinton. "I think everybody is in favor of free and fair trade. I think NAFTA is proving its worth," said Clinton, according to a 1996 Associated Press report. "Creating a free trade zone in North America — the largest free trade zone in the world — would expand U.S. exports, create jobs and ensure that our economy was reaping the benefits, not the burdens, of globalization," she wrote in her 2003 memoir, Living History, which the Trump campaign cited in a press release. "Although unpopular with labor unions, expanding trade opportunities was an important administration goal." But a few years later, she changed her position on the deal during her first White House bid. In 2007, she called NAFTA a "mistake" and said it "hurt a lot of American workers." Why the change of heart? According to the 2008 Clinton camp, she was always skeptical of the deal. But the first lady was "not supposed to deviate from the position of the administration," Robert Shapiro, the undersecretary of commerce under Bill Clinton, told the Huffington Post. China’s inclusion in the WTO While campaigning for Senate in 2000, Clinton voiced reservations about China’s entrance into the WTO, but was supportive overall. Here’s what she said at a CNN forum in April of that year, which was cited by the Trump campaign: "I share the concerns that many of my supporters in organized labor have expressed to me, because I do think we have to make sure that we improve labor rights, we improve environmental standards in our bilateral and our multilateral trade agreements. But on balance, I've looked at this, I've studied it, I think it is in the interests of America and American workers that we provide the option for China to go into the WTO. Right now, we are trading with China. We have a huge trade deficit with China. The agreement that has been negotiated between our two countries would open their markets to us in a way that they are not yet open, and in fact, for many large manufactured products, like automobiles, we would have the first chance to really get in and compete in that marketplace." (According to news reports from 1999, then-Reform Party member Trump opposed the United States’ inclusion in the WTO, period.) China became a member of the WTO in December 2001, with the support of President George W. Bush. Since then, Clinton hasn’t reversed her position, as far as we can tell, but has advocated for using the WTO to bring trade cases against China. (This is also Trump’s current position.) Deal with South Korea During her 2008 presidential run, Clinton opposed a pending free trade deal with South Korea (as well as other deals with Colombia and Panama). "While I value the strong relationship the United States enjoys with South Korea, I believe that this agreement is inherently unfair," she told the AFL-CIO in June 2007. "The South Korean agreement does not create a level playing field for American carmakers," she said in a November 2007 campaign statement. But as secretary of state, she supported the deal advocated by the administration. At an April 2011 gathering of business leaders in Seoul, Clinton said the deal was "profoundly in America's strategic interest" and "a priority for me, for President Obama and for the entire administration." (In 2008, Obama also was against the deal.) When the deal entered into force in March 2012, Clinton touted it as a "historic milestone" that will "provide a significant economic boost to both of our economies" and "strengthen the U.S. partnership with a key ally in a strategically important region." Does this deal kill jobs, as Trump says? The jury is still out. On one hand, the Economic Policy Institute, a labor-focused think tank, which Trump has cited, has found that the South Korean deal cost about 60,000 U.S. jobs. On the other, the Obama administration has argued the deal actually creates jobs. Our friends at the Washington Post Fact-Checker, meanwhile, looked at the the evidence and found both estimates of job losses and job gains are fishy. An independent analysis by economists at Tufts University and the University of Michigan projected a decline in manufacturing and service jobs and an increase in agriculture and food, beverage and tobacco jobs. But overall, the net impact on employment would be zero. TPP As we’ve detailed quite extensively, Clinton once hailed TPP as setting "the gold standard in trade agreements" during her time in the Obama administration, but she came out in opposition during her 2016 bid. Though she’s always said the details needed to be hammered out, her comments about the deal were largely supportive from 2010 to 2013. Here are some of the words she used to describe TPP: "exciting," "innovative," "ambitious," "groundbreaking," "cutting-edge," "high quality," "high standard" and "gold standard." In October 2015, Clinton flip-flopped and opposed it, telling PBS, "I don’t believe it’s going to meet the high bar I have set." Our ruling Trump said Clinton "supported NAFTA, and she supported China’s entrance into the World Trade Organization…. She supported the job-killing trade deal with South Korea. She has supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership." Trump is right that Clinton once supported NAFTA and TPP and has yet to revoke her support for China’s inclusion in the WTO or the deal with South Korea. But there are caveats. Clinton no longer supports NAFTA or TPP, and it’s not entirely clear that trade with South Korea has killed jobs. Trump’s statement is accurate because it’s carefully phrased, but it needs additional context. We rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/68c1a4d5-56ad-4a84-87b6-564b5037df5b	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-07-21T23:27:09	2016-07-21	['South_Korea', 'North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement', 'China', 'Asia-Pacific_Economic_Cooperation']
pomt-03787	"In this city, there hasn’t been a stadium that’s lasted more than 27 years."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/mar/29/cleta-winslow/does-councilwoman-score-stadium-longevity-claim/	Some critics of the proposed $1 billion stadium in downtown Atlanta have raised questions about the idea. One question that keeps surfacing: "What’s wrong with the Georgia Dome?" Atlanta City Councilwoman Cleta Winslow tried to answer that question during a March 18 council meeting in which she voted in favor of the financial framework for a new stadium. The measure passed 11-4. The Georgia Dome may seem spry to some. But in stadium years, it’s pretty old, Winslow said. "It may be a young stadium, but in this city, there isn’t a stadium that’s lasted more than 27 years," she said. The Georgia Dome opened in 1992. We wondered how did Winslow’s math stack up when applied to other Atlanta sports facilities? Winslow later mentioned the old Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium and the Omni Arena in her remarks during the council meeting. Her council district includes several southwest Atlanta neighborhoods near Turner Field, home of the Atlanta Braves. Twenty-three of the 30 stadiums currently used by National Football League teams are younger than the Georgia Dome. The New York Giants and Jets share use of MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. Most of the older stadiums have been renovated. The San Francisco 49ers are moving into a new stadium under construction in Santa Clara, Calif. Now, back to Atlanta. Let’s begin with three venues that were built a century ago or more. The councilwoman was referring to professional sports facilities in the city, so she was not referring to venues such as Georgia Tech’s Bobby Dodd Stadium at Historic Grant Field, which was built in 1913. The stadium’s most recent renovation was completed in 2003. A minor-league baseball team, the Atlanta Crackers, played at Ponce de Leon Park from 1907 to 1965. The stadium had a seating capacity of 20,000, making it one of the largest minor-league facilities in the country. The bleachers were segregated by race. Babe Ruth once hit a home run into dead center field (462 feet), where a giant magnolia tree stood. The park was torn down in 1966. The site is now a retail shopping center anchored by a Home Depot. That stadium was in use for 58 years and stood for 59. In 1909, the Atlanta Municipal Auditorium opened. It was used for cultural events, an armory, a soup kitchen during the Great Depression, speeches by Presidents Teddy and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and Grateful Dead concerts. It was also used for some sports events. The giant ivory structure was the venue for wrestling matches in the 1950s. It was also the site of Muhammad Ali’s return to the fight game in 1970, after his boxing license was reinstated in Georgia. Ali scored a technical knockout over Jerry Quarry, who seemed to spill more blood than land punches in that bout. The building, located at what’s now Gilmer and Courtland streets in downtown Atlanta, was sold to Georgia State University in 1980 and is now its Alumni Hall. There are currently three pro sports franchises who play within the city limits, the Braves, Falcons and Hawks. The Omni Colesium was built in 1972 and was home to the Atlanta Hawks. It was also home to the National Hockey League’s Atlanta Flames from 1972 to 1980, before they moved to Calgary. In the mid- to late 1980s, Hawks home games were the hottest ticket in town as fans poured in to see star forward Dominique Wilkins, who was known as the Human Highlight Film for his acrobatic dunks and prolific scoring. The Omni became history in 1997, 25 years after it opened. Its eventual replacement, Philips Arena, opened in 1999. Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium opened in 1965. It's original name was Atlanta Stadium. The Crackers played there that year. The Braves moved there in 1966. For years, it was home to the Braves and Falcons. Baseball fans -- who grew used to seeing home runs hit there by Hank Aaron and other Braves power hitters -- knew it as the Launching Pad. In 1997, the Braves moved across the street to Turner Field, which was initially built for track and field events for the 1996 Summer Olympics. After 32 years of service, the old Launching Pad was turned into a parking lot. Winslow said through a City Council spokesman that she made an error. To sum up, the councilwoman said there hasn’t been a stadium in Atlanta that’s lasted more than 27 years, referring to sports facilities used by professional teams. Most pro football stadiums are younger than the Georgia Dome. In Atlanta, Winslow was correct on the Omni but off by five years when you consider Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium.

pomt-09215	"Taxpayer-funded benefits to illegals" in California are "a skyrocketing cost under Obamacare."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/19/steve-poizner/california-gop-candidate-blames-obama-health-care-/	The Republican primary to succeed Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) as governor of California has spawned a flood of ads attacking both Meg Whitman, the former CEO of eBay, and Steve Poizner, the state insurance commissioner -- the two frontrunners for the nomination. One ad, aired by Poizner beginning in April, argues that "like Schwarzenegger," Whitman "will continue taxpayer-funded benefits to illegals. A skyrocketing cost under Obamacare." We'll acknowledge some uncertainty about the statement's meaning because of its somewhat curious syntax. (Confusing matters further, the first sentence is read by a man, and the subsequent fragment by a woman.) However, we believe a reasonable person would interpret it to mean that a policy of continuing "taxpayer-funded benefits to illegals" would mean "a skyrocketing cost" due to the newly passed federal health care law. Whitman's press office did not respond to several inquiries from PolitiFact. The candidate's website does not directly address the question of whether she would continue "taxpayer-funded benefits to illegals" in the health care realm, though it does say that she advocates curbing state benefits for illegal immigrants in two other areas -- barring them from attending state-funded colleges and universities and preventing them from securing drivers' licenses. As for the question of whether the federal health care law will lead to skyrocketing costs, it would be incorrect to say that the new federal law is poised to increase California's costs directly. Written into the federal law is a clearly worded provision that prevents illegal immigrants from taking advantage of the law's benefits, such as the health care exchanges where uninsured Americans can compare plans and purchase coverage. But the Poizner campaign argues that the new law could have an indirect impact on California's deeply strained budget. The federal bill expands Medicaid eligibility to all Americans earning up to 133 percent of the poverty line. "This will lead to more illegal immigrants enrolling, because California provides a version of Medicaid to illegal immigrants," Poizner's campaign press secretary, Bettina Inclán, told PolitiFact. But it's wrong to assume that illegal immigrants will qualify for full-blown Medicaid in California. In fact, the only entitlement they get from Medicaid is emergency care in hospitals, which is already mandatory under federal law and was not changed by the newly passed health care bill. These limited benefits are available to any illegal immigrant who would otherwise qualify for Medicaid were it not for their immigration status. (Illegal immigrants can also qualify for Medicaid benefits for long-term care, but it's not an entitlement -- coverage is provided only to the extent that legislators and the governor agree to fund the program, and there's no federal match.) Right now, emergency care for illegal immigrants in California is paid by the state and local government. To the extent that more illegal immigrants will now qualify for California's version of Medicaid (known as Medi-Cal) and use emergency hospital services, the only difference will be a shift of payment responsibility from one state or local account to another. (Whether the federal government will continue to pick up part of the cost for treating illegal immigrants using Medi-Cal -- as the federal government does today -- is unclear, given the new bill's language.) Take pregnancy care. There shouldn't be any new costs, because Medi-Cal already covers pregnant women up to 185 percent of the poverty line, which is more generous than the 133 percent in the federal law. As a result, undocumented immigrants who need emergency delivery would already have been on emergency Medicaid anyway. The Poizner campaign has a point that coverage of emergency care for illegal immigrants -- including pregnancy costs -- is not cheap, costing upwards of $800 million a year. And that amount seems destined to rise, judging by the recent history of inflation in the health care sector and perhaps an increase in the number of illegal immigrants residing in the state. So the state's burden for providing health care to illegal immigrants may go up, but it is not accurate for the Poizner campaign to blame that development either on the new federal health care law or on the Democratic president who pushed for it. The new federal law specifically prevents illegal immigrants from benefitting, and most of the additional indirect costs that might be expected from expanding the Medicaid rolls are already being paid in California by different state or local government accounts. For these reasons, the phrase "a skyrocketing cost under Obamacare" is a gross exaggeration. We rate the statement False.

pomt-10570	In the Illinois Legislature, Barack Obama "voted 'present,' instead of yes or no" on seven votes involving abortion rights.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/06/hillary-clinton/he-voted-present-which-is-similar-to-no/	As the Democratic race has tightened, the Hillary Clinton campaign has portrayed Sen. Barack Obama as inconsistent on abortion rights. "In the Illinois state Senate, on issue after issue, my opponent voted 'present,' instead of yes or no. Seven of those votes were on a women's right to choose," Sen. Clinton said in a December 2007 speech in Iowa. In the days leading up to Super Tuesday on Feb. 5, 2008, several other groups repeated the charge against Obama via e-mails. The facts here are not in dispute. Obama did vote present on seven bills that attempted to restrict abortion. His defenders argue that it was a tactic to disrupt legislation that would be used against Democrats in swing districts. It's worth pausing here to explain what the "present" vote means. The Illinois Legislature allows members to vote "yes," "no," or "present." Bills need "yes" votes to pass, so a vote of "present" counts the same as a "no." Thus, Obama's "present" votes on bills seeking to restrict abortion counted the same as if he had voted "no." All of the bills passed by in the Senate by sizable margins. The seven votes were on proposals that abortion opponents have successfully passed in other places. Two bills outlawed the late-term procedure that opponents call partial-birth abortion. Two bills required parental notification for minors seeking abortions. Three bills were for so-called "born alive" legislation, which require doctors to administer medical care to aborted fetuses that survive the abortion process in hopes that the fetuses can survive. No one questions that Obama opposed the seven pieces of legislation; indeed, he is mentioned in news reports from the time as being against several of the measures. Rather, Obama's critics say he ducked a "no" vote; supporters say it was a tactical move. Those interpretations seem to have split the leaders of the Illinois abortion rights movement. Obama should have voted "no" on those bills, said Bonnie Grabenhofer, president of the Illinois chapter of the National Organization for Women, which has endorsed Clinton. "We think the way you talk about a bill and the way you stand up is important," she said. "It was a strategy that allowed people to take political cover as opposed to talking about why the bill was a bad bill and clearly saying no." But Pam Sutherland, president and CEO of the Illinois Planned Parenthood Council, said Obama was helping advance a prochoice agenda by voting present. "He always was going to vote 'no' on these bills. We needed to keep some of our moderate Democrats from voting yes, which is something you never want to happen," Sutherland said. By having a well-known supporter of abortion rights also vote present, it gave other Democrats cover, she said. Regardless of the interpretation of the "present" votes, Obama has received extremely positive ratings from organizations that promote abortion rights. Even Grabenhofer's organization, the NOW Illinois political action committee, endorsed Obama twice after the "present" votes. The group did not endorse in the U.S. Senate race in 2004, she said, in part because of the present votes. Steve Trombley of Planned Parenthood in Chicago has defended Obama's prochoice bona fides, even though Planned Parenthood has not endorsed in the race. "Barack Obama has always been committed to a woman's right to choose. He has a 100 percent pro-choice voting record both in the U.S. Senate and the Illinois Senate," Trombley wrote in a statement posted on the Obama campaign Web site. "I don't know why Illinois NOW has changed its opinion of Barack Obama since his record has remained the same and since his time as a state senator, he has only demonstrated a full and steady commitment to choice," Trombley added. Both Clinton and Obama have their supporters among the abortion rights movement. Clinton arguably has the bigger endorsements. She has been endorsed by the National Organization for Women and EMILY's List, an organization dedicated to electing prochoice women. Obama has some high-profile endorsements as well, such as Kate Michelman, former president, NARAL Prochoice America, who sided with Obama after John Edwards dropped out of the race. Obama also has the support of U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the first executive director of EMILY's List, who has publicly defended Obama as a strong supporter of abortion rights. We checked her statement here and found it to be True. Two other large groups, NARAL Prochoice America and Planned Parenthood, are not endorsing. Planned Parenthood, however, has given both candidates 100 percent ratings for their records on abortion. We stipulate that there are clearly different interpretations of the significance of Obama's "present" votes. But there's no doubt he made them. So we find Clinton's statement to be True.

pomt-14913	The CNBC debate was supposed to be three hours, and he "renegotiated it down to two hours."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/02/donald-trump/donald-trump-v-john-harwood-length-cnbc-debate/	The third GOP presidential debate would have been a lot longer if it weren’t for Donald Trump, he said. In his closing remarks at the Oct. 28 debate, the real estate mogul touted his deal-making skills, saying he and fellow candidate Ben Carson negotiated with CNBC to cut the debate down to two hours instead of three. "We called in, we said, that’s it, we’re not doing it," Trump said. "They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn’t be done. Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three-and-a-half, including (CNBC). And in about two minutes, I renegotiated it down to two hours so we could get the hell out of here." Moderator John Harwood disagreed and said, "Just for the record, the debate was always going to be two hours." But Trump held his ground: "That is absolutely not right. You know that. That is not right." So is Trump right, or is Harwood? We found that Trump is embellishing his story. Three hours? CNBC first announced the debate Sept. 30, but the negotiations over logistics didn’t happen until mid October. A September press release said "candidates will take the stage at 8PM ET for two hours of debate." While this bolsters Harwood’s claim, this count didn’t include commercial time -- so there would be a certain amount of time for advertising on top of the two hours of actual debate. But CNBC never anticipated the whole program would last anywhere near three or more hours. CNBC said the total anticipated commercial time was just 15 minutes, so the whole program (pre-negotiations) would have lasted around two hours and 15 minutes. Two weeks later, some GOP candidates complained about the debate logistics -- notably that there would be no opening or closing remarks, according to news reports. The Trump and Carson campaigns went so far as to send a letter to CNBC’s Washington bureau, threatening to drop out if their demands weren’t met. "Mr. Trump and Carson do agree to a 120 minute debate that includes commercial breaks and opening and closing statements," the Oct. 15 letter reads. "Mr. Trump and Mr. Carson do not, and will not, agree to appear at a debate that is more than 120 minutes long including commercial breaks." The letter also indicates that Trump’s campaign was aware the program would last about two hours, even with commercials. "Specifically, we write because the agenda sent to the campaigns recently by CNBC in partnership with the Republican National Committee (RNC), and reiterated on yesterday’s call, indicated that there would be ‘two hours of debate time’ plus four commercial breaks lasting between two and four minutes each," the letter said. The next day, CNBC agreed to cap the program at 120 minutes and for candidates to have 30 seconds at the beginning and the end. We can’t speak to how much of a role Trump directly played in the negotiation. We asked spokespeople at CNBC and the Republican National Committee about this, but neither would talk on the record. However, it’s fair to infer that his threatening to drop out of the debate probably put some pressure on leadership with the RNC and CNBC. In any case, Trump and the Republicans didn’t negotiate down an hour and a half; they negotiated 15 minutes. So in saying "the debate was always going to be two hours," Harwood’s statement was closer to accurate than Trump’s. Our ruling Trump said the CNBC debate was supposed to be three hours, and he "renegotiated it down to two hours." Trump played a role -- but not the sole role -- in negotiating the debate program down to two hours, but the plans were for it to last around two hours and 15 minutes -- not three hours or more. We rate Trump’s statement Mostly False.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2015-11-02T17:08:09	2015-10-28	['None']
pomt-08438	"Roy Barnes proclaimed Mexican workers good for Georgia."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2010/oct/18/nathan-deal/barnes-mexico-trip-sparks-new-round-attacks/	Editor's note: A response to the Oct. 1 U.S. Senate PolitiFact article can be found in Letters to the Editor With the economy and the impact of illegal immigration on the job market on the minds of many voters this political season, Republican nominee for governor Nathan Deal recently attempted to remind Georgians that he -- not Democrat Roy Barnes -- is on their side concerning these issues. The Deal campaign put together a 30-second ad that begins with Barnes discussing his goal of creating more jobs. "We need to take care of our own," Barnes says. "Hmm," a male voice says. "Sounds nice. But Roy Barnes proclaimed Mexican workers good for Georgia." Deal's proof is an Atlanta Journal-Constitution article from Nov. 8, 2001. The story detailed a meeting between Barnes, who was governor at the time, and then Mexican President Vicente Fox in Mexico City. Barnes is reported as saying that Georgia's experience with a fast-growing immigrant population has generally been beneficial. "The labor we have received, primarily Mexicans, has fueled our economy," Barnes said. He added: "We could not have had the Olympics in 1996 had it not been for that." The Barnes campaign called the Deal ad a distortion of Barnes' position on immigrants legally working in the United States. "Barnes praised 'immigration,' not illegal immigration, as having been 'beneficial' as it 'fueled our economy,' " the Barnes campaign said in a statement. "He urged President Bush to 'work [immigration] out' because 'governors can't control immigration policy.' " Deal campaign spokesman Brian Robinson countered that it is disingenuous for the Barnes campaign to accuse Deal's ad of stretching the truth here. Barnes was certainly aware that most immigrant workers were not here legally, Robinson said. "For him to imply otherwise doesn't pass the laugh test," Robinson said. "What percentage of that work force meets that criteria [of being in the U.S. legally]?" We took a look. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security estimated that in 2009, there were slightly more than 28,000 people in Georgia who were legal permanent residents or "green card" holders. The federal agency also tries to keep track of how many people are living illegally in the U.S. About 480,000 illegal immigrants were living in Georgia in 2009, according to Homeland Security estimates, and in 2000 the estimated total was 220,000. The Homeland Security report does not have a breakdown of what percentage of people living in Georgia illegally are from Mexico. Nationwide, Homeland Security estimates that 62 percent of illegal immigrants in the U.S. are from Mexico. Applied to Georgia in 2000, that would be 136,400 illegal immigrants from Mexico. Presumably a large number of those were workers. Barnes was in Mexico in 2001 for a four-day trade mission. Mexico was Georgia's third-largest trading partner, and Georgia companies were exporting $1 billion in products to that nation. State officials estimated at the time that Latino-owned businesses in Georgia had about $1.3 billion a year in annual sales. Some of Georgia's business titans, such as Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines, came on the trip. Barnes told a story in the 2001 AJC article about farmers in South Georgia, where he said "it's about as conservative as you can get," who wanted him to get health coverage for "migrant farmworkers." The governor noted the presidents of the United States and Mexico were discussing proposals for legalizing some undocumented Mexican workers. "Old ideas have changed," Barnes said. But since then attitudes toward illegal immigration have hardened, as highlighted by a poll that found 68 percent of Georgians support Arizona-type restrictions and enforcement of illegal immigration laws. And many politicians do not want to appear soft on the issue. Barnes said during a July debate that he would support an Arizona-type law in the Peach State to fight illegal immigration. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer signed a law that has since gone before the courts that allows state and local law enforcement officers to ask people stopped for possible crimes to show proof they are in the United States legally. Deal's first television ad, in July, slammed President Barack Obama over illegal immigration, promised Georgia would soon have an Arizona-type law and said he doesn't care what "liberals" think. Robinson accused Barnes of running from his "liberal record" with his support of the Arizona legislation. "He is all over the board on this," Robinson said. Andra Gillespie, an assistant political science professor at Emory University, explained that Barnes is trying to cut into Deal's conservative base by taking a stand on illegal immigration that is seemingly popular with most Georgia voters. Gillespie said the Deal statement that Barnes "proclaimed Mexican workers good for Georgia" is misleading. "Nathan Deal's campaign knows very well that when Roy Barnes went to Mexico and praised the contributions of Mexican immigrants [presumably in a spirit of good will and diplomacy], he was not explicitly supporting illegal immigration," the professor said. "But because Barnes did not specify his support for legal immigrant workers, the Deal campaign is taking advantage of the ambiguity and trying to fill in the blanks for voters." We believe the Deal ad does accurately convey the quotes from Barnes in the 2001 AJC article. However, it's unclear that Barnes was talking specifically about illegal immigrants and, moreover, Barnes uttered the quotes nine years ago in a different political and economic climate. It doesn't necessarily follow that Barnes supports Mexican labor in Georgia today. So the ad lacks context that might give viewers a different impression. So by the definition of our Truth-o-Meter, the statement rates as Half True.	None	Nathan Deal	None	None	None	2010-10-18T06:00:00	2010-10-12	['Mexico']
pomt-12372	Says Arabic "is the third most-common language in Austin."	false	/texas/statements/2017/jun/05/maram-museitif/city-austin-appointee-says-arabic-third-most-commo/	An Austin appointee declared Arabic the Texas capital’s third most-common language. De veras? Maram Museitif, confirmed by the Austin City Council in May 2017 to serve until 2020 on the Central Health Board of Managers, was quoted saying in a press release announcing the appointment: "I'm very familiar with Central Health's mission and the needs of the people we serve. I bring a broader representation to the board." Museitif went on: "Austin has a growing Muslim, Arab, and refugee community and they need a voice at the table. I can be that voice. I'm a Muslim and speak fluent Arabic, which is the third most-common language in Austin." That’s not so for all of Austin, we found, but it has been so among patients seeking care at clinics overseen by Central Health. For all of Texas, we previously found True a 2016 claim by Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, that Vietnamese is the state’s third most-spoken language. Cornyn’s statement was backed up by U.S. Census Bureau survey results. Those results placed Arabic about No. 10 in the state. Spokesman: Appointee meant to limit claim Ted Burton, a Central Health spokesman, responded to our request for the basis of Museitif’s statement by saying she meant to say something less. "Museitif," Burton wrote, "was referring to CommUnityCare’s patient population – meaning patients in our community that Central Health serves." He said the online press release quoting Museitif would be amended to quote her calling Arabic "the third most common language in the CommUnityCare patient population." Central Health says it works through a network of health care partners and community members to connect uninsured, underinsured and low-income residents with high-quality, cost-effective health care. Its all-volunteer board consists of four members appointed by the council, four by the Travis County Commissioners Court — plus one joint appointee Burton wrote that in fiscal 2015, a little over half of the entity’s patients spoke English, nearly 44 percent spoke Spanish--and, third in concentration, 1.1 percent reported speaking Arabic, according to self-reported patient data. In the year, Burton said, about 20 clinics served more than 88,000 patients. Burton provided a chart breaking out patients’ "language" responses: Top 10 Languages spoken by CUC patients, FY15 (excluding unknown or other) Language % 1 English 51.9% 2 Spanish 43.5% 3 Arabic 1.1% 4 Burmese 0.4% 5 Nepali 0.4% 6 Vietnamese 0.3% 7 Persian 0.2% 8 American Sign Language 0.2% 9 Swahili 0.1% 10 Amharic 0.1% Total 98.1% SOURCE: Email citing patient-submitted responses, Ted Burton, director of communications, Central Health, May 26, 2017 Burton, asked for more detail, emailed us a document showing that Arabic also proved to be CommUnityCare patients’ third most-common language in 2014 and 2016. Asked why Arabic has been so widely used among patients, Burton put us in touch with an Arabic-speaking CommUnityCare physician assistant, Amneh Amro, who speculated by phone that there’d been an Austin-area uptick in refugees from Arabic-speaking countries including Syria. A decade earlier, Amro said, Asian languages were likely more prevalent among patients. When we asked, Burton said Central Health has no data on patients' countries of origin. Surveys: Chinese third most-common Austin language So, which languages are most prevalent in Austin? We heard back from a couple of authorities on that. Jewel Jordan, a Census Bureau spokeswoman, pointed out results from the single-year 2015 American Community Survey indicating that behind English and Spanish, the third most common spoken language in Austin was Chinese. According to those survey results, Arabic was Austin’s 12th most-common spoken language — though we noticed that if you apply the survey’s margin of error figures as much as possible to drive up the number of Austin Arabic speakers and apply respective margins of error to drive down the number of speakers of some other languages, it’s possible to place Arabic fifth in the city, behind English, Spanish, Chinese and "Other Asian Languages." Ryan Robinson, the City of Austin demographer, drew on the bureau’s five-year ACS results through 2015 to provide a chart showing Arabic 10th in prevalence among spoken languages in Austin behind English, Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, other Asian languages, Korean, Hindi, French and other Indic languages. The chart also presents estimates of the number of individuals primarily speaking about 30 other languages. Our ruling Museitif called Arabic Austin’s third most-common language. That’s incorrect; in 2015, Chinese ranked third in prevalence in Austin behind English and Spanish, according to federal surveys. Arabic was evidently third most common among languages spoken by patients at clinics overseen by Central Health. We rate Museitif’s statement False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-09558	"The State of Texas does not even use the E-Verify system to determine if someone is legally in our country when they apply for a job."	true	/texas/statements/2010/feb/01/kay-bailey-hutchison/hutchison-says-texas-state-doesnt-use-e-verify-wee/	U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Republican candidate for governor, is one of nearly 183,500 employers nationwide who have registered to use E-Verify. The federal electronic system is designed to prevent the hiring of illegal workers by letting employers run a prospective employee's name, date and Social Security number through government records. During the Jan. 14 GOP gubernatorial debate, she criticized the state for not using the online system to check its job applicants. "The State of Texas does not even use the E-Verify system to determine if someone is legally in our country when they apply for a job," she said. "If I'm governor of Texas, we will." During the second debate Friday, Hutchison called E-Verify the best system for employers to identify undocumented workers. Is Texas state government really not using the verification service singled out by Hutchison? If not, does that mean it isn't checking whether job applicants are legally living here? During Friday's debate, Gov. Rick Perry said: "E-Verify would not make a hill of beans' difference when it comes to what's happening in America today. You secure the border first, then you can talk about how to identify individuals in an immigration situation." Still, the state does screen prospective employees. Allison Castle, Perry's press secretary, said: "We use I-9 forms in compliance with federal law." She was referring to the Employment Eligibilty I-9 form from the Department of Homeland Security which must be filled out by the employer and new employees to document that each employee — citizen and non-citizen alike — is authorized to work in the United States. Employers, who are required to keep filled-out forms on file for three years, are subject to penalties if they can't produce them upon request from federal agencies. Tyler Moran, policy director for the National Immigration Law center, which advocates for low-income immigrants, said the I-9 form, if completed in good faith, is an effective means of weeding out undocumented workers. Authorities say that by completing the form, employers demonstrate that they have examined relevant documents (such as a Social Security card) to check their workers' identities. That's how the State of Texas has certified new hires' legal residency since 1986, when a federal law prohibited employers from knowingly hiring residents who are not legally living in the United States. In 2007, Texas enacted legislation that further requires businesses that are applying for a grant or tax cut from a public agency to submit a statement certifying that they don't knowingly employ undocumented residents. But no law requires employers to verify the authenticity of their workers' documents. Undoubtedly, some undocumented immigrants use fake or stolen Social Security numbers to apply for jobs. The E-Verify system, which uses information from the I-9 form, was developed by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to prevent such fraud. About 183,500 entities use the program, including 9,700 of the roughly 380,600 private Texas employers including AT&T and the Houston Ballet. Except for an estimated 170,000 federal contractors, E-verify is still voluntary for an estimated 6 million employers. Since its inception in 2006, E-Verify has been used by Hutchison's office to screen 363 job applicants to her Washington and Texas offices, according to DHS spokeswoman Maria Elena Garcia Upson. But E-Verify isn't foolproof. It has incorrectly identified legal residents as undocumented workers and vice versa. According to the the Department of Homeland Security, which operates E-Verify with the Social Security Administration, 0.3 percent of workers — from the millions of queries employers have filed — have successfully contested instances when their documents didn't match E-Verify records. In 2002, Westat, a Washington research organization, evaluated E-Verify's pilot program at the request of the federal government. The group found that there were "serious problems with the timeliness and accuracy of the INS (Immigration and Naturalization Service) database." In March 2009, the Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan agency that provides analysis to Congress, found that while the program had improved, it was still flawed: "While... E-Verify can detect certain types of document fraud, it has limited ability to detect such fraud when the 'counterfeit documents are of reasonable quality and contain information about actual work-authorized persons.' Valid documents obtained by using fraudulent birth certificates or other so-called breeder documents may be even more difficult for E-Verify to detect." About a month later, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano (who'd earlier signed legislation making E-Verify mandatory in Arizona, where she was governor) touted the program as the best way to verify the legal residency of state government workers, "adjunct to enforcement of our immigration laws." Ten states require their state agencies to participate in E-Verify; three more — South Carolina, Arizona and Mississippi — require all employers to use it, too. In 2008, though, Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour aired these misgivings: "I am concerned about mandating the E-Verify system as the sole source from which an employer in Mississippi can verify a potential employee’s eligibility, especially since the federal government itself has said E-Verify is not a reliable system." The bottom line: Texas uses the same method of checking legal residency that most states use. But Hutchison correctly said the state doesn't use E-Verify. We find her statement True.

pomt-00202	Dan McCready "did admit he opposes middle class tax cuts."	false	/north-carolina/statements/2018/oct/17/congressional-leadership-fund/attack-ad-distorts-mccreadys-position-tax-cuts/	There are few voting blocs as coveted as the proverbial middle class. Politicians often boast about how their economic strategies are good for the middle class. Or they’ll say their opponent’s tax plans are bad for the middle class. A new ad by the Congressional Leadership Fund goes a step further while making a claim about Dan McCready, the Democrat facing Republican Mark Harris in North Carolina’s 9th Congressional District. The ad, citing a recent Charlotte Observer editorial, criticizes McCready for dodging questions in a recent forum. The narrator then pivots. "But McCready did admit he opposes middle class tax cuts," the narrator says. As the narrator speaks, the ad displays an image of a story about McCready that McClatchy newspapers published on June 5. Does the article back up the claim that McCready said he opposes tax cuts for the middle class? Not really. McCready was referring to his overall opposition to the tax plan. In fact, McCready says in the story he opposes the tax plan because it didn’t do enough to help the middle class. "It took steps in the right direction, particularly in making American business more competitive," but "did not cut taxes enough for the middle class," McCready is quoted as saying. The Trump tax cuts Contacted by PolitiFact, a spokesman for the Congressional Leadership Fund (CLF) noted that McCready opposed the tax plan approved by Republicans last year. Thus, the spokesman posited, McCready opposed tax cuts for the middle class. PolitiFact has written extensively about the tax plan, noting that most Americans will see cuts in the next few years. According to the Tax Policy Center, a project of the Urban Institute and Brookings, 90 percent of middle-income households would pay less in 2018. However, those savings largely disappear by 2027, except for the top 1 percent of earners. The CLF claim is similar to one made recently by Sen. Dean Heller, a Republican from Nevada. He claimed his opponent, Democrat Jacky Rosen, promised to "repeal (the) middle-class tax cut." Political groups like to paint opponents with a broad brush. Just because a candidate doesn’t support a bill doesn’t mean they oppose everything the bill does. McCready’s position McCready has repeatedly said he supports tax cuts for the middle class. He hopes to re-tool the Trump tax plan rather than repeal it, said Aaron Simpson, McCready’s deputy campaign manager. "The first thing Dan would have done differently is make sure the tax cuts to the middle class is permanent. In addition, he believes we should have focused more on small business tax relief and making it easier to raise a family," Simpson said in an email to PolitiFact. McCready stated that position on his Facebook page in December and in a debate with Harris on Oct. 10. He said he supports the tax cuts in the Trump tax bill. "But we needed to do much more of that: Give less of the tax cuts to the Warren Buffetts and Koch Brothers of the world and more to the hardworking teachers and firefighters that deserve a lot better here in North Carolina," McCready said. Our ruling The Congressional Leadership Fund ad says McCready admitted he opposes middle class tax cuts. They cited a story about the tax plan passed last year. In it, McCready specifically says the tax plan didn’t do enough to help the middle class. And McCready has repeatedly said he likes the middle class tax cuts in the Trump plan. We rate this claim False. This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters’ Lab and PolitiFact. The NC Local News Lab Fund and the International Center for Journalists provide support for the project, which shares fact-checks with newsrooms statewide.

pomt-03483	Says Madison Mayor Paul Soglin's stated intent when proposing that city contractors disclose private political donations was to "discourage contributions to organizations with which he disagrees."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jun/12/wisconsin-institute-law-liberty/wisconsin-institute-law-liberty-says-law-aims-disc/	Madison Mayor Paul Soglin wants to require city contractors to publicly disclose donations they’ve made to super PACS or advocacy groups operating in Wisconsin. That has drawn objections from a conservative public interest law firm, the Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty. It contends the liberal mayor’s proposed ordinance is unconstitutional and violates "a bedrock principle of our democracy that government cannot play favorites among citizens, including public contractors, based on their political beliefs." So why does Soglin want to mandate the public disclosures by firms doing business with the city? Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty offered this answer in a June 4, 2012 post on its website: The proposed ordinance, "according to Mayor Soglin, is intended to discourage contributions to organizations with which he disagrees." Is that what Soglin has said is a goal of the legislation? Asked to back up the group’s claim, Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty president and general counsel Rick Esenberg pointed to a May 8, 2013 story in Madison’s Capital Times that quoted Soglin extensively about his motives. The article stated that actions by Republican Gov. Scott Walker and the GOP-controlled Legislature that ran contrary to the wishes of Madison and Soglin were on the mayor’s mind when he drafted the ordinance. "Legislative action since Gov. Scott Walker’s election — including Act 10 in 2011 curtailing the collective bargaining power of most public workers, and more recently, legislation setting levy limits for municipalities and restricting cities’ powers in tenant-landlord law — got Soglin wondering if companies supporting Republican causes would rather lobby against the city or do business with it," the Cap Times story said. It added: "He’s betting that exposing such activities might prompt some companies to curtail them." Those passages suggest pretty strongly that Soglin believes that some contractors faced with being identified as pro-Republican or pro-conservative will reconsider their political activity under his proposal to require them to publicly report their now-private donations to advocacy groups. Deeper into the Capital Times interview, Soglin made another reference to the right side of the political spectrum. He mentioned the Koch Brothers, the billionaire industrialists who founded the conservative group Americans for Prosperity, a tea-party organization that supported Walker in his 2012 recall win. It’s unclear how much the group raises and spends because as a tax-exempt organization the group, like many others, does not have to disclose its donors. Soglin’s additional comments from the article: "I think it would be a good idea to know if the bidders are contributing to political efforts which go into organizations that may be lobbying for certain kinds of outcomes or working against the interests of the city. It is simply the idea that sunshine is good." "If a company bidding on a city contract also is lobbying for state or federal regulations that make their product required in their industry, the public ought to know about it. At the same time if they’re supplying the city while they're behaving like the Koch brothers, it would be good for the public to know it." "It’s a bit ironic when someone wants a contract with government, yet supports organizations that hate government and try to make it inefficient." So that is what is in the article. To be sure, the language of the proposed ordinance itself doesn’t say Soglin’s intent is to squelch donations. It says information on donations is "essential to the operation of a democracy, informing voters and governments about the activities of those attempting to influence the operations of government." Indeed, the proposal would require disclosure of donations to groups of any political stripe -- it does not single out conservatives or Republicans. Rather, the ordinance specifies that firms and minority owners disclose donations made to tax-exempt 501(c)(4) advocacy or "super PAC" organizations operating in Wisconsin the prior two years. Contractors would face a one-year ban from receiving city contracts if they fail to disclose any donations to advocacy groups within 30 days of getting a contract. When we reached Soglin, he acknowledged the ordinance might cause some firms hoping to continue as city contractors to stop making donations to groups that oppose the views of he and other city leaders. "I will not say that this will leave things exactly the way things are," he said. But Soglin added this: He said the contractors were free to exercise their First Amendment rights and that he hopes they continue to make such donations, saying, "I want to know where they stand." He said his goal was to unmask donations, for example, by firms whose ownersmake private donations to advocacy groups working to unseat sitting aldermen. Or to identify firm officials who give to groups supporting private-school vouchers and other programs and decisions he and city officials have opposed. "I think the public has a right to know," said Soglin. What would happen if left-leaning city officials discover that contractors are fighting the views of city officials in private? Soglin said no city officials will take into account political donations when officials are deciding on awarding a contract. That language is also included in the ordinance. But Scott Resnick, the Madison Common Council’s president pro tem, told us in an interview that aldermen would, in fact, use the information on donations made to groups supporting Republicans in state government when evaluating whether firms should be rewarded future city contracts. "So we want to know if you were putting money towards that before we sign another contract with you," he said. "This would be one more data set that will be used to make decisions" on awarding contracts. In the view of Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty’s Esenberg, the ordinance’s statement that political activity would not be held against firms at contract time shows the provision has no legitimate government purpose. "Curiosity is not a valid governmental purpose, nor is the exposure of private contributions to the public for use by you or others in the political arena," Esenberg wrote to Soglin on June 3, 2013. Soglin, Esenberg said, leaves the listener no other choice but to think that he favors an outcome in which contractors curtail their political activity. "He wants to out these people as conservatives or libertarians, and they won’t want to be outed that way in Madison," Esenberg said. Our rating The Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty contended that, according to Soglin himself, the proposed ordinance "is intended to discourage contributions to organizations with which he disagrees." The group cites a newspaper interview that paraphrased Soglin saying that could happen in some cases as a result of his legislation. Soglin told us the same thing, but said his goal was limited to transparency. His statements make pretty clear he looks forward to forcing contractors to choose between trimming their political activity or disclosing it and facing the consequences. And he predicts some will stop making donations. We rate the statement True.	None	Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty	None	None	None	2013-06-12T09:00:00	2013-06-04	['None']
pomt-08042	"We're worse than a Third World country in terms of water quality and the way we treat our sewage."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2011/jan/04/mike-polensek/cleveland-councilman-mike-polensek-rails-sewage-tr/	Industrial pollution made national news and made Cleveland the butt of jokes in 1969 after the Cuyahoga River caught fire -- not for the first time -- and did $50,000 damage to bridges. The fire helped focus attention on environmental problems and contributed to passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972. Water pollution from sanitary sewer and storm runoff has had a lower profile. But the issue has been important to Cleveland City Councilman Mike Polensek "for more years than I care to recall," he says. There are almost two miles of lakefront in his ward and a good portion of that is public beach. Polensek spoke at a meeting of the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District in November to support its $3 billion settlement with EPA that could triple sewer rates in Cleveland and about 60 suburbs, but will pay for mandated construction work to deal with combined sanitary and storm sewer overflows. "Let's face it, this is the year 2010 and we're worse than a Third World country in terms of water quality and the way we treat our sewage," Polensek told sewer district trustees. "What we're paying for now is really an indictment of the 40-year delay in living up to the Clean Water Act." PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look to see if there is any truth to his comparison. Polensek is notably outspoken, and "Third World" sounded like dramatic hyperbole. But the councilman told PolitiFact Ohio he was not exaggerating and would not water down his remarks. "It's outrageous in America in 2010 that we have tributaries as polluted as the Tigris and Euphrates," he said. "It's unconscionable when you see the filth that comes down that creek after a rainstorm. We have the technology to prevent it. What we haven't got is elected officials with the (guts) to make the tough decisions. They have deferred and deferred and passed the proverbial bleeping buck. You pay now or pay later." Two side-by-side beaches, Euclid Beach and Villa Angela, are a particular concern. Both are close to Euclid Creek, which drains a 24-square-mile section of eastern Cuyahoga County into Lake Erie. Both beaches were too unhealthy for swimming on 48 percent of the days last summer, according to the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District. From May 2 to Sept. 6, average bacterial levels sampled daily exceeded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's maximum E. coli standard by 40 percent. (The standard is a density of 235 parts per 100 ml of water, indicating the presence of human or animal waste that could make swimmers sick.) "It should be a national embarrassment," Polensek said. "It's a sin that we have those types of bacterial levels." He sees improving Great Lakes water quality as an economic development issue and a strategic defense issue, because "We don't have to worry about trying to get water across a border." He is angriest about health issues. "Where do they think our drinking water comes from?" he asked, noting he's had complaints about respiratory, eye and ear infections blamed on contact with lake water. Women have reported vaginal infections, he said. PolitiFact Ohio found support for Polensek's anger. The National Resources Defense Council found Cleveland the worst urban area on the Great Lakes in bacterial samples, with the highest risk of gastrointestinal illness on Great Lakes beaches. East Side beaches get 55 percent of the nearly 5 billion gallons of raw sewage dumped into the lake in Greater Cleveland per year. Euclid Creek is the most polluted tributary in the region. But is it Third World? "Third World" once designated countries not aligned politically with the West or the East. Now it generally refers to underdeveloped and developing countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America, but it has no single definition. "There is no established convention for the designation of 'developed' and 'developing' countries or areas in the United Nations system," says the UN Statistics Division. "An estimated 90 percent of all wastewater in developing countries is discharged untreated directly into rivers, lakes or the oceans," according to the United Nations Environment Programme, but we could find no benchmark characterizing recreational or bathing water of developing nations or "Third World" quality. We turned for perspective to an expert not involved in local politics or government: scientist Sandra L. McLellan of the Great Lakes Water Institute at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Her specialty is environmental toxicology, and her laboratory's major focus is investigating connections between environmental processes and human health. Her current projects involve sewage pollution in rivers and at beaches. She did not dispute Polensek, though she preferred more careful wording. "I think the accurate statement would be that during the time of a combined sewage overflow we're no better than a developing country," she said. She found it particularly startling and significant that the regional sewer district reports more than 80 sewage overflows in a typical season on just the East Side beaches near Euclid Creek. "It's a pretty bad situation and not up to what other cities have done," McLellan said. "That's like the 1970s or '80s for most cities. They should have only two or three (overflows) a year." In Milwaukee, she said, construction in 1993 of a deep tunnel system reduced overflows from 50-60 per year to 2.5. That's also the specific goal of the Euclid Creek Tunnel, the first part of the sewer district's Project Clean Lake, on which construction will begin in March. The bottom line, she said, is what happens during overflows: "It's a completely open sewer going directly to the rivers and streams. It is like Third World." So where does that leave Polensek’s statement? While the region does not meet the discharge levels estimated for developing countries -- that 90 percent of all wastewater is discharged untreated directly into rivers, lakes or the oceans -- it is clear that pollution levels are high. Bacterial counts at two beaches in Polensek’s ward exceeded save levels for nearly half the days during the summer and Cleveland’s beaches were rated worst among urban centers in the Great Lakes. And an expert on environmental toxicology agrees that when there are overflows from the sewage system -- something that impacts those beaches an average of more than 80 times a season -- it would be like "Third World," with an open sewer flowing directly into rivers and streams So we find Polensek’s statement has some elements of truth, but that also you need to know some important details to completely evaluate its accuracy. On the Truth-O-Meter that scores a rating of Half True.	None	Mike Polensek	None	None	None	2011-01-04T06:00:00	2010-11-18	['None']
pomt-00619	"Florida was the only state during my eight years to go from AA to AAA" in its bond rating.	false	/florida/statements/2015/may/28/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-florida-was-only-state-get-aaa-bond-/	Not-quite-yet Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush continues to sell potential voters on his eight years as Florida’s governor. "Florida was the only state during my eight years to go from AA to AAA (in its bond rating)," Bush told business leaders in Portsmouth, N.H., on May 20, 2015. He added the change followed years of increasing the state’s cash reserves from $1 billion to $10 billion. A state getting its bond rating upgraded is a relatively rare occurrence, so we wondered whether Florida was the only state to jump to a top rating while Bush was in office from 1999-2006. Getting an upgrade For this analysis, we’re focusing on the state’s general obligation bond rating -- that is, an expert analysis of a state’s ability to pay its debts. This rating, which is kind of like a person’s credit score, is formulated by three major rating agencies: Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings. Each reports their ratings differently, but Bush’s Right to Rise political action committee spokesman Matt Gorman told us he was referring specifically to the S&P analysis. Gorman shared a Pew Charitable Trusts infographic that showed "S&P state credit ratings" from 2001 to 2014. The infographic shows that Florida was the only state between 2001 and 2006 to make the ratings leap Bush specified (AA to AAA). On Feb. 25, 2005, S&P upgraded Florida’s general obligation bond rating from AA+ (which is slightly higher than their AA rating, actually) to AAA. The difference is in rating the state’s capacity to meet its debt obligations from "very strong" to "extremely strong," according to agency guidelines. For the record, Moody’s and Fitch also upgraded the state that year, but their ratings are designated differently. S&P’s report on the upgrade said the decision was "based on the state's strong and conservative financial and budget management practices, coupled with substantial budget reserves and economic trends that have been among the strongest nationally." The report also cited stable state revenue, a moderate debt burden and a service-based economy that was growing faster than the national average as among other reasons for the upgrade. S&P’s analysis said Florida’s outlook was stable due to "the state's strong budget reserves and demonstrated track record of active budget management and long-term planning and forecasting." Bush wants to take credit for this budget management, and he could lay some claim to the idea. He was well-known during his tenure for regularly using the line-item veto to discard hundreds of millions in spending on budgeted projects Bush deemed wasteful or that didn’t follow his agenda. Taking the red pen to the Legislature’s final budgets helped build the state’s cash reserves from $1.3 billion to $9.8 billion by 2006, so Bush’s numbers there are pretty accurate. The Legislature actively socked cash away in state coffers during this time. So, yes, Florida was the only state to make the jump looking at data between 2001 and 2014. But there’s one problem: Bush became governor in 1999. Those two years make a big difference. We asked S&P for its history of state ratings and found two instances that counter Bush’s claim: On Feb. 22, 2000, S&P upgraded Delaware from AA+ to AAA. On Sept. 27, 2000, the agency did the same for Michigan. (It was downgraded back to AA+ in 2003.) Florida, for the record, still enjoys the AAA rating it earned in 2005, with an outlook S&P now considers stable. Our ruling Bush said, "Florida was the only state during my eight years to go from AA to AAA (in its bond rating)." Florida’s general obligation bond rating was upgraded by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services in 2005. But both Delaware and Michigan were upgraded from AA+ to AAA by the S&P in 2000, which was during Bush’s second year in office. The information Bush’s PAC cited did not include his first two years in office. We rate his statement False.	None	Jeb Bush	None	None	None	2015-05-28T10:00:00	2015-05-20	['None']
pomt-04784	Says Betty Sutton and House Democrats "gutted" Medicare by $741 billion to pay for Obamacare.	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2012/aug/24/jim-renacci/jim-renacci-says-betty-sutton-democrats-gutted-med/	Mitt Romney rekindled a heated debate over Medicare by picking U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan as his running mate. Ryan, head of the Budget Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives, is the architect of a plan to dramatically restructure Medicare, which today operates as a government-run health insurance plan for Americans over age 65. Democratic congressional candidates are making the protection of traditional Medicare a centerpiece of their campaigns. The Republican response has been to attack back. In a series of news releases dealing with the national health care reform law, the National Republican Congressional Committee on Aug. 14 claimed 37 House Democrats are "gutting $741 billion from Medicare" to pay for the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. One of those 37 Democrats was Rep. Betty Sutton. GOP Rep. Jim Renacci, her opponent in Ohio's newly redrawn 16th congressional district, repeated the claim the next day in a campaign fundraising email. "We all know that our seniors were slapped with an estimated $500 billion blow to Medicare in 2010 when President Obama and Betty Sutton pushed through their healthcare law, which ended Medicare as we know it," the message said. "Now, revised estimates by the Congressional Budget Office reveal Democrats gutted even more from Medicare than we first knew, taking $741 billion from seniors to fund ObamaCare." PolitiFact Ohio was interested. We have examined the claim that health care reform cuts Medicare by $500 billion on a number of occasions. The most recent was last May, when Renacci's campaign website said Sutton "gutted Medicare by $500 billion" to fund Obamacare. We rated that statement Mostly False. How did the claim climb from $500 billion to $741 billion? Renacci's email said: "Revised estimates by the Congressional Budget Office reveal Democrats gutted even more from Medicare than we first knew, taking $741 billion from seniors to fund Obamacare." We asked Renacci's campaign how he backs up the statement. Except for the revised estimate from the Congressional Budget Office, the backup matched the sourcing for the earlier claim with $500 billion. Let's review, with the revised estimate. First, Obamacare does not literally cut a dollar amount from the Medicare program’s budget. Rather, spending will grow. But the health care law instituted a number of changes to slow the program’s future spending growth and try to contain future health care costs in the program. At the time the law was passed, those savings amounted to $500 billion over the next 10 years. At the time the health care law was being finalized and passed, Democrats said it was important to them that the new law not add to the deficit. So savings in Medicare spending were counted against the health care law’s new spending. That spending is primarily to cover the uninsured, by giving them tax credits to buy private insurance. But some new spending increases Medicare coverage for prescription drugs for seniors. The efforts to limit future growth were mainly aimed at insurance companies and hospitals, not beneficiaries. The law makes significant changes to Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. Medicare Advantage was started under President George W. Bush, and the idea was that competition among the private insurers would reduce costs. But in recent years the plans have actually cost more than traditional Medicare. So the health care law scales back the payments to private insurers. Hospitals, too, will be paid less if they have too many re-admissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care. Obama and fellow Democrats say the intention is to protect beneficiaries' coverage while forcing health care providers to become more efficient. Under the new law, the overall Medicare budget is projected to go up for the foreseeable future. The health care law tries to limit that growth, making it less than it would have been without the law, but not reducing its overall budget. Because Medicare spending gets bigger every year, the figure for the savings also increases. Also, it takes a few years for the health care law’s savings mechanisms to kick in. In fact, the effects of time are the main reason the $500 billion number has risen past $700 billion. The CBO determined in 2011 that the federal health care law would reduce Medicare outlays by $507 billion between 2012 and 2021. In its latest estimate released last month, the budget office looked at the years 2013 to 2022 and determined the health care law would reduce future Medicare spending by $716 billion. The $741 billion cited by the RNCC and Renacci includes that Medicare spending and money for other federal programs. So it is timing that's making the figures bigger, not changes to Medicare. The claim that Democrats support "gutting" Medicare is wrong -- program spending will still increase under Obamacare, but at a slower pace. There is an element of truth in Renacci’s claim. The health care law seeks to reduce future Medicare spending, and the tally of those cost reductions over the next 10 years is $716 billion. But describing those savings as cuts that gut Medicare suggests a slashing of programs that is not in the law. On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates Mostly False.

pomt-10334	McCain has switched to Obama's position on more troops to Afghanistan.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/22/barack-obama/ground-conditions-have-changed-too/	Sen. John McCain has praised the surge in Iraq for bringing greater stability to the region, and has reminded voters that he long supported it. But while Iraq was stabilizing, the situation in Afghanistan was deteriorating. So on July 15, 2008, the McCain campaign released "a new comprehensive strategy for victory in Afghanistan" that applies "the tried and true principles of counterinsurgency used in the Iraq surge." His new policy includes sending at least three additional brigades to Afghanistan. "Our commanders on the ground say they need these troops, and thanks to the success of the surge, these forces are becoming available," states the campaign's strategy outline. Sen. Barack Obama's campaign pounced on this news. By the end of the week, spokesman Bill Burton had sent out a memo titled, "Obama leading on foreign policy, McCain following." "This past week, Senator McCain changed his position for political reasons, embracing Obama's call for more troops the day after Obama restated it in a New York Times op-ed, and almost one year after Obama's initial plan," Burton wrote. We reviewed the candidates' past statements to determine whether McCain has changed position to match Obama. Back on Aug. 1, 2007, Obama gave a major foreign policy speech at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, D.C. The speech got a lot of attention because Obama said that the United States should aggressively pursue terrorists hiding in the mountains of Pakistan. "If we have actionable intelligence about high-value terrorist targets and President Musharraf won't act, we will," Obama said. (See our previous Truth-O-Meter rulings here , here and here. ) But Obama also talked about the need for the United States to turn its attention to Afghanistan. "Our troops have fought valiantly there, but Iraq has deprived them of the support they need — and deserve," Obama said. "As a result, parts of Afghanistan are falling into the hands of the Taliban, and a mix of terrorism, drugs and corruption threatens to overwhelm the country. As president, I would deploy at least two additional brigades to Afghanistan to re-enforce our counterterrorism operations and support NATO's efforts against the Taliban." In the months that followed, Obama repeatedly emphasized his assertion that the United States "had taken our eye off the ball" by invading Iraq instead of concentrating on Afghanistan. McCain, meanwhile, has rebutted Obama by saying that Iraq is and should be the central front on the war on terror. We couldn't find examples of McCain specifically rejecting Obama's proposal to send more troops to Afghanistan. Neither could we find examples of him supporting more brigades in Afghanistan, which likely would raise logistical questions about whether there were enough troops for a surge in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Rather, when it came to Afghanistan, McCain emphasized the need for NATO countries to do their part, and for the United States and NATO forces to better manage troop levels and logistics. As recently as July 8, 2008, McCain emphasized these points. During an interview with the Pittsburgh Tribune Review, McCain talked at length about NATO, saying only that it was possible the United States might have to add more troops, but not specifically endorsing that position. Here's the exchange: Question: "Senator, you had called the situation in Afghanistan tough and you said that any failure there could lead — could have dire consequences for the NATO alliance. Beyond Pakistan, what do you think it takes for the U.S. to succeed there? Is more troops the answer?" McCain: "I think there is a whole lot of challenges that we face. One of them is whether we succeed or not in Iraq. I think that has a direct impact on the region. But I also believe that the Karzai government being more effective, the Pakistan situation as you and I discussed, the economic progress, again this is one of these situations where you've got to maintain the security environment, but then you've got to have the progress where people will have a better life to look forward to. And one of the failures, because of corruption, has been that we haven't made the progress economically in some of these parts of Iraq and we had this window of opportunity and it wasn't as well used as perhaps it could have. But again, I can't tell you that there's one solution to it with the struggle military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, it's all of one and yet it has various aspects. And I just finally would say, and I'm sorry for some wrong answers, but we are in this with other nations. That's important. And I'm glad that Sarkozy is sending additional French troops over there. I'm glad that many of our allies, I wish more of them and I wish the rules of engagement for some of them were better and a lot of things. But the fact is this is a — this is a lot of nations that are in this in a common interest." Question: "Do you think more troops should — do you think — some of the military have called for more additional troops ..." McCain: "I think yes, and I'd love to see our allies to contribute more in a broad variety of ways. I'd love to see that. And we may have to send additional troops. As you know, they just extended the Marine unit there by an additional 30 days. And I think they had — they did that very reluctantly." A week later, McCain would specifically advocate sending three more brigades to Afghanistan. One point McCain has made again and again on the campaign trail is that, when it comes to foreign policy, he bases his opinions on "conditions on the ground." His new policy on Afghanistan can fairly be interpreted as a reaction to those conditions, which have demonstrably worsened in the weeks before his announcement. The Obama campaign has said that McCain has changed position on Afghanistan for political reasons, to follow Obama. We are not ruling on McCain's motivation here; the McCain campaign can just as easily argue that McCain has changed position because circumstances have changed. From a political standpoint, it's certainly inconvenient when "conditions on the ground" dictate you dropping your position for your opponent's. Be all that as it may, Obama advocated more troops for Afghanistan about a year ago. McCain only recently embraced the same position. We rule this claim is True.

pomt-09740	The Baucus health care bill "would drastically restrict the use of flexible spending accounts (FSAs) in order to help pay for health care reform."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/15/save-flexible-spending-plans/flexible-spending-accounts-under-health-care-refor/	As Congress considers a sweeping health care reform bill, groups are springing up that represent obscure aspects of the current system. The latest group raising concerns represents companies that provide flexible spending accounts. The group, known as Save Flexible Spending Plans, sent us a press release with the dire warning that a proposal approved by the Senate Finance Committee "would drastically restrict the use of flexible spending accounts (FSAs) in order to help pay for health care reform." "FSAs are a lifeline for working Americans, often making the difference between staying afloat and going into debt over health care needs, and sometimes between getting necessary treatment and avoiding it altogether because of the cost," said Joe Jackson, the organization's chairman and CEO of the benefits company WageWorks. To be clear, the group represents companies that would lose out if FSAs went away. We're examining the group's claim about the impact of the health care bill authored by Sen. Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who chairs the Finance Committee. For the uninitiated, flexible spending accounts are benefits that some employers offer. Here's how they work: You agree to send a portion of your paycheck to a flexible spending account that can be used for health care costs. You get those dollars tax-free, so you save money by avoiding Uncle Sam's taxes. The accounts have several restrictions. Employers can limit how much money you can save; typical limits are anywhere from $2,000 to $5,000 (though some employers set no limit). You have to save all your receipts and submit them to an administrator in most cases. And if you have any money in the account at the end of the year, your employer gets to keep it. Because of the use-it-or-lose-it provision, people tend to use these accounts for predictable health expenses, not emergencies. People who have the plans find them a good way to pay for co-pays, dental care, or special procedures that can be scheduled to match their contributions. People with more serious illnesses who have predictable costs also benefit significantly. Policymakers tend to dislike flexible spending accounts. According to this view, they unnecessarily complicate the tax code, and the use-it-or-lose-it provision encourages people to spend money on health care they don't really need. Because income taxes are progressive, the benefits of saving in an FSA go to higher earners and are negligible for people with low income. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning public-policy think tank, published a paper in June saying that health care reform should curtail flexible spending accounts . That would increase tax revenues to the federal government, which could be used to pay for subsidies for the uninsured. "The average FSA benefit is a few hundred bucks," said Chuck Marr, the center's director of federal tax policy. He said that's small potatoes and that Congress should focus more a sweeping reform bill. "In a world where resources are limited, this bill is trying to give coverage to people who don't have any." We checked Baucus' bill, which passed the committee on Tuesday. It does limit flexible spending accounts to $2,500 a year. It does not index them for inflation, which means that $2,500 will have less buying power as the years go by. Getting back to our statement, the organization Save Flexible Spending Plans said the Senate Finance Committee "would drastically restrict the use of flexible spending accounts (FSAs) in order to help pay for health care reform." Yes, it would restrict them, but even Save Flexible Spending Plans says the new restriction would affect only "one in five" beneficiaries. So this means by the group's own accounting that 80 percent of the people with FSAs would not be affected. That hardly seems drastic. We rate the group's statement Half True.

pomt-13765	"While Hillary Clinton plans a massive, and I mean massive, tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has run for president this year, Democrat or Republican."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/21/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-he-had-biggest-tax-cuts-any-2016/	During this acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, Donald Trump contrasted his stance on tax policy with that of his rival, Hillary Clinton. "While Hillary Clinton plans a massive, and I mean massive, tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has run for president this year, Democrat or Republican," Trump said. We’ll analyze both parts of this statement in order. Clinton’s tax increase Clinton does propose an increase in taxes, though it’s a stretch to call it massive The Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, an independent think tank, estimates that most Americans won’t be affected by Clinton’s proposed tax hikes because they are targeted at the highest earners. She would create a 4 percent surcharge on incomes over $5 million and impose a 30 percent minimum rate on adjusted gross incomes above $1 million; She would also limit itemized deduction benefits at 28 percent; raise rates on medium-term capital gains to between 27.8 percent and 47.4 percent; increase the top estate tax rate to 45 percent and reduce the threshold to $3.5 million; and limit the value of tax-deferred retirement accounts. These changes would fall most heavily on the richest taxpayers, and for them, the hit would indeed be substantial. For the top 5 percent of taxpayers, the increases would average $2,673, or reduction of a bit less than 1 percent in after-tax income. For the top 1 percent of taxpayers, the increases would average $78,000, which is equal to a 5 percent reduction in after-tax income. For the top one-tenth of 1 percent -- who earn $3.7 million or above -- the extra tax bite would be $520,000, or a 7.6 percent reduction in after-tax income. For the other 95 percent of taxpayers, the hit is relatively minor. Middle-income households would pay about $44 more on average, and the poorest filers would lose an additional $4. All told, Clinton’s plan would increase revenues collected by $1.1 trillion over 10 years, according to modeling by the Tax Policy Center. "That’s roughly a 2.5 percent increase in projected revenue for the decade," said Roberton Williams, a Tax Policy Center fellow. Williams acknowledged that the question of whether this counts as "massive" is a subjective question. Still, he said, "not in my book." Richard Borean, communications director of the more conservative Tax Foundation, concurred that the question is a subjective one. He did add that Clinton’s plan is far more modest than the one offered by her former rival for the Democratic nomination, Bernie Sanders. Sanders’ proposed revenue increase, according to the Tax Foundation’s own modeling, is more than 20 times bigger than Clinton’s. Trump’s tax cuts Trump is on solid ground with the second half of his statement. He would consolidate the existing seven income brackets (with rates from 10 to 39.6 percent) into three with rates at 10, 20 and 25 percent. He would also Increase the standard deduction from $6,300 to $25,000 for single filers and from $12,600 to $50,000 for joint filers and phase out most itemized deductions, except for charitable giving and mortgage interest. And he would eliminate the estate tax, the alternative minimum tax, the Affordable Care Act taxes, and the marriage penalty. The Tax Policy Center calculated that the average tax cuts for the top 1 percent would be $275,000, or 17.5 percent of after-tax income, and for the top 0.1 percent, they would be $1.3 million, or nearly 19 percent. Middle-income households, meanwhile, would get a cut of $2,700, or a 4.9 percent reduction. Those making the least would see a cut, too, but only of $128 or so, roughly 1 percent of after-tax income. The Tax Policy Center found that Trump’s plan would reduce revenues by the most of any candidate it analyzed. Revenues under Trump’s plan would fall by $9.5 trillion over 10 years, compared to $8.6 trillion under Ted Cruz’s plan and $6.8 trillion under Marco Rubio’s plan. (The center did not analyze the plans of several Republican candidates -- including John Kasich, Chris Christie and Ben Carson -- for a variety of reasons.) The Tax Foundation’s analyses agreed. "Trump’s plan is, in fact, the largest tax cut proposed by any candidate," Borean said. "His plan would reduce revenue by $10.14 trillion over 10 years after accounting for the impact on the economy, or $11.98 without." We’ll note, however, that economists are skeptical that Trump’s tax cuts would be sustainable, since they would require either massive cuts to discretionary federal spending or an explosion of new debt. "He says economic growth and cuts would make up for that, but it’s hard to imagine that it would be possible to do so," Williams said. Our ruling Trump said, "While Hillary Clinton plans a massive, and I mean massive, tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has run for president this year, Democrat or Republican." Clinton is indeed proposing a tax increase, though it can be described as "massive" for only the richest Americans. Meanwhile, Trump is correct that his tax cuts were the biggest of any 2016 candidate.

pomt-03288	Rick Scott "increased tuition at our state colleges and universities by double digits."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/aug/02/florida-democratic-party/rick-scott-increased-tuition-our-state-colleges-an/	Republican Gov. Rick Scott, who grew up with working-class parents, paid for college by working at a doughnut shop he bought with a friend and with help from the G.I. Bill. Now a millionaire and a former hospital executive facing re-election next year, Scott has tried to channel the pain of Florida families trying to pay for college. In April, he vetoed the Legislature’s 3 percent tuition hike. "It’s ridiculous how much tuition has gone up in the past five years," Scott said. "Families are struggling." Is wealthy Scott now the savior of the ramen-noodle eating, penny-pinching college crowd? Not so fast, says the Florida Democratic Party. Don’t forget about the first two legislative sessions under Scott. In July, the Democrats unveiled a new website www.realrickscott.com. (Ads for the site have appeared on PolitiFact Florida.) The attack website accuses Scott of trying to hide his "real record," including that he "increased tuition at our state colleges and universities by double digits." We decided to do our homework on how higher education tuition has changed under Scott. The complicated way tuition is set First, here's some background about tuition. The Legislature sets base tuition. If there is no base tuition increase provided in the state budget, tuition goes up by the rate of inflation. Individual universities can ask the Florida Board of Governors for an extra increase known as the "tuition differential." Together, the base tuition and tuition differential can add up to no more than a 15 percent increase. Technically, it’s the Board of Governors, not Scott, that gets to vote on a tuition differential increase. But Scott appoints that board, and he has asked their opinions about tuition raises in interviews. Florida has 11 existing universities -- a new one, Florida Polytechnic, will start enrolling students in 2014. Florida also has 28 state colleges and community colleges. Those schools don’t need permission from the Board of Governors. Instead, the individual boards of state can generally approve tuition increases. Scott's actions on tuition Here we will focus on the part of tuition that Scott clearly has power over: the base tuition increase. Under Scott’s first approved budget in 2011, the base tuition for universities increased by 8 percent -- the same as the preceding two years under Gov. Charlie Crist. For state colleges, the increase was also 8 percent. In 2012, Scott vetoed a bill that would have allowed the University of Florida and Florida State University unlimited flexibility to raise tuition. The Legislature did not grant any base tuition increase for universities that year, but it structured the budget in such a way that universities were expected to seek that 15 percent tuition differential, the Tampa Bay Times reported. (In reality, those increases were all over the map.) For state colleges (again, separate from state universities), the budget included a 5 percent tuition increase. So Scott didn’t have to sign a budget with a tuition hike -- even though schools received tuition increases that year from the Board of Governors. The Democrats arrive at their double-digit figure by adding the 8 percent in Scott’s first year to the 5 percent in Scott’s second year. But that 5 percent only applied to state colleges -- not universities. We asked the Florida Democratic Party why they included colleges and universities in the claim. Spokesman Joshua Karp noted that two other pages on their attack website specified "college tuition" only -- for example stating "hiking college tuition by double digits." "The distinction between colleges and universities is something very few papers make," he said. (Karp sent us a few articles in major newspapers that didn’t make it clear that the 5 percent only referred to colleges.) John Holdnak, chief financial and budget officer for the Florida College System, said he would not call the 8 percent increase one year followed by the 5 percent increase the second year a double-digit increase. "The annual tuition growth is less than double digits," he said. (One page of the Democrats’ website specifies that the 13 percent is over two years.) Holdnak gave us this example: an employee who gets a 3 percent raise one year, a 3 percent the next year and a 4 percent raise the third year would not say he received a 10 percent raise. This year, Scott vetoed the 3 percent tuition increase and encouraged universities to forgo the 1.7 percent automatic increase -- a few schools found a way to offset that hike, for example by decreasing fees. Scott isn’t to blame for a law that requires the automatic increase. It’s worth noting that despite increases, Florida’s tuition remains among the lowest in the country. Tuition has risen largely in response to the drop-off in state funding. Our ruling The Florida Democratic Party said Scott "increased tuition at our state colleges and universities by double digits." Democrats point to the base tuition increases of 8 percent in Scott’s first budget year and 5 percent in his second year. The state colleges did have those increases, but the universities only had the 8 percent hike -- not the 5 percent the next year. That line also didn’t specify a time period: that increase is over two years, not one. More recently, Scott has opposed additional tuition increases. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-12031	"Facts have come to light that indicate that a pivotal, close election was likely changed through voter fraud on November 8, 2016: New Hampshire’s U.S. Senate Seat, and perhaps also New Hampshire’s four Electoral College votes in the presidential election."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/sep/15/kris-kobach/there-evidence-voter-fraud-new-hampshire-kris-koba/	Kris Kobach, the Kansas Secretary of State and Vice Chairman of the Presidential Commission on Election Integrity, has alleged voter fraud in the New Hampshire 2016 election. But his evidence is circumstantial at best. Kobach penned a Breitbart column on Sept. 7, 2017, claiming that 5,313 fraudulent votes likely altered the results of the Senate race between Democrat Maggie Hassan and Republican Kelly Ayotte and the presidential general election. Hassan won her race by 1,017 votes, and Clinton won the state over President Donald Trump by 2,732 votes. "Facts have come to light that indicate that a pivotal, close election was likely changed through voter fraud on Nov. 8, 2016: New Hampshire’s U.S. Senate Seat, and perhaps also New Hampshire’s four electoral college votes in the presidential election," Kobach wrote. Kobach repeated his point in Manchester, N.H., on Sept. 12, 2017, during the second meeting of the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, which Trump formed to analyze vulnerabilities in the voting system after his widely debunked claim that millions of illegal voters participated in the election. Kobach didn’t respond to our request for comment but Kobach’s spokeswoman, Samantha Poetter, said he stood by his column after the meeting. "About 5,300 (voters) as of 10 months (after voting) still had not obtained a New Hampshire’s driver’s license, which is required of residents 60 days after moving to the state, nor had they registered a vehicle in the state of New Hampshire," Kobach said. "So this obviously is a subject of concern because there have often been anecdotal reports of people driving into New Hampshire because it’s a same day registration state and voting because it’s a battleground state." Kobach also said that unlike his state of Kansas, New Hampshire has people "flooding across the border to possibly cast a vote." Trump and his Cabinet have repeated baseless claims that thousands of Massachusetts residents "brought in on buses" voted illegally in New Hampshire, which we originally rated Pants on Fire. Do we have reason to doubt New Hampshire’s general election results? Again, not really. "The problem that has occurred because of what you wrote is that the question of whether our election as we have recorded is real, and valid," said New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner, who is a fellow member of the panel co-chaired by Kobach. "And it is real and valid." Gardner said that the facts laid out by Kobach don’t create proof for the accusation of voter fraud. He pointed out that in the column, as well as in his speech, Kobach had fudged the line between domicile and residency, which is crucial in understanding New Hampshire voting law. A state Supreme Court decision determined that a person can lawfully vote in New Hampshire while holding motor vehicle registration or a driver’s license in another state. In other words, it’s not necessary for the 5,313 voters in question to have become residents in order for their votes to be valid. That’s because eligible voters can be domiciled in the state without having to be residents — something Gardner acknowledged has caused confusion, even among polling officials. Domicile is defined as the place where a person sleeps, more than any other place, most nights of the year, or where they intend to return after a temporary time away. "The basic difference between a ‘resident’ and a person who merely has a New Hampshire ‘domicile,’ is that a ‘resident’ has manifested an intent to remain in New Hampshire for the indefinite future, while a person who merely has a New Hampshire ‘domicile’ has not manifested the same intent," Gardner wrote. College voters Kobach said that residents must obtain a New Hampshire’s driver’s license or register a vehicle in the state 60 days after moving, but that’s limited to drivers of motor vehicles. As multiple articles pointed out, college students are typical examples of people who would drive in another state without establishing residency in New Hampshire. New Hampshire Public Radio’s analysis of out-of-state IDs used to vote in November found that "the towns that see the highest rates of out-of-state IDs used at the polls are all home to college campuses." Kobach was unconvinced. "Being enrolled in a college does not free you from the legal obligation to become domiciled," Kobach said in his testimony. But that’s misleading, as becoming domiciled isn’t as complicated as he makes it sound. A voter can prove domicile using a New Hampshire driver’s license, a vehicle registration in the state, or a non-driver ID or other government issued photo identification that lists a New Hampshire address. But in some towns, providing a form issued by a New Hampshire college or university is sufficient to prove domicile. In Manchester, a voter can prove domicile by presenting a monthly bill, a medical bill, pay stubs showing a current address, or postmarked mail within the last 30 days. Other towns accept similar documentation. Otherwise, voters can simply sign an affidavit attesting they live there. In the case of affidavits, the state mails a letter to the listed address and if undeliverable or ignored, the case gets forwarded to the attorney general’s office for review. The other aspect of New Hampshire law that lends to the confusion is that alongside 15 other states, it has a same-day voter registration policy. "The result is that yes, it is possible and legal for someone to drive into a polling place in a car with out-of-state tags, register to vote, and vote," Fergus Cullen, who ran the New Hampshire Republican Party from 2007-08, told PolitiFact in February. "Of course they have to sign affidavits and they would be risking significant legal penalties if they voted in more than one place or state. The odds of being caught are pretty high." According to the New Hampshire Department of State and Department Safety, 196 people are being investigated as possibly having voted in New Hampshire and one other state — but even that isn’t proof that they did. How people voted "Until further research is done and until you make the next cut to find out how many are non-domiciled and then the final cut to actually determine how they voted, we will never know the answer regarding the legitimacy of that election," Kobach said in the panel. But Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap, another member of the committee who affirmed New Hampshire’s voting integrity, said Kobach’s need to find out how voters cast their ballot was unnecessary in determining fraud, as fraudulent votes don’t necessarily equal votes against the Republican candidates. "We shouldn’t know how they voted," Dunlap said. "There’s a secret ballot, and it protects the voter." Dunlap also said Kobach was conflating fraud with the oft-contested New Hampshire voting statute that allows non-residents to vote. Kobach expressed his support for New Hampshire's Republican-backed SB 3, a recent law that calls on those registering to vote within 30 days of an election to provide documents that show they live where they are voting. A judge blocked the law's penalties. Our ruling Kobach said, "Facts have come to light that indicate that a pivotal, close election was likely changed through voter fraud on November 8, 2016: New Hampshire’s U.S. Senate Seat, and perhaps also New Hampshire’s four Electoral College votes in the presidential election." He cited 5,313 votes cast with out-of-state IDs, but New Hampshire law says there’s nothing inherently fraudulent about them, as a person can lawfully vote in New Hampshire while holding motor vehicle registration or a driver’s license in another state. As of yet, there is no evidence proving fraud, or that fraudulent votes pivoted the election against Trump and Ayotte. We rate this statement False.

pomt-13064	Obamacare "is not a popular law."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/nov/17/paul-ryan/donald-trump-and-paul-ryan-threatening-repeal-and-/	From Donald Trump to Paul Ryan to Ron Johnson, "repeal and replace" has been the mantra of national Republicans almost since Obamacare became law in 2010. With Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton in the White House, of course, the Affordable Care Act wasn’t going anywhere. But now, with the GOP not only in control of Congress but having won the presidency, Obamacare is in jeopardy -- even if repeal isn’t necessarily easy and the replacement not entirely clear. During the campaign, Trump pledged to ask Congress to repeal the law the first day he takes office in January 2017. But in recent days, he has indicated a willingness to perhaps amend the law, rather than repeal and replace it. So, where does the rest of the country stand on Obamacare? On Nov. 9, 2016, the day after Trump defeated Clinton and Ryan and Johnson were re-elected, Ryan held a news conference in his hometown of Janesville, Wis. Asked about repealing and replacing, the House speaker reaffirmed that that is his aim, and he made this declaration: "This health care law is not a popular law." Is he right? For the most part, yes. When Americans are asked about the Affordable Care Act, more generally disapprove than approve of it. That’s true in the latest polling and in surveys done throughout 2016. But there is more to consider in the numbers. Overall popularity To back Ryan’s claim, his office cited a Politico/Harvard poll of likely voters from late-September 2016. We found two more-recent polls, takne in late-October 2016 of registered voters, that found similar results. Politico/Harvard poll How well is the Affordable Care Act working? Very poorly/Somewhat poorly: 54% Very well/Somewhat well: 43% New York Times/CBS News poll Approve/disapprove of the 2010 health care law? Disapprove: 54% Approve: 39% Pew Research Center poll: Approve/disapprove of the 2010 health care law? Disapprove: 53% Approve: 45% Averaging the 16 national polls taken throughout 2016 that have asked about Obamacare produces similar results, according to Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette University Law School poll: 47 percent said they have an unfavorable opinion or disapprove of it, while 41 percent said favorable or approve. So, it’s fair to say that if the question is about Obamacare overall, more Americans have a negative view than a positive one. At the same time, it’s not clear that Americans want repeal. When Pew asked what Congress should do with the law, 51 percent said expand (40 percent) the law or leave it as is (11 percent), while 45 percent said repeal it. And the picture changes a bit if you go deeper, particularly with polls done by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a research center widely seen as a source of objective data that has surveyed on Obamacare since 2010. Other views In Kaiser’s mid-October 2016 poll, 45 percent of adults said they had a favorable opinion and 45 percent said unfavorable. That tie reflects the partisan divide in the country. "Everything that you hear from the public about the ACA is seen through a partisan lens," said Mollyann Brodie, Kaiser’s head public opinion and survey research, referring to Kaiser’s seven years worth of polling on the law. Indeed, the poll found that 76 percent of Democrats had a favorable opinion of the law and 83 percent of Republicans had an unfavorable view. It’s worth noting, though, that like the Pew poll, there was some sign of popularity when respondents were asked by Kaiser what the next president and Congress should do with the law: 49 percent said expand it or implement it as is, compared to 41 percent who said repeal it or scale it back. (That’s not a new sentiment. In April 2014, PolitiFact National gave a Mostly True to this claim: "One thing that is much more unpopular than the Affordable Care Act is repealing the Affordable Care Act.") Two more Kaiser questions were not clear one way or the other, in terms of the law’s popularity: Are you and your family better off as a result of the law? The most popular answer -- 50 percent -- was that the law has not made much of a difference to them. Is the country as a whole better off? This was a tie -- 39 percent said better off, 39 percent said worse off. A final point before we close: Some parts of the law get high ratings, although the data isn’t as recent on this. Kaiser’s December 2014 poll asked about five features of the law and three were rated as very or somewhat favorable by 75 percent or more of the respondents: The exchanges, where people who don’t get employer-provided coverage can shop for insurance; financial aid to help lower-income people not covered by employers to buy insurance; the option for states to expand Medicaid to cover more people. (Sixty-four percent had a very or somewhat unfavorable view of the requirement to have insurance or pay a fine.) Our rating Ryan said: Obamacare "is not a popular law." A majority in two national polls done in late-October 2016 say they have an unfavorable opinion of the Affordable Care Act. Those findings track polls taken throughout 2016 -- unfavorable or disapprove leads favorable or approve. Similarly, the majority in a September 2016 poll say the law is working somewhat or very poorly. But it’s worth noting that in one October 2016 poll, favorable and unfavorable tied. And in two polls, expanding or keeping the law as-is was favored by more people than repealing it or scaling it back. Overall, Ryan’s statement is accurate, but needs more information – our definition of Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1eeb5445-8689-49d1-97a0-300a30fa3225	None	Paul Ryan	None	None	None	2016-11-17T05:00:00	2016-11-09	['None']
pomt-06287	Says unemployment in Ohio "is significantly higher than the unemployment rate in states which are not forced union states and it’s always been that way."	false	/ohio/statements/2011/nov/21/maurice-thompson/ohio-unemployment-significantly-higher-right-work-/	Just days after a two-to-one margin of victory for a "health care freedom" amendment to Ohio’s constitution on the November ballot, the band of Tea Party activists and other conservatives behind that initiative announced a new amendment they would seek. Next up would be a petition drive to get a new issue on the ballot that the group describes as a "workplace freedom amendment," but which is usually called a right-to-work issue. This proposed amendment would forbid forcing a person to join a union as a condition of employment, and it is similar to a proposed amendment that was stomped at the ballot by Ohio voters in 1958. At the well-attended Statehouse news conference Nov. 10, supporters of the amendment argued that not having a right to work law was hurting Ohio’s economy in competing for jobs and hurting the state’s economic growth. One of those speaking on behalf of the right to work bill was Maurice Thompson, the executive director of the 1851 Center for Constitutional Law, the author of the proposed amendment. During his remarks, Thompson attempted to make the case that economic conditions were better in right to work states than in Ohio, citing the Buckeye State’s unemployment rate. "We’re hovering around 9-10 percent unemployment at any given time, which is significantly higher than the unemployment rate in states which are not forced union states and it’s always been that way," Thompson said. Just minutes later—at a separate statehouse news conference—House Democrats argued much the opposite -- that unemployment rates in right to work states actually aren’t any lower than Ohio’s. So it seemed like a good time to check into Thompson’s statement. Had Ohio’s unemployment rate "always" been higher? It’s fairly easy to compare unemployment rates in different states thanks to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, which diligently tracks and compiles the information each month. Politifact asked Thompson for a source listing right-to-work states and sent us a link to the National Right to Work Legal Defense Fund, which lists 22 states primarily in the south and west which have right-to-work statutes on the books. The fund has a database to the relevant section of law in each state so the fund’s information on what states have the laws looked to be unbiased. We compared Ohio’s unemployment rate of 9.1 for September 2011 to those 22 states and found that eight right-to-work states had higher unemployment rates, 13 had lower unemployment rates and one was precisely the same (Arizona). For what its worth, Ohio’s rate dipped to 9.0 for October, but we’re sticking with the September figures here, as they were the most current numbers available when Thompson made his claim. Three of the 13 states with lower unemployment rates in September were within one percentage point of Ohio’s — Idaho at 9.0 percent, Texas at 8.5 percent and Arkansas at 8.3 percent. If the jobless rate in Ohio is less than one percent greater, does that count as "significantly higher," as Thompson said? We’re not convinced. Thus, we are left with 10 of 22 right-to-work states with "significantly" lower unemployment rates than Ohio. The tail end of Thompson’s statement makes a second claim — that Ohio has always had an unemployment rate higher than right-to-work states. To test this portion of his statement, we looked at both the high and low water marks for Ohio’s unemployment rate over the last decade to give a s snapshot of how Ohio stacked up against right-to-work states during both good and bad economic times. When Ohio had its lowest point of unemployment in the state’s history — 3.8 percent in January 2001 — there were still eight right-to-work states with lower unemployment. Fourteen had higher unemployment rates. When Ohio had the highest rate of unemployment over the last decade — 10.6 percent in Feb. 2010 — 18 states had lower unemployment rates. Four right-to-work states had higher unemployment rates. We think it’s likely that Ohio has ranked somewhere between No.5 and No. 15 in highest unemployment rates when compared to the 22 right-to-work states. Thompson also forwarded information from Stanley Greer, a staffer with the National Right to Work Legal Defense Fund, who argued that on the average right-to-work states have slightly lower unemployment rates than states without the laws. Greer also produced statistics that argue that private employment has fallen in non right-to-work states but grown in right-to-work states over the past decade. Frankly, we don’t think that information is pertinent to evaluating the truthfulness of Thompson’s claim, which focused solely on the unemployment rate in Ohio as compared to right-to-work states. So let’s return to that. Thompson flatly stated that Ohio’s unemployment rate was "significantly higher" than the rates in right-to-work states and has "always" been that way. But figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that 12 of 22 right-to-work states have unemployment rates that are very similar to Ohio’s or greater. Less than half have "significantly" lower unemployment rates. As for Ohio "always" having had a higher unemployment rate, a check of Ohio’s rate at its highest and lowest points over the past decade shows 14 of the right-to-work states had higher unemployment rates than Ohio when the rate was at its lowest. And when Ohio’s rate was at its highest, there still were four right-to-work states with higher jobless rates. Ohio’s unemployment rate is not higher than all right-to-work states and very likely has never been. Thompson’s claim is not accurate. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate his claim False.

pomt-10680	"Thanks to President Bush's policies....The income gap is now higher than at any time since the Great Depression."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/15/hillary-clinton/cant-blame-bush/	In her speeches about the economy, Sen. Hillary Clinton, D-N.Y., often makes the point that the gap between rich and poor has grown during Bush's presidency. "Thanks to President Bush's policies, the poor and middle classes are suffering economically, while the rich are prospering," Clinton said during a Nov. 19, 2007 speech in Knoxville, Iowa. "The income gap is now higher than at any time since the Great Depression." In 2005, "the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans held 22 percent of America's income. That's an astonishing figure, and it is the highest level of income inequality since the beginning of the Great Depression in 1929," she said. Clinton's figures are essentially right. She gets them from an analysis of U.S. tax returns published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics in 2005 and updated this year, which found that the top 1 percent of earners, those making more than $350,500 per year, earned 21.3 percent of the nation's total income in 2005. The U.S. Census Bureau shows a similar disparity, with the top 5 percent of Americans earning 22.3 percent of the income in 2006. Those in the top 20 percent earned about half of the nation's income, while the bottom 20 percent earned just 3.4 percent of the income. However, while some of Bush's policies have favored the rich, economists say it is not fair to link the president to the rising income gap itself. This is a longtime trend that began to soar in the 1980s and has persisted throughout several presidencies. In fact, the income gap also reached new highs and grew more quickly during the administration of Bill Clinton, a Democrat and the husband of Sen. Clinton, than it has under President Bush. Economists point to several reasons for the growth in disparity between the very rich and the rest of us, including the decline of labor unions, the loss of high-paying manufacturing jobs to cheap labor overseas, rising executive pay, and the relative drop of the minimum wage from 1981 to 2007. While goods and services became more expensive, the minimum wage stayed the same. Bush has, however, exacerbated the after-tax income inequality with tax cuts that disproportionately help the rich, economists said. He also has resisted congressional attempts to cut costs for the working poor, such as by opposing an expansion of a popular children's health insurance program that he says helps some who don't need it. "(Bush) passively accepted many of the economic trends that pushed up inequality," said Gary Burtless, a senior fellow in economic studies at the liberal-leaning Brookings Institution. "But he is not mainly to blame for increased inequality." Clinton is correct, that the income gap is soaring. But she's wrong to lay the blame on Bush. We find her statement Half-True.

pomt-02254	Says Bruce Braley took "tens of thousands from his friends in the health insurance industry" and gave them "special favors" by voting for Obamacare.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/11/freedom-partners/freedom-partners-ad-accuses-rep-bruce-braley-givin/	A new ad by Freedom Partners -- a group that has served as a hub for funding by billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch -- recently began airing ads against Democratic Senate candidates, targeting them for their support of President Barack Obama’s health care law. The group had been little known until the Washington Post reported in January that Freedom Partners had "raised $256 million from unknown sources, money that was then transferred to a complex network of LLCs and political nonprofits that do not disclose their donors." By airing the new ads against Democratic Senate candidates, it appears that Freedom Partners is "bringing in-house many of the functions it financed through other groups in the last campaign," the Post reported. One of the Freedom Partners ads attacks Rep. Bruce Braley, D-Iowa, who’s running to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin. Braley will face one of several potential Republican candidates in a general election that independent observers consider competitive. Here’s the full narration of the ad: "No one likes it when politicians give special favors. Congressman Bruce Braley voted for Obamacare. The government spent millions of taxpayer dollars to promote it. Now, health insurance companies stand to make billions. And Bruce Braley? He takes tens of thousands from his friends in the health insurance industry. For Iowans, it's canceled policies and higher costs. That's not right. Call Bruce Braley. Tell him: Stand with Iowa. Stop supporting Obamacare." There’s a lot to chew on here, but we decided to narrow our focus to the claim that Braley took "tens of thousands from his friends in the health insurance industry" and gave them "special favors" by voting for Obamacare. Did Braley take "tens of thousands from his friends in the health insurance industry"? This claim reminded us of the scene from Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery in which Dr. Evil (Mike Meyers) threatens to unleash some horrible threat upon the earth unless he is paid -- pausing for dramatic effect -- "one million dollars." His nonplussed advisers gently suggest that he raise the ransom amount, since in today’s dollars, $1 million isn’t really all that much. In Braley’s case, yes -- he took "tens of thousands" from the insurance industry. But saying that misses a whole bunch of important context. Braley has accepted a total of $83,500 from individuals and PACs connected to the insurance industry since his first campaign for the House in the 2006 campaign cycle, according to data gleaned from the Center for Responsive Politics, an independent collector of campaign finance information. That includes $24,250 so far during the 2014 campaign cycle. In isolation, this may sound like a lot. But here’s the context. First, this is money from the "insurance" sector, not necessarily the health insurance sector. Once you strip out car insurance companies, homeowner insurance companies, life insurance companies and the like, the amount is much less. We asked the Center for Responsive Politics to do the stripping for us. Here are the results: Over the last decade, Braley has received a total of $16,000 from health insurance political action committees: $8,500 from Humana, $3,000 from Delta Dental, $2,500 from VSP Holdings and $2,000 from AFLAC. He received an additional $4,500 from eight individual donors employed by a health insurance company, all but one donation smaller than $750. Altogether, this is $20,500 from health insurance sources -- less than a quarter of his take from insurers more generally, and about $2,000 for every year he’s served in Congress. "This is not a lot of money to influence a huge vote like that," said Norman Ornstein, a congressional scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. If we are going to compare Braley to other Senate candidates on an apples-to-apples basis, it’s only feasible to use the the Center for Responsive Politics’ standard data for "insurance" companies. So how does Braley’s insurance haul compare to that other lawmakers? Not very impressively. Among all Senate candidates running in 2014, Braley ranks 55th. Since there are just 36 Senate races this year, some of which feature minimal opposition to incumbents, that’s pretty low indeed for a sitting House member in a competitive seat to rank 55th. And how big a share of Braley’s warchest comes from this broader swath of the insurance industry? Not very big. The insurance industry ranks 19th on the list of biggest sector donors to Braley’s campaigns over his entire career. For the 2014 cycle, insurance ranks 16th among all sectors donating to Braley. In all, insurance donations account for less than 1 percent of all the cash Braley has raised during his political career. (The industry that ranks No. 1 -- giving $4,084,645 over the course of Braley’s career -- is "lawyers and law firms." This connection recently caused a major embarrassment for Braley when he was caught on videotape jabbing Sen. Chuck Grassley, the popular Republican he’s seeking to join in the Senate, as "a farmer from Iowa who never went to law school." Slate’s John Dickerson joked that Braley’s farm-state gaffe was so massive "that the Environmental Protection Agency may seek to regulate it.") Was it a special favor to the health insurance industry to vote for Obamacare? For one thing, it’s not as simple as the ad says -- the insurance industry hardly loves every aspect of the law, so it’s not clear that voting for it was an undiluted gift for the industry. "In particular, the medical loss ratio that limits their profits and requires 80 cents on each dollar be spent on insurance recipients keeps their profits from soaring," Ornstein said. In addition, it strains logic to think that Braley would have turned from an opponent of the law, or even agnostic about it, to a supporter of it simply because of the desires of donors who collectively gave him a fraction of one percent of his total campaign warchest. It’s not as if Braley had built his political career on being a foe of a health care overhaul. Like most Democrats, he supported policies to lower the number of uninsured Americans. During his first campaign for the House in 2006, "Braley called for expanding health care for the uninsured," according to the 2008 edition of the Almanac of American Politics. And in September 2009, when the House health care bill was on its way to the floor, the Des Moines Register reported that Braley said that the often divisive town meetings about health care had only stiffened his resolve. "You've been out there talking about your values for health care reform and, for some of us, it's made us more dedicated than ever to doing something meaningful about health care reform," Braley said, according to the newspaper. Combined, Braley’s past promises and pressure from his party are likely to have outweighed any campaign donations from the industry, Ornstein said. The partisan pressure to toe the line on the health care bill was especially strong because it was the No. 1 legislative priority of a president from his own party, and the vote would be decided essentially along party lines. "Political science scholars have spilled much ink and used countless hours of computer time linking these kinds of ordinary contributions to voting outcomes, and have come up with very little," said Burdett Loomis, a University of Kansas political scientist. A final point: If the ad considers donations from the insurance industry to be the linchpin of a politician’s support for Obamacare, how can this explain the overall pattern of donations by the insurance industry? As it turns out, nine of the 13 Senate candidates who received the most money from the insurance industry in 2014 are Republicans, a list headed by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who received $231,800. Yet despite the backing of the industry, none of these Republicans voted for Obamacare. And what about Braley’s fellow Iowan, Grassley? Grassley -- who did not vote for Obamacare -- has received $318,202 from the insurance industry in the 2014 cycle, or about 13 times as much as Braley did over the same period. And the insurance industry’s ranking among the industries donating to Grassley? It ranks first. Freedom Partners’ argument A spokesman for Freedom Partners, James Davis, said just looking at the size of the donations misses the point. "What's important to understand is that our ad isn't just about dollar amounts, it's about hypocrisy," Davis said. He pointed to an ad by the pro-Braley independent group Senate Majority PAC that said Braley wants to "hold insurance companies accountable" and "knows we can’t go back to letting insurance companies deny coverage for pre-existing conditions and kick people off their coverage when they get sick." (Both were policies outlawed by passage of Obamacare, and which would be at risk of re-emerging after an Obamacare repeal unless specifically protected.) "The point we're making is: How can Rep. Braley claim he's standing up to health insurance companies, while at the same time taking their campaign donations and supporting Obamacare – a huge boon to the health insurance industry?" Davis said. "It's not about where he falls in the line of donations – it's about saying one thing and doing another." However, we don’t think the use of the phrase "special favors" and "friends in the health insurance industry" suggests hypocrisy. Rather, it all but suggests that Braley is corrupt, pursuing damaging policies because he gains personally from interested parties. And on that score, the evidence is thin indeed. We asked Freedom Partners if they had any evidence of favors Braley had done for specific companies, but the group did not reply. Our ruling Freedom Partners’ ad claims that Braley took "tens of thousands from his friends in the health insurance industry" and gave them "special favors" by voting for Obamacare. Braley did take tens of thousands of dollars from the insurance industry, though from all types of insurers, not just health insurers. However, Braley, like most Democrats, had campaigned on expanding health coverage to the uninsured, and then, faced with a landmark and highly partisan vote, carried through on his stated intentions. It’s ridiculous to suggest that donors who contributed less than 1 percent of his warchest weighed more heavily on his vote than his ideology, his past campaign promises and his partisan affiliation.

pomt-04035	"Approximately 43 percent of all college grades today are A's, an increase of 28 percentage points since 1960."	true	/texas/statements/2013/jan/31/thomas-lindsay/thomas-lindsay-says-43-percent-college-grades-are-/	More than 4 in 10 college grades are A’s and that’s way up from 50 years ago, Thomas K. Lindsay of the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation recently wrote. In a Jan. 12, 2013, opinion column in the Austin American-Statesman, Lindsay prefaced his claim by saying students study less than they once did. "Worse, grades during this period have, paradoxically, increased. Approximately 43 percent of all college grades today are A’s, an increase of 28 percentage points since 1960," Lindsay said. We're not delving into how much students study. But a reader urged us to check on A’s over the decades. Lindsay, director of the foundation’s Center for Higher Education, soon pointed us to a July 14, 2011, New York Times blog post summarizing a study of grades awarded at colleges and universities over the past several decades. "Most recently, about 43 percent of all letter grades given were A’s, an increase of 28 percentage points since 1960 and 12 percentage points since 1988," the blog post says. "The distribution of B’s has stayed relatively constant; the growing share of A’s instead comes at the expense of a shrinking share of C’s, D’s and F’s. In fact, only about 10 percent of grades awarded are D’s and F’s." According to the post, "private colleges and universities are by far the biggest offenders on grade inflation," with A’s and B’s representing 73 percent of all grades awarded at public schools by the end of last decade, and 86 percent of all grades awarded at private schools. The cited study was conducted by Stuart Rojstaczer, a former Duke University geophysics professor, and Christopher Healy, an associate professor of computer science at Furman University in South Carolina. To our inquiry, Rojstaczer guided us to an online copy of the study, which said that grades in recent years were compiled from web searches, other studies and information from 135 colleges and universities, including "mostly continuous data" from 14 schools covering the 1960s or earlier to the 2000s. For the early 1960s, 11 to 13 schools were "represented by our national averages," the study says. In 1960, the study says, C was the most common grade nationwide and D’s and F’s accounted for more grades, combined, than A’s. By 1965, though, "B had supplanted C as the most common grade, and D’s and F’s were becoming increasingly less common." "From the early 1960s to the mid-1970s, grades rose rapidly across the nation, and A became the second most common grade awarded," the study says. After a dip in A’s in the 1970s into the early 1980s, the study says, from 1984 to the mid-2000s, the proportion of A’s increased by a factor of 1.5. "By 2008, A’s were nearly three times more common than they were in 1960," the study says. "For the 135 schools in our database with contemporary data, A’s are handed out 43% of the time on average," the study says. We sought more information on the A’s from 1960. By email, Healy told us the data referring to 1960 may have included information from the years 1959 and 1961 since for a given college, the researchers could have had data for one year but not the next. As of late January 2013, he said, he had grade information for that period from 16 institutions, up from 14 or so when the study was published. He emailed us a list indicating the institutions providing grades from around 1960 include Penn State University; the University of California, Berkeley; the University of Minnesota; the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill; the University of Wisconsin; and Rice University. Both researchers said it’s reasonable to compare course grades at 14 schools or so in 1960 to course grades gleaned from 135 institutions in recent years. Healy said the mix of circa-1960 schools, which included private institutions such as Pomona College and Furman, represents more selective institutions compared with the bigger present-day sample, which includes more less-selective colleges. "So, if anything, if there had been no grade inflation, one would expect the sample of today's colleges to show slightly lower grades than in our 1960 sample," Healy said. He elaborated by phone: "A less-selective school would award fewer As, hence there would be less of gap." For a long time, he said, more-selective schools have tended to award more generous grades. "They also tend to have the best students," he said. In Texas, Texas A&M University and Texas State University have provided grades to the researches. At A&M in 1985, the researchers say, 26 percent of grades given in undergraduate courses were A’s compared with 39 percent in 2011. At Texas State in 1960, 14 percent of grades were A’s; the tally in 2007 was 34 percent, the researchers say. Healy said that at both institutions, the prevalence of A’s slightly trailed national averages. For outside perspective, we asked Shouping Hu, a Florida State University professor of higher education, to evaluate the 2011 study. Hu, who edited a 2005 book on changes in student grades, said by email that there has been an upward trend in college grades, though it may not be accurate to attribute that to "grade inflation." We weren’t sure how to interpret that; Hu did not elaborate. By phone, Rojstaczer commented by saying that at some schools, the quality of students has increased. "You can attribute up to 30 percent of the rise in grades at some institutions to students being demonstrably better than they once were," he said. Still, he said, it’s not plausible that 43 percent of students, on average, are doing excellent class work, which means there has been grade inflation. Next, we asked Arthur Levine, president of the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation and former president of Teachers College at Columbia University, for thoughts on the 2011 study. Levine said by phone that while grades from 14 colleges represent a small sample, that’s not problematic if researchers also check course grades at the institutions in subsequent years--which Rojstaczer and Healy did. If so, Levine said, "they’re comparing apples to apples." Levine has incorporated surveys of students about their GPAs into his own work. In 1969, he said, 7 percent of surveyed students at two- and four-year colleges said their GPA was A-minus or higher. In 2009, he said, 41 percent of students reported as much. Broadly, Levine said, grade inflation started when professors took it easier on male students to spare them from being sent to Vietnam. The 2011 study says that after the Vietnam era, a decline in A’s lasted roughly a decade, but the share of A’s began to rise again in the mid-1980s. Healy told us that he believes factors behind the renewed upward sweep include professors being more mindful of student evaluations and feeling pressure to award high grades so that students can advance to law or medical school. Our ruling Lindsay wrote that about 43 percent of all college grades today are A's, an increase of 28 percentage points from 1960. That’s supported by a 2011 study covering grades from 1960 into the 2000s, making this claim True.	None	Thomas Lindsay	None	None	None	2013-01-31T06:00:00	2013-01-12	['None']
pomt-01357	Says a bill he vetoed to give driver licenses to certain immigrants known as Dreamers would have changed "nothing."	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/oct/20/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-bill-give-drivers-licenses-daca-im/	Gov. Rick Scott and Charlie Crist are competing for the Hispanic vote, leading the candidates to argue about their stances on everything from the Cuba embargo to rights for illegal immigrants. During the Telemundo debate Oct. 10, the debate moderator asked the candidates to explain their conflicting views on driver’s licenses for illegal immigrants brought to the United States as children. In 2013, the Legislature passed a bill to give driver licenses to those with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, sometimes called "Dreamers." Scott vetoed it. Crist, a Democrat, said during the debate: "I’m in favor of a driver’s license for Dreamers. The governor recently signed a bill where they can have in-state tuition. And that was a good thing to do. But if you can’t drive to school, or you can’t drive to your job, good luck getting to work." Scott, a Republican, responded: "The driver’s license bill that was passed, nothing changed. Those same individuals have the right to get a Florida driver’s license today." Scott was partially correct and partially misleading. Floridians who get Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, called DACA, generally get work permits, which they can use to get driver’s licenses. But he is overstating the situation when he says "nothing changed," because that bill would have affirmatively given those immigrants the right to use their DACA forms to get a driver’s license, even if their work permit didn’t arrive simultaneously. Scott vetoed the driver license bill In 2012, Obama announced DACA, which allows illegal immigrants who came to the country as children to apply for a renewable, temporary status that suspends deportation, as long as they can prove they are law abiding and meet other requirements. As of the end of June 2014, about 580,000 individuals nationwide received initial deferred action including 23,196 in Florida. In 2013, Florida lawmakers proposed HB 235. The proposal would allow Dreamers to use their new federal status as a way to obtain a temporary driver license. A Florida House analysis said that without the law, Dreamers would first have to receive an employment authorization card before they could receive a temporary driver license. In April 2013, the Florida bill sailed through unanimously in the Senate and with only two "no" votes in the House. Scott vetoed the bill June 4, 2013. In his veto message, Scott bashed the Obama administration for implementing DACA and then argued that the bill was unnecessary: "Already, Florida law allows those with a federal employment authorization card, without regard to their deferred action status, to obtain a temporary Florida driver license. Although the Legislature may have been well intentioned in seeking to expedite the process to obtain a temporary driver license, it should not have been done by relying on a federal government policy adopted without legal basis." PolitiFact Florida asked spokespersons for Scott’s office and campaign to explain his evidence that the bill would not have changed anything and if that was the case why he bothered vetoing it. The only response we received was a copy of Scott’s veto. Democrats and immigrant rights’ groups criticized Scott’s veto and characterized it as a blow to Hispanics. But some news reports characterized Scott’s driver license veto as largely symbolic since immigrants could still get a driver license with the federal work permit. The ACLU of Florida, which criticized Scott’s veto, sent a letter to the state Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles stating "the veto should have no impact on DHSMV’s current practice of granting driver’s licenses to current DACA recipients who have employment authorization." Federal immigration officials told PolitiFact Florida that people apply for DACA and the work permit at the same time and nearly everyone gets both. United States Citizenship and Immigration Service approved 591,555 requests for DACA between Aug. 15, 2012 and July 31, 2014. During the same period, the agency denied 635 applications for work permits. Potential reasons include failing to sign the forms or provide property documentation. Most of the immigration law experts we interviewed said that generally applicants get DACA and work permits at the same time, though some had heard anecdotes about people who got their DACA days, weeks or months before the work permit. Since such a delay could occur, the Legislature wanted to give these immigrants the right to use DACA to get their driver’s licenses as quickly as possible. "It was basically to give those folks an opportunity to get their driver’s license right away," bill sponsor state Rep. Randolph Bracy, D-Orlando, told PolitiFact Florida. "Sometimes they get their approval letter and work permit at the same time but sometimes they don’t. It was just a show of support toward the Dreamers and said ‘we are behind you.’ " Our ruling Scott said that "nothing changed" for certain illegal immigrants to get driver licenses in a bill he vetoed. There was a change in the bill: It would have affirmatively stated that immigrants with DACA approval could use that documentation to get driver’s licenses. Scott vetoed the bill, so immigrants don’t have that right. However, applicants for DACA simultaneously apply for a work permit and generally get their approvals around the same time. If Scott hadn’t vetoed the bill, it would have meant that those who get DACA first wouldn’t have to wait for their work permit, although it is sometimes a short wait. The claim is partially accurate in that immigrants who get DACA will likely get a work permit and they can use that work permit to get the driver’s license. However, Scott exaggerated when he said "nothing changed" in the bill he vetoed. We rate this claim Half True. Editor's note: This report initially appeared with conflicted rulings. The correct ruling is Half True.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2014-10-20T18:01:47	2014-10-10	['None']
pomt-11958	"In 2017, I've done 17 town halls."	half-true	/texas/statements/2017/oct/04/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-asked-if-hes-interacting-texans-says-hes-/	He’s not Waldo. But could it be that U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas doesn’t get personally grilled by constituents very often? Cruz, a Republican poised to seek re-election in 2018, hardly has a reputation of avoiding attention. After all, he ran for president shortly after making waves in Washington and held on as the last viable Republican alternate to Donald Trump. Regardless, the Houston lawyer was told during the 2017 Texas Tribune Festival about a Democratic challenger’s suggestion that Cruz hadn’t visited small Texas towns during the term he won in 2012. "Do you do enough interaction with your constituents, Sen. Cruz?" interviewer Evan Smith asked. Cruz replied: "That is a huge part of the job. In 2017, I’ve done 17 town halls." We wondered about that. A town hall, Cruz spokesman Phil Novack later noted by email, is defined by Merriam-Webster as "an event at which a public official or political candidate addresses an audience by answering questions posed by individual members." By that definition, Novack was nudging, town halls don’t have to be open to just anybody to ask anything. Indeed, when we looked, Merriam-Webster followed its definition with this sample sentence: "Town halls have lost some of their spontaneity. The 80 or so undecided voters chosen for Tuesday's event must submit their questions in advance and moderator Candy Crowley of CNN will decide which people to call on." Cruz’s office lists 19 events Novack otherwise told us Cruz had held 19 town halls with Texas constituents in 2017, all "organized by third parties who determined attendees, where" the senator "has taken unvetted questions from anyone in the crowd--at businesses, factories, chambers of commerce, and in public venues." Novack said three of the gatherings--which would be 16 percent--"were open for the general public to register and attend." Those, he said, were hosted by Concerned Veterans for America, a group that seeks to shift veterans hospitals from the federal government to a nonprofit corporation. Eleven of the 19 events were open to reporters, Novack said, four were aired live. Novack provided a chart specifying each event, its date and location, which shows three events were hosted by business chambers of commerce and a dozen were hosted by business groups or specific businesses. Individual businesses hosted 11 of the listed events that weren’t open to the general public, according to the chart. The businesses, including Division Laundry & Cleaners in San Antonio, Sysco Central Texas in New Braunfels and Igloo Products Corp. in Katy, had employee town halls with Cruz, the chart says. The veterans group, per the chart, hosted Cruz at July events in McKinney, Austin and Houston. On Aug. 24, the chart says, the Border Patrol union hosted the senator at an El Paso meeting. By email to our inquiry, a CVA spokesman, Jim Fellinger, told us each CVA event with Cruz was open to the public by registration, without the group screening out anybody who registered. "Participants were given the opportunity to ask questions by submitting question cards that were handed out at the beginning of the event," Fellinger said. "These events involved a discussion about bringing greater health care choice to the Department of Veterans Affairs."

Ted Cruz, Sept. 28, 2017 We also asked Novack to share 2017 events Cruz had in Texas that were open to the public without registration--where anyone could ask a question on any topic. Novack replied by email: "I appreciate your efforts to move the goalposts but we’ll stick with the premise of your original question to us" about town halls. Experts evaluate Cruz's claim Next, we shared our annotated version of the chart by email with academic experts and requested appraisals of Cruz’s statement that he’d done 17 "town halls." Several deemed the claim inaccurate because most of the tallied events, especially meetings limited to business employees, weren’t forums open to all or likely to encourage wide-open questions and answers. A Duquesne University professor, Mike Dillon, replied: "The term ‘town hall’ implies an event is open to the entire community and that competing ideas will be welcomed and discussed. It seems these town halls are open only to the people from the sections of ‘town’ that support Ted Cruz. These are scripted pseudo-events," Dillon wrote, "not genuine public forums." Ashley Trim, a Pepperdine University administrator, agreed that an "employee town hall" is far from the original use of the "town hall" term. Still, Trim told us, it’s not uncommon for employers to have or host Q&A sessions and call them town halls. But University of Alabama political scientist Joe Smith commented: "Employees know that their employer has arranged for and endorsed the visit, and that therefore assertive questions are not welcome." Smith elaborated: "Since employees depend on these employers for their livelihoods, they are not likely to be fully candid in expressing their views. Also, attendees at this sort of gathering won’t feel able to bring up any topics they want to. Topics are likely to be limited to those related to the employer’s business area." Smith said he’d rate the CVA-hosted events and possibly three chamber of commerce town halls as more wide-open. Mark Rozell, a George Mason University dean, called the listed events mostly "quite different" from traditional open town halls held by members of Congress. "So it's apples and oranges here," Rozell said, adding: "The senator's office cannot just slap the label ‘town hall’ on site visits to factories and companies and then claim he's holding a lot of town halls. That's misleading." Rozell later agreed there persists "no precise, legal definition of what constitutes a town hall. So I suppose the senator, or any other member, can play word games and try to label any gathering of a group of people a ‘town hall’ in an attempt to rebut criticism for holding too few town halls. But it doesn't pass the common sense test to call a factory visit or selected audience event a ‘town hall.’" In contrast, Trim, who directs a Pepperdine public engagement institute, said Cruz’s use of the "town hall" term struck her as "valid within the common use of the term ‘town hall’ in 21st century America." After all, Trim reminded, town hall meetings have greatly evolved from their New England roots as community gatherings to set a hamlet’s course. Mark Jones, a Rice University political scientist, said Cruz’s claim fits a "minimalist" definition of town hall in that they involved the senator speaking to, and fielding questions from, constituents from all walks of life across the state. But for a town hall "maximalist," Jones wrote, none of Cruz’s events would qualify as a town hall "because they were held in largely controlled settings and were not open to the general public" with the exception of the veterans gatherings open to people registering ahead of time. John Gastil, a Penn State University professor, said that while the "town hall" term has lost clarity of definition over the years, he thinks Cruz’s claim was made to affirm his availability to the public. Gastil offered as keys to gauging the claim’s accuracy whether each event was open to the public and had an open agenda or one limited to a particular issue--and also whether members of the public at each event were allowed to speak and ask questions, with the senator proving responsive. Gastil conceded he didn’t have time to fact-check the entire Cruz-provided list of events. But on their face, he wrote, "only a few seem worth checking further. Events held by and at private corporations wouldn't count as a town hall. Those sponsored by nongovernmental organizations have a better prospect of being town halls (e.g., chambers of commerce), but you'd need to see affirmative evidence" that they were open to the public and had an open agenda. Cruz’s claim "strikes me as dubious," Gastil summed up. "Electeds do meet-and-greets with employees and other such things frequently, as part of their outreach, but it's disingenuous to call them ‘town halls.’" Our ruling Cruz, asked if he interacts enough with constituents, said: "In 2017, I’ve done 17 town halls" in Texas. The listed events Cruz attended from April through August 2017 demonstrate that the term ‘town hall’ can be stretched every which way, even to events not open to the public. All told, it looks to us like Cruz took questions at gatherings of selected constituents, mostly business employees--with the three veterans events open to members of the public who registered.

pomt-06298	Says President Barack Obama thinks Americans are lazy.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2011/nov/17/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-barack-obama-thinks-americans-are-/	In a 30-second television ad airing across the country, Texas Gov. Rick Perry lashes out at President Barack Obama by using the president's words. The ad, which debuted Nov. 16, 2011, opens with a video clip of Obama saying, "We've been a little bit lazy, I think, over the last couple of decades." Perry then appears, saying: "Can you believe that? That's what our president thinks is wrong with America? That Americans are lazy? That's pathetic." Perry made a similar claim a day earlier during an Iowa speech, according to the text of his remarks. Referring to the United States' economic troubles, Perry said: "In recent weeks, our president has taken to pointing the finger of blame instead of taking responsibility. He has called us soft and lazy." We'd heard the "soft" charge before. In an Oct. 14 speech unveiling his energy policy proposals, Perry said Obama "has labeled Americans as soft." We rated that statement, which amped up a statement Obama had made about the country getting soft in the past, Half True. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, a Perry rival for the Republican presidential nomination, has also accused Obama of calling Americans lazy. According to a Nov. 16, 2011, post on a MSNBC.com political blog, Romney said this while campaigning a day earlier in South Carolina: "Sometimes, I just don't think that President Obama understands America. I say that because this week — or was it last week — he said that Americans are lazy. I don't think that describes America." In his ad, Perry accuses Obama of thinking Americans are lazy. We can’t test what anyone, including Obama, is thinking. So, in this article, we're gauging whether Obama really indicated that he thinks Americans have been lazy. We traced Obama's comment to a question-and-answer session with the head of Boeing on Nov. 12, 2011, at a meeting of business leaders during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Honolulu. The conversation between Jim McNerney and Obama touched on the regional economy, world trade and what the president characterized as a "re-engagement" by the United States with Pacific Rim countries. Obama said that there is no area he considers more vital and that the United States wants to work with other Pacific Rim countries to "enhance job growth, economic growth, prosperity and security for all of us." "I think we spent a decade in which, understandably, after 9/11, we were very focused on security issues, particularly in the Middle East region," Obama said. "And those continue to be important. But we've turned our attention back to the Asia-Pacific region, and I think that it's paying off immediately in a whole range of improved relations with countries, and businesses are starting to see more opportunities as a consequence." The conversation soon turned to the complicated relationship that the United States has with China. Obama made his "lazy" comment in response to a question from McNerney about impediments that China might see to investing in the United States. "Well, this is an issue, generally," Obama said. "I think it's important to remember that the United States is still the largest recipient of foreign investment in the world. And there are a lot of things that make foreign investors see the U.S. as a great opportunity — our stability, our openness, our innovative free market culture. "But, you know, we’ve been a little bit lazy, I think, over the last couple of decades. We’ve kind of taken for granted — well, people will want to come here — and we aren’t out there hungry, selling America and trying to attract new business into America. And so one of the things that my administration has done is set up something called SelectUSA that organizes all the government agencies to work with state and local governments where they're seeking assistance from us, to go out there and make it easier for foreign investors to build a plant in the United States and put outstanding U.S. workers back to work in the United States of America." Two days later, a reporter asked White House spokesman Josh Earnest to explain what Obama meant by his "lazy" remark. Earnest said Obama "was making the case" that it's time for U.S. foreign policy to focus on the Asia-Pacific region because there's "an enormous economic opportunity" there. Earnest continued: "And so that is why the president has made this a focus of his foreign policy moving forward. I don't think that — it's the president's view that this region has not been the focus in recent history, and that's what the president was alluding to, that we are in a circumstance where we need to redouble our efforts to be engaged in this region." So where does that leave us? Partly pondering who Obama meant by "we." In the MSNBC.com blog post, Mark Murray, deputy political director for NBC News, says Obama "wasn't calling Americans lazy; rather, he was calling U.S. business practices to attract foreign investors lazy." Another possibility: Speaking with McNerney, Obama often used "we" to refer to the U.S. government or his administration. So the president may have been criticizing the federal government's efforts to help attract investment from abroad. After all, in his next sentence, Obama points to a Commerce Department website (SelectUSA) that says it "seeks to highlight the many advantages the United States offers as a location for business and investment." Our ruling: Obama said America had acted lazily in some regard. Exactly whom he considers lazy, we're still not sure. But it’s clear that he was not wagging his finger at the American public at large. Perry's presentation distorts the president's remark by taking it out of context. We rate his claim Mostly False.

pomt-04188	Says the Obama administration plans to ban all weapons for U.S. citizens through international treaties.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2012/dec/11/chain-email/chain-email-says-obama-administration-plans-use-in/	According to a chain email, President Barack Obama recently "took the first major step in a plan to ban all firearms in the United States." The email, sent to us by a curious Austin reader, continues: "The Obama administration intends to force gun control and a complete ban on all weapons for U.S. citizens through the signing of international treaties with foreign nations. By signing international treaties on gun control, the Obama administration can use the U.S. State Department to bypass the normal legislative process in Congress." Talk about an explosive agenda. Still, we launched into this look with skepticism since a similar fact-check boiled out to nothing but smoke. U.S. Senate hopeful Craig James drew a Pants on Fire in May 2012 after declaring that Obama and Hillary Clinton were seeking a treaty to ban the use of U.S. firearms. So we kept the matches handy. The recent chain email’s references to administration plans are presented as if they were part of an Oct. 14, 2009, Reuters news article headlined: "U.S. reverses stance on treaty to regulate arms trade." Datelined Washington, the actual article opens: "The United States reversed policy on Wednesday and said it would back launching talks on a treaty to regulate arms sales as long as the talks operated by consensus, a stance critics said gave every nation a veto. The decision, announced in a statement released by the U.S. State Department, overturns the position of former President George W. Bush's administration, which had opposed such a treaty on the grounds that national controls were better." In July 2012, the United States participated in the U.N. Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty, but the negotiations adjourned after four weeks amid a lack of consensus, according to a July 27, 2012, New York Times news article. The treaty cannot take effect unless every country signs off. The Times’ story says that major arms exporters — the United States, Russia and China — had said more time was needed before action. The story says, too, there was friction over whether the treaty would infringe on U.S. gun rights. Also, it says, 51 senators had urged the Obama administration not to sign the treaty — of significance considering U.S. ratification of any treaty would require 67 Senate votes. According to the story, the treaty would establish common international standards for authorizing international arms transfers. The newspaper said a draft version said a prime purpose is to "prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade in conventional arms and their diversion to illegal and unauthorized end use." It would also prohibit signatories from transferring conventional weapons that violate arms embargoes or enable those who commit genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, the story says. So, treaty gone? Not necessarily. On the day after Obama won re-election, the U.S. backed a U.N. committee’s call to renew debate over the treaty, Reuters reported in a Nov. 7, 2012, news article, adding that such a resolution is expected to clear the U.N. General Assembly, leading to a resumption of talks in March 2013. The story quotes an unidentified U.S. official as saying: "We seek a treaty that contributes to international security by fighting illicit arms trafficking and proliferation, protects the sovereign right of states to conduct legitimate arms trade, and meets the concerns that we have been articulating throughout. We will not accept any treaty that infringes on the constitutional rights of our citizens to bear arms," the official is quoted as saying. The story also says that "U.S. officials have acknowledged privately that the treaty under discussion would have no effect on domestic gun sales and ownership because it would apply only to exports." We’re not inclined to rely on comments by unidentified officials. In our James’ fact-check, though, we noted an April 16, 2012, speech to the Stimson Center in Washington by Thomas Countryman, an assistant secretary in the State Department’s Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation. Countryman summarized the administration’s goals for the arms trade treaty conference in part by saying provisions limiting domestic gun rights would not be embraced. "We will not support outcomes that would in any way infringe on the Second Amendment," Countryman said. "...This has been the position of the executive branch since 2009, and it remains our position today. We will not support or agree to any treaty that would do so. We believe that the international community can draft a treaty on international arms transfers that would both increase international security and still protect sovereign rights of nations. That is the treaty that the United States will pursue in July and for which we expect there will be widespread support." As we reviewed this chain email, Ewen Buchanan, spokesman for the U.N. Office for Disarmament Affairs, told us the treaty is intended to apply only to the international arms trade. The U.N. cannot regulate firearms within countries "on any ground whatsoever," Buchanan said. "It has no domestic jurisdiction." Buchanan also provided a June 2012 U.N. "Myths and Facts" handout that includes denials the body is contemplating a ban on gun ownership. "The U.N. is not pursuing a global treaty to ban gun ownership by civilians," the handout says. "Member states are committed to tightening controls over the international import, export and transfers of conventional arms, because without such controls it is easier for weapons to be diverted from the legal trade into the illegal market, and into the hands of terrorists, drug traffickers and criminal cartels." The handout also says: "Each sovereign state determines its own laws and regulations for the manufacture, sale and possession of firearms by its citizens. The United Nations has no jurisdiction over such matters... No UN agreement exists banning firearms possession." A July 27, 2012, draft of the treaty makes many references to restricting the international arms trade. As far as we could tell, it lacks provisions for the international community to regulate firearms within countries. Its preamble even notes the "legitimate trade and use of certain conventional arms ... for recreational, cultural, historical and sporting activities and lawful ownership where such ownership and use are permitted and protected by law." The preamble also affirms the sovereign right and responsibility of any country to "regulate and control transfers of conventional arms that take place exclusively within its territory, pursuant to its own legal or constitutional systems." Wayne LaPierre, chief executive of the National Rifle Association, expressed objections to the treaty to the United Nations on July 11, 2012, saying in testimony that the group would drop its opposition only if civilian firearms were not included. The draft treaty says it will apply to all conventional arms including battle tanks; armored combat vehicles; large-caliber artillery systems; combat aircraft; attack helicopters; warships; missiles and missile launchers; and small arms and light weapons. We called the association to explore how the Obama administration might use the treaty to ban all U.S. weapons and didn’t hear back. Our ruling The chain email says the administration plans to ban all weapons for U.S. citizens through international treaties. We found no evidence of such plans, instead consistent indications to the contrary. This chain email is also so off target, it’s ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

pomt-11329	Says "Eric Holder and his group came in and made" the Wisconsin Supreme Court race "highly partisan."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/apr/11/scott-walker/scott-walker-claim-eric-holder-making-supreme-cour/	Is Barack Obama’s attorney general, a possible candidate for president, to blame for making a pivotal Wisconsin Supreme Court campaign "highly partisan"? Republican Gov. Scott Walker raised the issue six days after Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Rebecca Dallet, who was backed by liberals, won election to the high court. Her win in the officially nonpartisan race raised hopes among Democrats of a "blue wave" of election victories, including denying Walker a third term in November 2018. Walker was interviewed April 9, 2018 by Jay Weber, a conservative talk show host on WISN-AM in Milwaukee. Referring to Dallet’s defeat of Michael Screnock, a Sauk County circuit judge backed by Walker and other conservatives, Walker said: Even Tuesday's election for the Supreme Court -- which, in the end, kind of boiled down to a ballot test between parties, even though it's supposedly nonpartisan, and that's really because Eric Holder and his group came in and made it highly partisan. Wisconsin Supreme Court races have seen partisan involvement in recent years, but the 2018 race set a new standard for partisanship. Let’s see if it was Holder -- the attorney general for most of Obama’s presidency, who is considering a run for president himself in 2020 -- who made the Supreme Court race "highly partisan." Holder’s involvement On March 15 and 16, 2018, Holder campaigned for Dallet in Milwaukee and Madison. At the time, he said the group he leads, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, was spending $140,000 on digital ads backing Dallet and that it might spend more. Later in the campaign, it was reported that Holder’s committee had spent a total of $165,000 to support Dallet. But on election night, the group said that it and its affiliates had "invested more than $500,000" to elect Dallet. (Note: In February 2018, Holder’s committee sued Walker over his refusal to call special elections to fill two open legislative seats. The suit successfully forced Walker to call the elections.) So, Holder himself and his group played a major role in backing Dallet. And it’s true that as national figures, Holder and his group added a national partisan dimension to the race. But the Wisconsin Republican Party played a major role in backing Screnock, starting before Holder did, and it doesn’t get much more partisan than a political party. First in -- the GOP Months before Holder’s involvement, Republican Party groups in Wisconsin started backing Screnock. For example, on Nov. 9, 2017, five months before election day, the Washington County Republican Party in suburban Milwaukee gave $500 to Screnock’s campaign. Later, other county parties, including those in Racine, Polk, Ozaukee, Sheboygan and Walworth counties, gave to Screnock’s campaign. On Feb. 8, 2018, the state GOP gave Screnock’s campaign a $31,152 in-kind donation. And five days later, Screnock’s campaign reported having received nearly $111,000 more from the GOP. On March 27, 2018, the state party announced a statewide radio, direct mail, digital, and billboard advertisement campaign attacking Dallet. In all, Screnock’s campaign received about $400,000 in help from the state and local Republican parties, the Associated Press reported. Our rating Walker says "Holder and his group came in and made" the Wisconsin Supreme Court race "highly partisan." Holder came to Wisconsin in March 2018, a few weeks before election day, to campaign for Dallet. And a group he leads said it and its affiliates spent more than $500,000 backing Dallet. That added a national partisan dimension to the campaign. But you can’t get any more partisan than a political party, and county Republican Party groups started backing Screnock months earlier, in November 2017. Ultimately, Republican Party groups, led by the state party, backed Screnock to the tune of some $400,000. For a statement that contains only some truth, we give Walker a Mostly False.

pomt-06206	"When the country was founded, Congress had exactly the same attitude about the sanctity of Christmas celebrations that a 7-Eleven does today: 'Yeah, we're open.'"	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2011/dec/09/jon-stewart/comic-jon-stewart-says-early-congress-met-most-chr/	The Rhode Island controversy over Gov. Lincoln Chafee's decision to call the decorated spruce tree in the State House rotunda a "holiday tree" instead of a "Christmas tree" spilled over to Jon Stewart's "The Daily Show" program on Dec. 6. During a segment on the "Tree Fighting Ceremony" that focused on Fox News' assertion that there is a culture war against Christmas, Stewart said, "Perhaps you'd prefer to celebrate Christmas the way our Founding Fathers did." Then he cut to a video clip from a documentary from the History channel cable network that stated: "On Dec. 25, 1789, the United States Congress sat in session and continued to stay open on Christmas Day for most of the next 67 years." "That's right," Steward added. "When the country was founded, Congress had exactly the same attitude about the sanctity of Christmas celebrations that a 7-Eleven does today. 'Yeah. We're open.'" We were intrigued by the idea that members of Congress in the early days would be on the job most Christmas Days, even if Dec. 25 fell on a weekend. So we started digging. As the program made clear, Stewart was quoting a History channel program, "Christmas Unwrapped - The History of Christmas." A Google search also brought us to an American Civil Liberties Union website on the "Origins of Christmas." It includes this quote: "Congress met on Christmas Day every year from 1789 to 1855, with only three exceptions." It lists the source as a 2007 article from the journal Word and World called "Christmas Was Not Always Like This: A Brief History" by Bruce David Forbes. The ACLU web page also references the History channel website, which says that "Christmas wasn't a holiday in early America—in fact Congress was in session on December 25, 1789, the country's first Christmas under the new constitution." We turned to Donald Ritchie, historian of the U.S. Senate. He had his doubts, saying that Congress typically took Christmas Day off. They didn't take a longer Christmas break, as they do now, because, in those days, traveling back to the home districts took too long. From there, we dug into the records. Our first discovery: the claim that "On Dec. 25, 1789, the United States Congress sat in session" is flat-out wrong. The web page "Dates of Sessions of the Congress, 1789-present" says that the last session of 1789 for both the House and the Senate was Sept. 29. By the time Christmas came around, Congress had been out of session for nearly three months. Both bodies reconvened on the first Monday in January 1790. The web page also shows that there were three years from 1789 to 1857 when Congress had a formal recess that extended over Christmas Day. But that doesn't mean they were on the job on Dec. 25 during all the remaining years. To find out, we went through the journals that were the predecessors of The Congressional Record. So how many times did the House and Senate meet on Christmas Day during the first 68 years of Congress? Once each. The Senate assembled and immediately adjourned on Christmas Day in 1797; the House met on Christmas in 1802. Our ruling Jon Stewart, ridiculing Fox News' coverage of the "War on Christmas," repeated a claim by the History channel that Congress met nearly every Christmas Day from 1789 to 1856. The ACLU makes the same claim, based on a magazine article. But daily records show the complete opposite, with just one exception each for the House and Senate. So the assertion that Congress met virtually every Christmas during that period is completely False. The idea that members would do so when there's a 1 in 7 chance that Dec. 25 would fall on a Sunday makes this idea ridiculous. So gather friends and family around the hearth as we give this Christmas claim by Stewart, the ACLU and the History channel a collective Pants On Fire! (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-13318	"It’s bad enough that (Stephen) Silberkraus appeared in a sexual fetish film where women were kidnapped from their homes and forced to live naked in kennels and trained to be pets. But when Silberkraus isn’t acting in films that degrade women, he’s stalking them in his personal time."	mostly false	/nevada/statements/2016/oct/06/lesley-cohen/nevada-assemblyman-accused-appearing-fetish-film-s/	Political attack ads typically stick to the same ol’ stuff, like voting records and candidate positions. That can’t be said for the jabs in Henderson, Nev., where voters in one state Assembly district are getting smacked with attacks on a pornographic level. Democratic Assembly candidate Lesley Cohen is spreading several campaign mail pieces accusing her opponent, incumbent Republican Stephen Silberkraus, of appearing in a "fetish film" and stalking women. "It’s bad enough that Silberkraus appeared in a sexual fetish film where women were kidnapped from their homes and forced to live naked in kennels and trained to be pets," it reads. "But when Silberkraus isn’t acting in films that degrade women, he’s stalking them in his personal time." It’s certainly not a standard political attack line, but is there any truth to it? Silberkraus did appear in a fetish film, but there’s more to it than the ad lets on — and the claim about stalking is even further from the truth. Film career Under the stage name of Stephen Neill, Silberkraus appeared as an extra in dozens of television shows, including The West Wing, Entourage, CSI, Power Rangers and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, with a film career spanning from the 1990s to the mid 2000s. The film cited in the mailer is called The Pet, a poorly received 2006 exploitation film based on the concepts of "human pets" and sexual slavery. "A young woman in dire financial straights accepts an offer to be a wealthy aristocrat's human ‘pet’ for six months," the plot summary reads. "Then ruthless modern ‘pet-nappers’ kidnap the woman to sell her on the GSM, " referring to the "Global Slave Market." Silberkraus appears briefly in the film as a trader on this market, and delivers a handful of lines in about 30 seconds of screen time. Reached by PolitiFact, the Republican Assemblyman said he was on set for one day to film his scene, and was at the time assuming that the film would be a more serious look at human trafficking. He called the finished product a "cheesy B-movie" and disparaged Cohen for propagating a "ridiculous political ploy" unrelated to the campaign. "An extra has about as much influence on a production as a fly has on growing a tree," he said. "They have no real say, they’re just there." Lynn Comella, a UNLV gender and sexuality studies professor, said use of the term "fetish film" seemed politically charged. Comella said in an email that she didn’t watch the film, but that the somewhat convoluted plot touched on a number of sexual fetishes and serious issues such as animal roleplay, human trafficking and organ harvesting. "I don't think it's necessarily wrong to describe it as a fetish film, but it's clear that this word is being used to pack a political punch," she said in an email. "It's clear that they are attempting to establish some kind of connection between this person's appearance in a fetish film — if we want to call it that — and stalking, which is specious at best." Stalking The campaign mail cites an article from NewsMaxTV Las Vegas, an online news site run by Republican political operative Rob Lauer. Lauer is known for an unsuccessful bid for Nevada secretary of state and having his home searched by police in 2015 as part of a wide-ranging extortion investigation into a Nevada Assemblyman. The article claims Silberkraus was detained by police in handcuffs for "stalking" his primary opponent. But Silberkraus was never charged with or convicted of stalking. Las Vegas police said they had no records on file for an arrest or any incident involving Silberkraus, and a search of national and local court document sites revealed nothing filed against Silberkraus. The stalking claim originates with three-time state Assembly candidate Amy Groves, who most recently lost a June 2016 Republican primary contest to Silberkraus by 253 votes. Groves told PolitiFact that she called police after seeing Silberkraus taking pictures of a home she owns outside the Assembly district where she had filed to run. Silberkraus said he was attempting to collect evidence that Groves lived in that home outside the district, which would disqualify her from running. A handful of legislative candidates have been removed from the ballot in recent years after their opponents were able to prove that they didn’t live in the district. Groves said she felt threatened because as a realtor, she was often responsible for evicting residents or overseeing collections, and said she felt threatened enough to call the police. "We really panicked because it’s a real threat in my industry," she said. Groves’ husband blocked in Silberkraus’ vehicle with his own car, and police questioned him for several minutes before letting him go. Silberkraus said he never felt like he was being detained, and that the photo in the ad was cropped to make it look like he was handcuffed. "I’ve never been handcuffed in my life," he said. Regardless, police have no arrest record or any record of Silberkraus being detained, and Groves said she didn’t keep copies of any paperwork she filed with police about the incident. Our ruling A campaign mailer in a competitive Nevada Assembly race accuses Silberkraus of appearing in a "sexual fetish film" and being detained for "stalking." Silberkraus did appear briefly as an extra in a 2006 movie that centered around a myriad of sexual fetishes. He says he doesn’t agree with the film’s message. The stalking allegation holds less water, stemming from a primary opponent who accused him of stalking her several years ago. No official record exists, and he was not arrested. The claim contains an element of truth but distorts facts to create an inaccurate impression. We rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a51c9421-8057-40d7-93e6-1b77fcca1f14	None	Lesley Cohen	None	None	None	2016-10-06T15:51:02	2016-09-24	['None']
pomt-12268	Says the manager of a Checkers in Miami Gardens, Fla., killed 10 employees.	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/jul/06/channel24newscom/story-about-checkers-shooting-came-fake-news-gener/	An online post that said the manager of a fast food restaurant killed 10 employees was created by a fake news generator apparently devised as a prank. An undated post on Channel24News.com under the headline, "Manager killed 10 employees at checkers on 183st and 27ave," is only two sentences long. The page’s source code said it was published on June 22, 2017. "10:30 pm last night police received a call about gun fire in Miami Gardens. Manager killed 10 employees because they was stealing money and tons of supplies," it read. It was illustrated with the photo of a Checkers restaurant at 2645 NW 183rd St in Miami Gardens, Fla., between Miami and Fort Lauderdale. Facebook users flagged the post as potentially being fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to fight fake news. As of this writing, the post was shared almost 2,700 times. The post is fake, because every post from Channel24News.com is fake. It’s a website designed to allow users to create their own stories, whether they are real or not (presumably not). You should be able to note that right away, thanks to the Yao Ming meme cartoon at the page header, accompanied by the words, "You Got Owned!" A note on the righthand side of the website reads, "You've Been Pranked! Now Create A Story & Trick Your Friends!" Clicking on the button allows a user to write a headline and body text, and upload a photograph to illustrate it. The site generates a url that people can then send to people in an effort to convince them it’s real. The site nominally advises people to be smart about what they create, noting in its footer, "We do NOT support FAKE NEWS!!! This is a Prank website that is intended for Fun. Bullying, Violent Threats or posts that Violate Public Order are NOT permitted on this Website." Of course, a "prank" about a shooting at a fast food restaurant is a bit on the violent side, but as of this writing the Checkers story had not been removed. The site is registered to a Korry Scherer in Milwaukee, Wis. We attempted to reach Scherer at the contact information provided (there’s none on the site) but didn’t hear back. We didn’t find a record of a mass shooting at a Miami Gardens Checkers, although a man was shot and killed at another location in the town in 2015.

pomt-12219	"We’ve signed more bills -- and I’m talking about through the legislature -- than any president ever."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/jul/20/donald-trump/donald-trump-not-close-claiming-he-has-signed-more/	On "Made in America Day," so proclaimed by President Donald Trump, the president hopped into the driver’s seat of a Wisconsin-made fire truck that was parked on the White House lawn. "Where’s the fire?" he joked. "Put it out fast." Products from all 50 states were showcased, including the truck made by Pierce Manufacturing in Appleton. During the July 17, 2017 ceremony, Trump made some remarks, including a claim about his productivity. Referring to Vice President Mike Pence, who was standing behind him, Trump said: In just a few months and moments, I will say what we’ve done over a short period of time and what we’re going to be doing over the next six months will be incredible. We’ve signed more bills -- and I’m talking about through the legislature -- than any president ever. For a while, Harry Truman had us, and now I think we have everybody, Mike. I better say "think," otherwise they’ll give me a Pinocchio -- (laughter) -- and I don’t like those -- I don’t like Pinocchios. The data In April 2017, at the 100-day mark of his presidency, Trump had signed 28 bills into law. That was the most since the 55 signed into law by Democratic President Harry Truman in 1949, after Truman was elected to his first full term. But, despite his claim on his 178th day in office, Trump is behind a number of presidents over the past several decades, according to GovTrack.us, a website that tracks Congress. President, party, year took office Bills signed into law through 178 days in office Dwight Eisenhower, R, 1953 228 John F. Kennedy, D, 1961 200 Jimmy Carter, D, 1977 70 Richard Nixon, R, 1969 64 George H.W. Bush, R, 1989 55 Bill Clinton, D, 1993 50 Donald Trump, R, 2017 42 Bills signed by Trump include one that’s meant to restore faith in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and several that roll back Obama-era regulations, including some that reverse rules on education, land use and federal purchasing. But it’s also worth noting that most of the laws with Trump’s signature are not major pieces of legislation, as PolitiFact National has reported. They include, among others: two federal spending bills of the sort required periodically of every president and Congress to keep the government running; a bill overhauling government-employee travel policy; a bill about the United States competing for an international expo; a measure addressing Department of Homeland Security vehicle fleets; and the official naming of a federal courthouse in Tennessee. (Trump’s Pinocchio reference, by the way, was to the rating system used by our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker.) Our rating Trump said: "We’ve signed more bills -- and I’m talking about through the legislature -- than any president ever." The 42 bills he had signed into law through 178 days in office trails the number signed by at least six other presidents at that point in their presidencies. We rate Trump’s statement False.

pomt-08947	"In Ohio, we invested in our children, raising school funding by 5.5 percent in the last budget."	false	/ohio/statements/2010/jul/23/ted-strickland/ted-stricklands-claim-about-increased-school-fundi/	Gov. Ted Strickland has long campaigned on being a champion of education, even going so far as to inject himself into the landmark school funding decision in Ohio back when he was a congressman. So it’s no surprise that the Democratic governor is peppering his campaign speeches with references to increasing school funding. For example, in a July 6, 2010, speech in Columbus, Strickland lamented funding cuts done in several other states before saying "in Ohio, we invested in our children, raising school funding by 5.5 percent in the last budget." The claim is such a popular theme with Strickland, we decided to look more closely at his assertion. While it’s true that the total pot of money going to funding primary and secondary schools in Ohio will grow by 5.5 percent during the current two-year state budget that ends in July 2011, it’s not state aid that is responsible for the hike. State aid to schools will actually be lower by about $32 million--from $6.542 billion in 2009 to $6.510 billion in 2011. On a district-by-district level, that means about 60 percent of the more than 600 school districts in Ohio will get less money for operations in the current two-year budget cycle than they did before. Instead, it’s federal money, including stimulus funding dollars which makes the statewide school funding pie bigger. And a large portion of the federal funding for primary and secondary education must be funneled into very specific programs such as $922 million statewide in combined federal Title I and IDEA funding. Title I money must be spent on things like additional teachers, intervention specialists for low-income students. IDEA funds must be spent on the education of special needs children. The natural impression left by the governor’s words "we invested in our children, increasing school funding" is that Ohio’s state government took steps to increase the amount it puts toward education. In fact, it was the federal government that has invested more in Ohio’s children. And six out of 10 Ohio schools districts have less money to spend on operations than they did in the previous budget under Strickland. We find the governor’s claim to be False. Comment on this item.

pomt-12309	Although California has "the sixth largest economy in the world, we also have one of the highest poverty rates" in the nation.	mostly true	/california/statements/2017/jun/22/antonio-villaraigosa/does-california-have-6th-largest-economy-world-and/	Before announcing his bid for California governor in November 2016, Antonio Villaraigosa said he went "up and down this state" on a listening tour. The former mayor of Los Angeles said he witnessed markers of the state’s economic vitality and also its extreme poverty. "What I saw was two Californias," Villaraigosa said at the forum, hosted on June 6, 2017 in San Francisco by the Public Policy Institute of California. Villaraigosa then made a statement that included two bold claims PolitiFact California has examined individually in the past. "What people don’t realize about California is that although we have the sixth largest economy in world, we have one of the highest poverty rates" in the nation, Villaraigosa said at the event. Villaraigosa makes his claim at about the 6:45 minute mark in this video by the Public Policy Institute of California. We’ll revisit our analysis on those claims below. First, here’s some background on Villaraigosa and the 2018 California governor’s race. Governor’s race Villaraigosa is among several prominent Democrats competing in 2018 to succeed Jerry Brown as governor. Others already announced include California Treasurer John Chiang; Delaine Eastin, the state’s former superintendent for public instruction; and Gavin Newsom, the state’s current lieutenant governor. Republican candidates include State Assemblyman Travis Allen of Orange County; John Cox, a venture capitalist from San Diego County and Rosie Grier, a Hall of Fame professional football player. A poll released in June 2017 showed a tightening race. Newsom was in the lead among all candidates, with 22 percent support from likely voters. Villaraigosa had 17 percent support, up from his 11 percent three months earlier. As part of our Tracking The Truth series, PolitiFact California is fact-checking claims in the 2018 governor’s race. Tracking the Truth: Hear a claim you want fact-checked? Email us at politifactca@capradio.org, tweet us @CAPolitiFact or contact us on Facebook. We’ve already checked one of Villaraigosa’s statements at the June 6, 2017 forum. He made the False claim that California is currently home to one-quarter of the nation’s 300 poorest cities. He mischaracterized the results of a study, which relied on data from 2013, when many of the state’s cities had not yet recovered from the Great Recession. Today, many of those same cities have experienced strong economic improvement. Sixth largest economy in the world? Turning to Villaraigosa’s bold claim involving the economy and poverty, we’ll start by checking the first part: that California has the "sixth largest economy in the world." This is a talking point California leaders love to make on national and international stages. We fact-checked this hypothetical comparison of the state’s economy against that of nations in July 2016 when State Senate Leader Kevin de León made the same assertion at the Democratic National Convention. We rated it Mostly True based on California’s 2.4 trillion GDP in 2015, which ranked sixth behind the United States, China, Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom and slightly above France and Brazil. The rankings came from the Brown Administration, which analyzed figures from the International Monetary Fund’s World Economic Outlook Database. The claim missed a completely True rating because it ignored California’s sky high cost of living and Silicon Valley’s outsized role in the state’s economic growth, which speaks to Villaraigosa’s description of unequal economies across the state. In a separate set of rankings, the California Legislative Analyst’s Office, adjusting for the state’s high cost of living, reported in 2016 that the state’s GDP ranking dropped to 11th in the world. That placed it just below France and just above Mexico. The Brown Administration, not including cost of living, recently updated the GDP rankings for 2016. California’s now $2.60 trillion GDP remained in the sixth spot, though it was just a tick behind the United Kingdom’s $2.62 trillion economy. Villaraigosa’s statement is accurate, but needs the same clarification about the state’s high cost of living. One of the highest poverty rates? The second part of Villaraigosa’s claim is that California has one of the "highest poverty rates." We interpreted this to mean compared with other states in the nation. We know the state has struggled mightily with poverty. As an example, we rated True a claim by Republican Assembly Leader Chad Mayes in January that California has "the highest poverty rate in the nation" when comparing states and considering cost-of-living. At 20.6 percent, California’s poverty rate in 2015 was well above the national average of 15.1 percent, according to a U.S. Census Bureau report that factors in cost-of-living. Florida’s 19 percent poverty rate ranked second. Unlike Mayes’ statement on poverty, however, Villaraigosa’s claim makes no mention of cost-of-living. Ignoring this factor, California would have the 17th highest poverty rate, not the first, according to the census bureau. Villaraigosa’s statement needs this key clarification. Our ruling Antonio Villaraigosa recently claimed California has "the sixth largest economy in the world" and one of the highest poverty rates" in the nation. The facts show Villaraigosa was correct on both points. He omitted, however, the key point that California’s high cost-of-living drags down its economic output and accelerates its poverty. The candidate for governor’s statements would benefit from this additional information. We rate Villaraigosa’s claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-08389	Lizbeth Benacquisto "broke election law 105 times, hiding special interest contributors."	true	/florida/statements/2010/oct/24/kevin-rader/florida-house-candidate-lizabeth-benaquist-accused/	It seems like every other ad on television is a campaign attack. It must be election season. One advertisement that caught our attention was a claim by District 27 state Senate candidate Kevin Rader against his Republican opponent Lizbeth Benacquisto. Rader beat Democratic opponent Pete Burkert by about 1,000 votes in the Aug. 24, 2010, primary election. Rader and Benacquisto are vying for the seat vacated by Dave Aronberg, who lost the Democratic primary for attorney general in August. The district runs from Republican-heavy Lee County through rural Glades and Hendry counties and into Democratic-heavy Palm Beach County. During a recent television ad, Rader attacks Benacquisto for 105 Florida election law violations. The advertisement, which features a picture of Benacquisto and mathematical symbols and equations, includes this: "Let’s do the math on Lizbeth Benacquisto. She broke election law 105 times, hiding special interest contributors. She claims she’s a tax cutter, but on city council, she repeatedly raised taxes and fees, totaling a 52 percent tax increase. One hundred five ethics violations; 52 percent tax increase. We can’t afford Lizbeth Benacquisto, or believe her." That seems like a large number of violations, so we wanted to put Rader’s claim to the Truth-O-Meter test. The source for the ad is a Palm Beach Post article published April 9, 2006, and written by Dwayne Robinson. The article focuses on Wellington village council members and their myriad mistakes in campaign record filings during the March 14, 2006, municipal election in Palm Beach County. Benacquisto was elected vice mayor with more than 56 percent of the vote over challengers Julio Galvez and Jean Lexima. The Rader ad focuses on an allegation against Benacquisto that in more than 105 instances, her reports excluded the occupations of donors giving more than $100 to her campaign. The article states many of those donors "were developers, builders, Big Sugar and other special interests." Florida law requires each report to contain the full name, address and occupation of anyone who has made a contribution, along with amount and date of such contribution. Mercedes Kelly, then Benacquisto’s campaign treasurer, told the Post she started including contributors’ occupations at the beginning of the campaign, but trailed off as the money came in. She admitted to being overwhelmed and said she would be filing an addendum with the complete information. According to 2006 campaign finance reports, Benacquisto filed addendums, writing by hand each person’s occupation for two filing periods, January through mid February and mid February through March. There were indeed builders and farmers, but also housewives, retirees and veterinarians. This was a situation where the same error was made 105 times, not 105 different types of errors. Still, Benacquisto had 108 contributors for 2006, so missing occupations on 105 of them meant nearly all her donors were not listed correctly. For a third filing period, in 2005 but part of the same election cycle, no addendum was filed. In that 2005 period, occupations weren’t listed for 53 of the 78 contributors. The 2006 article points out that during a 2002 village election, Benacquisto had no election law errors and fully reported donors’ occupations. Since the municipal election was four years ago and the omissions were publicized, we were curious how Benacquisto was doing this time. We looked at her filings for the 2010 Senate race. We found that of 673 contributions to Benacquisto so far this year, 150 times the occupation isn’t listed, according to information on the Florida Division of Elections website. In fairness, we’ll note that in Rader’s last report, for the period of Sept. 25 through Oct. 8, he also fails to list occupation 14 times among the 104 donors, according to the state Division of Elections website. Florida Election Commission Clerk Patsy Rushing said on Oct. 21 that no complaints have been filed against Benacquisto in this race. We’ll leave it up to you to determine whether there’s intent to leave off contributors’ names or just sloppiness by the campaign. But as for the truth of the matter, we rate Rader’s claim that Benacquisto "broke election law 105 times" as True.	None	Kevin Rader	None	None	None	2010-10-24T05:28:18	2010-10-20	['None']
pomt-12274	Since he and Scott Walker took office in 2011, "60,000 new jobs have been created in this state -- 40,000 of them were created in Madison and the Madison area."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/jul/05/paul-soglin/madison-mayor-understates-wisconsin-job-growth-ove/	While being interviewed about whether he will run against Gov. Scott Walker in 2018, Madison Mayor Paul Soglin seized on an issue that Walker has tried to own: jobs. Soglin, who served as Madison’s mayor twice before, dating back to the 1970s, began his third stint at City Hall in April 2011. Walker had taken office as governor in January of that year. On the June 18, 2017 edition of "Upfront with Mike Gousha," a talk show on WISN-TV in Milwaukee, Soglin contrasted himself with Walker on how best to create jobs. And he suggested Madison is responsible for most new jobs in the state, saying: I happen to believe that the public works in partnership and that means public investment. That’s what’s happened in Madison. We have invested in education, we have invested in infrastructure. That creates jobs. But more importantly, it creates private investment. And if you look at the Madison tax rolls, if you look at the population growth, if you look at the fact that when Governor Walker and I both took office in 2011, within three months of one another, 60,000 new jobs have been created in this state -- 40,000 of them were created in Madison and the Madison area. Clearly, we’re doing something right. And that’s not the state government or the university growing, because the governor’s cut those back. So, Soglin is referring to private-sector jobs. We wondered whether the 60,000 figure was accurate and whether Madison and the surrounding area created two-thirds of the new jobs in Wisconsin over the past seven years. Jobs, not labor force Soglin told us he based his claim on figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for the civilian labor force. But that’s not a count of jobs. The labor force is the number of people who are employed plus the number who are unemployed and looking for work. Other BLS figures show a much larger increase in jobs than Soglin claimed and that the Madison area does not account for two-thirds of them. The seasonally adjusted figures show there were 2,330,000 nonfarm private-sector jobs in Wisconsin in April 2011 and 2,539,900 jobs in May 2017, the latest figures available. That’s an increase of 209,900 jobs. For the Madison area, the seasonally adjusted figures are available only for total non-farm jobs -- meaning public and private sector jobs added together. There were 361,100 jobs in April 2011 and 401,900 in May 2017. That’s an increase of 40,800. But, again, that’s counting public sector and private sector jobs, when Soglin was citing only private sector jobs. So, the Madison area produced far less than two-thirds of the new private-sector jobs. As for the labor force, the measure Soglin cited, there were 3,062,326 people either employed or unemployed and looking for work in Wisconsin in April 2011. In May 2017, the figure was 3,136,701. (These figures are not seasonally adjusted.) That’s an increase of 74,375. The figures for the Madison area (April 2017 is the latest available) were 359,132 and 389,259, an increase of 30,127. That means the Madison area accounted for about 40 percent, not two-thirds, of the increase in the labor force. Our rating Soglin says that since he and Walker took office in 2011, "60,000 new jobs have been created in this state -- 40,000 of them were created in Madison and the Madison area." But Soglin was citing figures for the number of people in the labor force -- that is, people who are employed plus people who are unemployed but looking for jobs. That’s not a count of jobs. The actual net increase in jobs in Wisconsin, comparing April 2011 versus May 2017, is much higher: 209,900. And the Madison area accounted for less than half of the increase. We rate Soglin’s statement False.	None	Paul Soglin	None	None	None	2017-07-05T05:00:00	2017-06-18	['Madison,_Wisconsin', 'Scott_Walker_(politician)']
pomt-09655	The Senate health care bill does not contain limits on medical malpractice lawsuits.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/dec/02/mitch-mcconnell/mcconnell-gets-it-right-medical-malpractice-reform/	Republicans have a lot of concerns about the Senate health care bill, and one of their biggest is that it does not include any language to rein in lawsuits against doctors. On Day 2 of the chamber's health care debate, Republican leader Mitch McConnell spoke about the issue on the Senate floor as he encouraged colleagues to send the bill back to committees for some major changes. "Then we could start over and end junk lawsuits against doctors and hospitals that drive up costs, something the majority didn’t find any room for in their 2,074-page bill — not a word about controlling junk lawsuits against doctors and hospitals," McConnell said Dec. 1, 2009. That claim has been echoed by other conservatives, including Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer. Their argument for limiting malpractice cases or their awards — supporters call it "tort reform" — involves saving money. If doctors are not scared of being sued, they're less likely to order unnecessary tests and procedures for their patients, thus reducing medical costs. Indeed, a Congressional Budget Office report from 2004 says health care premiums have risen recently in part "because insurance companies have faced increased costs to pay for claims (from growth in malpractice awards)." More recently, the independent budget office said that medical malpractice reform could save up to $54 billion over the next 10 years. President Barack Obama addressed the issue at a June meeting of the American Medical Association, saying, "I recognize that it will be hard to make some of these changes if doctors feel like they're constantly looking over their shoulders for fear of lawsuits. ... I understand some doctors may feel the need to order more tests and treatments to avoid being legally vulnerable." Nevertheless, Obama said malpractice awards should not be capped, as many Republicans want, because he believes the caps can be unfair to people who are wrongfully harmed. Former Democratic National Committee chairman Howard Dean, a physician, gave some insight into the issue when it came up in a Virginia town hall meeting last summer. "Here's why tort reform is not in the bill: When you go to pass a really enormous bill like that the more stuff you put in it the more enemies you make," Dean said. "The reason tort reform is not in the bill is because the people who wrote it did not want to take on the trial lawyers in addition to everyone else they were taking on, and that is the plain and simple truth." So, Democrats have not included medical malpractice limits in either the House or Senate version of the bills. Instead, the administration has said it will give some states $3 million grants to test new approaches for limiting lawsuits. The two bills don't completely ignore the issue. The Senate bill includes nonbinding "sense of the Senate" language on page 1,858 that "states should be encouraged to develop and test alternatives to the existing civil litigation system as a way of improving patient safety, reducing medical errors, encouraging the efficient resolution of disputes ... while preserving an individual's right to seek redress in court." The House bill establishes an incentive for states to adopt alternatives to traditional malpractice lawsuits, but those proposals cannot include provisions to limit attorney fees or impose caps on damages. So, back to McConnell's claim. He said that the Senate bill does not include limits on medical malpractice litigation, and he is clearly correct. We rate his claim True.

pomt-02727	"There never really was a 'Hastert Rule.' "	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2013/dec/19/dennis-hastert/hastert-there-was-no-hastert-rule/	One of the guiding principles for Republicans in the House of Representatives is that no bill comes up for a vote unless a majority of Republican members support it. It’s called the "Hastert Rule," after former House Speaker Dennis Hastert who held the post from 1999 to 2007. The Hastert Rule got a lot of attention during the government shutdown. Democrats said the House could have broken the logjam sooner if they had been allowed to vote on a bill that would have pulled in about 30 Republican members. Current Speaker John Boehner would have none of it. But the namesake of the rule now says no rule, in fact, exists. "There never really was a 'Hastert Rule'," Hastert said Wedneday on MSNBC’s The Cycle. He said the "rule" was just a statement of common sense. "If you're a leader of the House and you need to go to the other side of the aisle to move your agenda, you give up a lot of power and leadership," Hastert said. "The real Hastert Rule (was) you didn't bring a bill to the floor unless you had 214 votes." We wanted to address two issues in this fact-check. Is there an actual rule? And if not, why is everyone acting like there is one? Donald Wolfensberger, who spent 28 years as a House staffer and now directs the Congress Project at the Wilson Center, said there is no official Hastert Rule. "It was neither a House rule nor a Republican conference rule, and certainly not a matter of law nor enforceable by point of order or caucus sanction," Wolfensberger said. "As Hastert put it, it is a commonsense rule of thumb." In fact, Boehner himself has deviated from the Hastert Rule without consequence. In January, the House passed $50.7 billion in federal aid for Hurricane Sandy victims with a majority of Republicans in opposition. A majority of Republicans also voted no on a January 2013 fiscal cliff deal that passed the House. The Hastert Rule, essentially, is popular shorthand for a tactic to prevent political embarrassment. In the rough and tumble of House politics, Wolfensberger said, the leader of the majority party would be naive to count on help from the minority to get a bill passed. "It may be hard to believe but the minority sometimes takes delight in leaving the majority high and wet on the losing end of a vote on a matter that was supposed to have had bipartisan support," Wolfensberger said. Its origins likely stem from the GOP takeover of the House in 1995, said Linda Fowler, professor of government at Dartmouth College. Before then, Republicans had not controlled the House since President Dwight Eisenhower was in office. "Old-style Republicans had been in the minority so long, they worked with the majority on the theory that part of a loaf was better than nothing," Fowler said. "Gingrich and others like him were scornful of such accommodation." Hastert says the term that bears his name originiated during a contentious vote on immigration policy in 2006. A reporter asked him why he wouldn’t move forward with help from Democrats. "You don't really want to move anything unless you have the solid base of your party along with you," Hastert explained. Chicago Sun Times Washington bureau chief Lynn Sweet tracked it back to a 2003 speech by Hastert where he outlined his guidelines as speaker. "My fifth principle is to please the majority of your majority," Hastert said. As Hastert said on MSNBC, it was all about holding on to power within his own party. A rule without a capital R The record is clear that the principle known as the Hastert Rule never had any formal standing. But the record is full of moments when politicians, staffers and journalists used the phrase. In March, Rep. David Schweikert, R- Ariz., urged his colleagues to "honor the Hastert Rule and bring bills to the floor that enjoy majority support among our conference." In September, a spokesman for Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D- Ill., said "The Hastert Rule basically means that 118 Republicans have to agree on immigration reform before the whole House can consider it." A Nexis search produced nearly 100 references to the Hastert Rule in newspapers since 2004. According to Nexis, the first instance was in November 2004 when Los Angeles Times reporter Richard Brownstein wrote about Hastert: "One of his guiding principles has been that no bill should pass the House unless it has support not only from an overall majority but from a majority of Republicans. Call it the Hastert Rule." An interesting, but worthwhile aside. For a brief time, members of Congress referred to a different "Hastert Rule." In May 2004, we found instances of people talking about the Hastert Rule in terms of members of Congress being able to raise the nation’s debt ceiling without voting on a standalone measure (the idea being to make life easier for members of Congress). The mechanism had been called the Gephardt Rule after former Rep. Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo., but when Hastert became speaker, Democrats changed the "rule’s" name. Our ruling Hastert said there never was a Hastert Rule. As a formal rule, adopted by the Republican Conference or the House Rules Committee, that is accurate. Boehner himself broke the Hastert rule at least twice in 2013 and suffered no consequences. Yet, the Hastert Rule has become shorthand for a belief popular among Republicans that has no-doubt shaped GOP policy in the past and present. And Boehner could face consequences from his Republican caucus if he continued to violate the rule -- namely losing his speakership. In that sense, the Hastert Rule has become a little akin to common law among the GOP. Hastert has a technical point but glosses over some important caveats. We rate his claim Half True.

pomt-03341	"We’re importing about 10 percent of our milk supply. We’re America’s Dairyland, but yet we don’t have enough milk in this state to meet the demand for our cheesemakers."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jul/21/scott-walker/americas-dairyland-needs-import-10-its-milk-gov-sc/	For two decades, America’s Dairyland has suffered the indignity of being outmilked by, sheesh, California. Now comes word that our cows don’t even produce enough milk for Wisconsin -- more needs to be brought in from other states. The Badger State, since being eclipsed by California in milk production in 1993, has had time to cope with being No. 2. But Bucky apparently still wants to fight. On July 10, 2013, Gov. Scott Walker spoke to reporters in Dallas, Wis. (pop. 409), at Wisconsin Farm Technology Days, which is billed as one of the largest agricultural shows in the nation. He said it is important that Wisconsin dairy farmers increase milk production to meet the demands of the state’s dairy plants. "A lot of people don’t realize that we’re importing about 10 percent of our milk supply," Walker said, according to The Country Today, a newspaper that covers rural life in Wisconsin and Minnesota. "We’re America’s Dairyland, but yet we don’t have enough milk in this state to meet the demand for our cheesemakers." Do we really have to import about 10 percent of our milk? Walker’s evidence At the ag show, Walker talked up the state agriculture department's 30X20 program, which gives grants of up to $5,000 to dairy producers toward a goal of generating 30 billion pounds of milk per year statewide by 2020. Walker spokesman Tom Evenson said the governor based his claim on hard numbers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, as well as two assumptions. As we'll see, the government does not track milk "imports," or rather the shipment of milk across state lines. So, the two assumptions Walker makes are critical in evaluating his statement. Figures from the USDA show Wisconsin produced 27.2 billion pounds of milk in 2012. (That was up 4 percent from 2011 and is a record for Wisconsin, according to the USDA.) From there, Walker does some calculations. He assumes, as it is widely held in dairy circles, that 90 percent of milk produced in Wisconsin is used to make cheese, as opposed to being bottled or used to make foods such as ice cream and yogurt. That would mean 24.5 billion pounds of Wisconsin milk was available for cheese making. Walker's other assumption is a rule of thumb -- cited by Wisconsin cheese industry folks and others, such as Harvard University -- that it takes about 10 pounds of milk to make one pound of cheese. So, dividing the 24.5 billion pounds of milk by 10 would mean there was enough Wisconsin milk to make 2.45 billion pounds of cheese in 2012. But federal figures show Wisconsin actually produced more than that -- 2.79 billion pounds of cheese (tops in the United States). That's a difference of 340 million pounds of cheese. Put another way, it would mean Wisconsin cheese makers needed to import 3.4 billion pounds of milk to produce all of the cheese they made in 2012. And 3.4 billion pounds of milk amounts to 12.5 percent of the 27.2 billion total pounds of milk produced in Wisconsin in 2012. So, by Walker's figuring, his 10 percent claim is actually conservative. That's a start. Let’s hear from some experts. Other evidence John Umhoefer, executive director of the Wisconsin Cheese Makers Association in Madison, cited slightly older federal figures, from 2011, which he said comprise the latest complete data-set available. He also used the two assumptions Walker did. Wisconsin produced 26.1 billion pounds of milk in 2011 -- which, using the 10-pound rule of thumb, was enough for about 2.61 billion pounds of cheese. But Wisconsin cheese makers actually made 2.64 billion pounds of cheese in 2011. So, using round numbers, if 90 percent of Wisconsin milk gets used for cheese, but cheese making accounts for all of the Wisconsin milk produced (and a little more), that means there's at least a 10 percent milk shortfall. That additional milk had to come from some other state, if it didn’t come from Wisconsin. James Robson, chief executive officer of the Wisconsin Milk Marketing Board, which works to increase the sale and consumption of Wisconsin milk and dairy products, told us Wisconsin has had a milk production shortfall for all 12 years that he has headed the Madison-based board. He said the efficiency of Wisconsin milk production has increased the past several years, but that consumers' demand for cheese has increased even more, creating the need for milk from out of state. (Wisconsin’s more than 1.2 million dairy cows produced 21,436 pounds of milk per cow in 2012, up 4 percent from 2011.) "Some of our cheese makers bring in milk from as far away as Texas," Robson said. He is also relying, however, on the two key assumptions Walker made. What about those? Ed Jesse, an emeritus agricultural and applied economics professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said the first thing to know about milk shortfalls or imports is that the government does not track the shipment of milk between states. So, any statement about the amount of milk brought into Wisconsin is an estimate. As for the two assumptions, Jesse said they have long been widely quoted and he doesn't necessarily argue with them, but that they aren't rock-solid, either. It takes 10 pounds of milk to make one pound of some cheeses, but less milk for others. And while it's often said 90 percent of Wisconsin milk is used for cheese making, that could be a "rural myth" but "it’s probably not far off," Jesse said. Indeed, even the Milk Marketing Board hedges a bit, saying "as much as" 90 percent of Wisconsin milk is made into cheese. Our rating Walker said: "We’re importing about 10 percent of our milk supply. We’re America’s Dairyland, but yet we don’t have enough milk in this state to meet the demand for our cheesemakers." Walker's statement is on target, based on the best available estimates, but there aren't actual statistics on how much milk is shipped to Wisconsin from out of state. With that clarification, we rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2013-07-21T20:08:14	2013-07-10	['None']
pomt-04316	Says New Jersey lost private-sector jobs between 2000 and 2009 because Democrats increased taxes, fees, regulations and state spending.	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/oct/29/chris-christie/chris-christie-says-democrats-are-blame-private-se/	Just in time for Halloween, Gov. Chris Christie cautioned New Hampshire voters last week to avoid the "horror movie" that New Jerseyans have lived through. Here’s how the Republican governor summed up that film’s plot: Democrats increased taxes, fees, regulations and state spending, leading the Garden State to lose private-sector jobs between 2000 and 2009. "See, look at what happened to us. From 2000 to 2009, we had a jobless decade: more private-sector jobs in New Jersey on Jan. 1, 2000 than were there on Dec. 31, 2009," Christie said Wednesday at a campaign event for Ovide Lamontagne, the Republican candidate for governor of the Granite State. "A jobless decade under Democratic leadership, because what did they do?" the governor went on. "Raise taxes, increase regulation, raised fees, and during that period of time, spending went up an average of 16 percent a year." The governor’s right about the drop in private-sector jobs, but he’s wrong to attribute that reduction only to tax and fee hikes, regulatory changes and state spending increases. Christie failed to note the impact of the recession, which coincided with the deepest losses of private-sector jobs. Christie spokesman Kevin Roberts told us "the Governor’s comments are factual and the record of job loss AND economic malaise in the decade dominated by Democratic leaders, who raises taxes, fees and burdensome regulation, speaks for itself." First, let’s break down the job figures. According to seasonally adjusted figures from the state Department of Labor and Workforce Development, the state had 3,366,100 private-sector jobs in December 1999 and 3,211,100 in December 2009. That represents a net loss of 155,000 private-sector jobs over the decade. During the same time period, New Jersey gained 69,300 net jobs in the public-sector. But the bulk of the private-sector job losses occurred in 2008 and 2009 -- the height of the recession. The recession technically lasted from December 2007 to June 2009, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. After five consecutive years of private-sector job gains, New Jersey lost 107,900 jobs in 2008 and 117,000 in 2009. Harry Holzer, a professor at the Georgetown Public Policy Institute and the chief economist for the U.S. Department of Labor under President Bill Clinton, called Christie’s comparison "extremely unfair." "It's an extremely unfair comparison, since Jan. 1 2000 was the peak of the late-90s boom and Dec. 31 2009 was close to the trough of a terrible recession," Holzer said in an e-mail. "There is no question that the recession contributed, and is likely the dominant effect," Holzer added. "When you go from the strongest labor market in the past 40 years to the weakest one in 80 years, there will be a lot of job loss, and that was true in every state in the country." But Joseph Seneca, a professor at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, told us another factor was how New Jersey’s private-sector job gains preceding the recession lagged behind the nation’s growth rate. "The reasons for that weak performance compared are complex, but they include the loss of competitiveness of the state in terms of attracting, retaining and growing private sector investment and employment," Seneca said in an e-mail. "How much of this loss in competitiveness was due to taxes, regulations, other business costs, and a perceived unfriendly business climate cannot be easily determined, but by the mid years of the decade this deterioration in competitiveness had manifested itself in weak job growth." Our ruling At a campaign event in New Hampshire last week, Christie claimed New Jersey lost private-sector jobs between 2000 and 2009 because Democrats increased taxes, fees, regulations and state spending. The governor’s right about the drop in private-sector jobs: New Jersey lost 155,000 jobs between December 1999 and December 2009. But the reasons behind those job losses are complex and Christie failed to acknowledge the impact of the recession, which coincided with the bulk of the job losses. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-09959	The Democrats propose "a government-controlled health care plan that will deprive roughly 120 million Americans of their current health care coverage."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/19/mike-pence/120-million-deprived-health-care-not-correct/	With high-profile support from President Barack Obama, Congress is preparing a major overhaul of the nation's health care system. The details have yet to be revealed, but that hasn't stopped critics in Congress from going on the attack. Obama and the Democratic leadership have proposed broad outlines for the overhaul. The centerpiece of their plan remains the employer-based system, where most people have private health insurance through work. To rein in costs, the government would invest in electronic medical records and encourage efficiency and preventive care. To get coverage for people who don't have health insurance, the plan would increase eligibility for the poor and children to enroll in initiatives like Medicaid and the State Children’s Health Insurance Program. Finally, the plans seek to create a health insurance exchange, where individuals and small businesses can easily comparison shop for insurance coverage. One of the exchange plans would be a public option run by the government. It's the public option that has fueled Republican attacks, leading to charges that it would destroy the private system, that millions would lose their current coverage, and that Democrats don't have a way to pay for it. Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana described the Democratic health care plan as "a government-controlled health care plan that will deprive roughly 120 million Americans of their current health care coverage and lead to federal bureaucrats denying critical care for patients." That "120 million" number jumped out at us. That's a big number, representing roughly three-quarters of those who now have employer-provided health insurance. We asked Pence's staff about the number, and they referred us to a report from the Lewin Group, a health care consulting firm. The report ran a number of scenarios, including what would happen if the government offered a public option that was a Medicare-style plan open to everyone. Their model found that 118 million people would choose to drop their private coverage in favor of cheaper public coverage. But there's a hitch: That's what the Lewin Group believed would happen under the plans that were the most like Medicare, and if everyone were allowed to enroll. As we noted before, it's possible to set up a public option where only some people are allowed to enroll. Under the Lewin Group's estimates, if you restrict a Medicare-style public option only to individuals and small businesses, only 32 million would leave private coverage. And if the public option is less like Medicare and competes like a private insurer, the number drops further. We'll grant that Congress could come up with a Medicare-style plan and open it to everyone, but it doesn't seem likely. Pence appears to be picking the worst number he can choose. And he doesn't mention the fact that under the scenario laid out by the Lewin Group, people would still have health care coverage and their premiums reduced by 30 to 40 percent. He says the government would "deprive" people of health insurance, when actually the scenario is that they would choose a different option. Even if you believe that an expansive government health care plan would drive private insurers out of business, that still doesn't account for Pence's "deprive" claim, because the Lewin report he cites is focused on people who have chosen the government plan, not people who were left to the government plan after private options disappeared. Finally, we have to include a caveat about the Lewin Group. The group says it operates with editorial independence, but it is a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, which also offers private health insurance. Given all this background and explanation, we rated Pence's statement that the government would "deprive" 120 million people of their "current health care coverage" False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d3dff281-ba69-4fa7-b09c-de38ed52a748	None	Mike Pence	None	None	None	2009-05-19T18:34:44	2009-05-12	['United_States', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-00421	"It appears that the (Jacksonville) shooter was part of the Trump 'Resistance'."	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/aug/28/rush-limbaugh/rush-limbaugh-falsely-claims-jacksonville-shooter-/	In an attempt to find a motive behind a deadly shooting at a video game tournament in Jacksonville, Fla., some conservative commentators misidentified the assailant as part of a political opposition movement against President Donald Trump. Syndicated talk show radio host Rush Limbaugh went a step further, predicting the story would quickly vanish from headlines because the mainstream media is wary of publicizing stories in which "the resistance is taking up arms" "I’m thinking you might not hear very much about this Jacksonville shooting after the preliminaries because it appears that the shooter was part of the Trump 'Resistance'," Limbaugh said Aug. 28, two days after two died and 10 others were injured in the incident. But Limbaugh’s claim is based on erroneous reporting, which has since been retracted. Gateway Pundit identifies wrong Reddit user Limbaugh’s comments were posted on his website, which linked to a story on the conspiracy-minded site Gateway Pundit. The original headline on the Gateway Pundit article read, "Jacksonville Shooter Was Member of Anti-Trump ‘Resistance’ – Referred to Trump Supporters at ‘Trumptards’ – Murdered 4 People." Gateway Pundit identified the shooter as operating with the Reddit handle "Ravenchamps," which posted comments critical of Trump and his supporters. However, the actual shooter’s video game handle was "Ravens2012champs," according to NBC News. TMZ reported he also used the name "RavensChamp" — one letter off from the user identified by Gateway Pundit. Gateway Pundit has since removed references to the wrongly identified Reddit user, and issued an update that says, "An anonymous Reddit user was mis-identified in an earlier post." The Gateway Pundit article now carries a different headline that strikes any reference to the shooter’s political leanings: "Jacksonville Shooter Had Strange Online Profile and Bizarre Playing Style – Murdered 3 People (UPDATE)." We searched through articles about the perpetrator and found no evidence the shooting was politically motivated. At the time of this writing, the post on Limbaugh’s site remains uncorrected. Attempts to reach Limbaugh were unreturned. In an interview with NBC News, the wrongly identified Reddit user, who NBC referred to only as a Minnesota native named "Pavel" to protect his privacy, described his reaction to learning about the case of mistaken identity: "I went on Reddit. I noticed I had 60, 70 unread messages. Usually I have two or something," he told NBC News. "I look at the messages and it's a bunch of people using my username claiming I'm that Madden shooter person. Half of them are messages like 'I hope that person's dead.' Responding to a user who said "ravenchamps was his profile, see for yourself," Ravenchamps wrote back. "I'm alive you know?" he wrote. Our ruling Limbaugh said, "It appears that the (Jacksonville) shooter was part of the Trump 'Resistance'." Limbaugh’s comments were based on an article by the Gateway Pundit, which has since retracted its claim about the shooter’s anti-Trump political leanings. We searched through articles about the perpetrator and found no evidence the shooting was politically motivated. We rate this claim False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that per NBC News, the shooter used the handle "Ravens2012champs" as a video game username, not a Reddit username.

pomt-05030	Says she "stood up to" Gov. Scott Walker on tax cuts "for wealthy corporations" while her congressional opponent voted with Walker.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jul/13/kelda-helen-roys/roys-says-pocan-voted-walker-favor-tax-cuts-wealth/	State Reps. Kelda Helen Roys and Mark Pocan united against Gov. Scott Walker’s collective bargaining limits in 2011, but competition for a big promotion is creating friction between the two Madison Democrats. The two are seeking the Madison-area 2nd Congressional District seat, which is open because U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin is running for the U.S. Senate. The all-important primary in the heavily Democratic district is Aug. 14, 2012. In the race, Roys is tagging Pocan as "caving" by voting with Walker on two pro-business bills. In pointed remarks at a July 9, 2012 news conference, Roys riffed about Walker’s "outrageous" series of "corporate tax giveaways for wealthy corporations -- some of them out of state." She said the Republican governor’s intent was to help his "deep pocketed friends." Then she went after Pocan. "Were we going to vote for Walker’s corporate tax giveaways or were we going to do the right thing for working families that need and rely on the public services we provide?" Roys asked. "On those votes, when it really mattered, Mark Pocan failed the judgment test by voting for Walker’s corporate tax giveaways." In a district that strongly opposed Walker in the failed June 2012 recall election, those are fighting words. Did Pocan help Walker deliver tax breaks for "wealthy corporations"? Roys singled Pocan out for votes on two bills in the January 2011 special session. She repeated the charge in a new TV ad, though without narrowing it to two bills, and without naming Pocan. --Assembly Bill 3, which wiped away two years of taxes for businesses that relocate to Wisconsin. Estimated price tag in lost tax revenue for the state treasury over two years: $1 million over two years. --Assembly Bill 4, which expanded the Economic Development Tax Credit program by $25 million, bringing it to $98.1 million. The credit can go to businesses that locate or retain corporate headquarters in Wisconsin, create jobs, make capital investments or train workers, the Journal Sentinel reported. Pocan did vote with the Republicans on both bills. But both bills attracted major support from Democrats in the Assembly, passing with 82-12 majorities. In other words, Pocan joined about two-thirds of the Democratic caucus in the Assembly in voting "yes." Roys was opposed, decrying aid to out-of-state firms while existing businesses paid full freight, and calling the Economic Development Tax Credit expansion unnecessary. She said she thinks Pocan "caved" because "people want to give Walker the benefit of the doubt and don’t want to be tagged as anti jobs." Pocan, a small business owner, defends the bills as modest efforts of the kind that Roys herself has supported in the past -- as she did in 2009 under Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, when Pocan was co-chair of the Legislature’s budget-writing committee. Pocan also noted the bills had minimal impact on the state’s 2011-’13 deficit. At the time of the vote, fiscal analysts predicted that none of the $25 million in additional tax credits would be claimed during the two years, because the fund was flush, as we noted in an earlier item. The other bill had a $1 million price tag over the two years. What about the other bills in the special session? Roys specified two, but also referred to a "series." Roys did not mention the biggest tax-break bill in that session: Assembly Bill 7, a much modified version of Walker’s push to give small businesses a tax break. In the end, the bill gave both mom-and-pop businesses and large corporations an estimated collective income tax break of $33.5 million a year -- tied to how many jobs they create. It passed 60-33 in the Assembly, with only three Democrats joining the GOP majority. Pocan did buck Walker on that one, as did Roys. Finally, Roys said the two were aimed at helping "wealthy corporations." But neither tax credit program is limited to larger businesses. Our rating Roys said Pocan caved by supporting Walker’s tax breaks "for wealthy corporations" while she stood in opposition. Pocan did vote for two bills that potentially could help large corporations cut their tax bills, so she is partially on target. But she leaves out important details that change the picture. Pocan opposed a much bigger-ticket tax break bill in the same session, and the two he backed helped small businesses as well as large corporations. What’s more, two-thirds of Democrats in the Assembly backed the bills -- and Roys herself is a past supporter of one of the programs. We rate her claim Half True.

pomt-04372	Says House Democrats "voted to use your tax dollars for abortions" by voting against bill defunding Planned Parenthood.	false	/tennessee/statements/2012/oct/21/tennessee-republican-party/tennessee-gop-claims-tax-dollars-abortions-support/	Animosity between Planned Parenthood and anti-abortion activists has spilled over into Tennessee politics for years during an ongoing dispute over the use of federal funds, distributed by the state Department of Health, to pay for providing women's health services in the state's two largest counties. In the current campaign season, the Tennessee Republican Party has reached back to a 2009 state House vote on the so-called "defunding" of Planned Parenthood, targeting Democrats who voted against Republican-sponsored measure, in direct-mail advertising attacks. A mailer directed at former state Rep. Eddie Yokley, D-Greeneville, provides perhaps the strongest example. "Did you know Eddie Yokley voted to use your tax dollars for abortions?" the mailer asks in a large headline. The question is answered with another line saying the Democrat "supported taxpayer funded abortions" and an arrow pointing to a copy of a House roll call vote June 17, 2009, on HB1756 with Yokley's name circled on the list of 'no' votes. The state Democratic Party cried foul over this, declaring the mailer claim "shameless." Brandon Puttbrese, the Democrats' communication director, pointed out that state law forbids use of taxpayer dollars to fund abortions and that the funds in question are not used for abortions. A Republican rejoinder came from Adam Nickas, executive director of the state GOP: "Eddie Yokley had an opportunity to vote to defund Planned Parenthood, the nation's largest provider of abortions, but chose not to," Nickas said in an email. "We're not surprised Eddie Yokley is trying to squirm his way out of this one. We stand by our statement." The bill in question, HB1756, deals with what are known as federal "Title X" funds, distributed to states for "family planning services," including contraception, annual exams, Pap tests, screening for sexually transmitted disease and the like. As amended before passage, the bill did not go as far as anti-abortion activists wanted and basically called for the commissioner of health to give preference to county health departments as recipients of the funds over contracting the services out, which is how Planned Parenthood received the money in Shelby and Davidson counties. The Title X funds, then, do not go directly to fund abortions. There's no real dispute about that. The argument comes with contentions that the money indirectly supports Planned Parenthood's abortion services, which the organization contends are completely separate. Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey, for example, has called the funding "a pro-abortion shell game." He and others say putting money into one Planned Parenthood program, women's health services, frees up money for other services. It's worth nothing that the wording is toned down somewhat in other GOP mailings. For example, a mailer attacking Rep. Charles Curtiss, D-Sparta, puts it this way: "Charlie Curtiss voted to send our tax dollars to the largest abortion provider in America." Further, a follow-up Republican attack mailer aimed at Yokley, has this wording: "Eddie Yokley supported Planned Parenthood and opposed a measure that would have prevented them from receiving your tax dollars." In any case, the bill, which was in a milder form than subsequent years’ versions and had no real impact on funding of Planned Parenthood, did not involve funding of abortions – certainly not any direct taxpayer payments for them. Without getting into all the developments on this issue since that 2009 vote, we would note the distinction between Planned Parenthood's many services not related to abortion and its well-known role as an abortion provider was a key part of a 2011 battle in Shelby County over Title X funding. The Shelby County Commission ultimately voted – in accord with the 2011 version of defunding legislation – to take funding away from Planned Parenthood and instead have Christ Community Health Services provide family-planning services to low-income citizens. In the process, abortion opponents also argued that giving Planned Parenthood money for any purpose frees up other funds and indirectly supports abortions. Our ruling A Tennessee Republican Party mailer claims that by voting against a 2009 bill aimed at defunding Planned Parenthood, Democrats were in effect allowing tax dollars to be used directly for abortions. That goes further than even current mainstream Republican dogma that allowing any funding of Planned Parenthood’s family-planning and women’s health initiatives helps indirectly fund abortions. Voting against the 2009 bill did not, in fact, allow for taxpayer funds to be used for abortions, and we therefore rule the claim False.

pomt-15131	" 'Denali' is the Kenyan word for 'black power.' "	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2015/sep/03/viral-image/no-denali-not-kenyan-word-black-power/	Critics of President Barack Obama’s decision to drop President William McKinley as the namesake of America’s tallest mountain say the move is insulting to a great president from Ohio. Anonymous social media critics point to a more hidden motive in the mountain’s new name, Denali. One image circulating on Facebook accused the president of reaching back to his Kenyan roots for inspiration, claiming that " ‘Denali’ is the Kenyan word for ‘black power.’ " The meme’s claim is so ridiculous that you wonder if it’s just a bad joke. To start, "Kenyan" is not a language. The two official languages of Kenya are English and Swahili. Neither of those languages are exclusive to one country, as Swahili is also spoken in a number of different African nations. A search of multiple Swahili dictionaries turned up no results for the word "Denali." As our fact-checker friends at Snopes found, the Swahili word for "black" is "mweusi," and the Swahili word for power is "nguvu." That doesn’t amount to "Denali," which has roots in the word "Deenaalee" in Koyukon, a native language of Alaska currently spoken by just 300 people. Koyukon is part of the Athabaskan language family, which also includes Navajo and several Apache languages native to the American Southwest. "Deenaalee" approximately translates to "the High One," according to James Fall, an official at Alaska’s Department of Fish and Game, and James Kari, a linguist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks’ Native Language Center. Obama called the name change "a step to reflect the heritage of Alaska Natives." While the meme’s claim is ridiculous, we were able to verify that the viral image does depict the real Denali. Our ruling The meme claims " ‘Denali’ is the Kenyan word for ‘black power.’ " Nope. The word "Denali" doesn’t show up in Swahili, one of Kenya’s two national languages. Instead, it’s Koyukon Athabaskan for "high" or "tall."

pomt-07148	Then-Sen. Barack Obama "refused to raise the debt ceiling because he said President Bush had failed in leadership."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/14/michele-bachmann/bachmann-said-obama-voted-against-debt-limit-when-/	Michele Bachmann said she would not support increasing the debt ceiling if it didn't include major reductions in government spending. "I've already voted no on raising the debt ceiling in the past. And unless there are serious cuts, I can't," she said at debate June 13, 2011, in New Hampshire. Bachmann is seeking the 2012 Republican nomination for president. "But I want to speak to someone that's far more eloquent than I," she continued. "Someone who said just dealing with the issue of raising the debt ceiling is a failure of leadership. That person was then Senator Barack Obama. He refused to raise the debt ceiling because he said President Bush had failed in leadership." We decided to fact-check Bachmann's to see if she was right. We should point out that a vote to increase the debt limit doesn't increase spending directly. The spending was already authorized by other legislation, and now the U.S. Treasury Department needs a formal signoff to keep issuing debt. Some analysts have compared it to writing the check to cover a credit card bill for things you already charged. The limit now stands at a mind-boggling $14.3 trillion, but said it needs to be raised by August for the government to keep up with its obligations. Experts have warned that failure to raise the limit could ultimately lead to chaos in the financial markets, but Republicans have vowed to oppose the increase unless it's accompanied by spending cuts. Closed-door negotiations, led by Vice President Joe Biden, have been ongoing. The votes to raise the debt ceiling -- there have been 10 since 2001 -- are famous for political posturing. Our research showed that President Obama is no exception. Back in 2006, he joined with other Senate Democrats to vote against raising the debt limit, a measure supported by President George W. Bush. "The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. It is a sign that the U.S. Government can't pay its own bills," Obama said. "Instead of reducing the deficit, as some people claimed, the fiscal policies of this administration and its allies in Congress will add more than $600 million in debt for each of the next five years," he said, adding,"Increasing America's debt weakens us domestically and internationally. Leadership means that 'the buck stops here.' Instead, Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and grandchildren. America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership. Americans deserve better." The Senate narrowly approved raising the limit along partisan lines, 52-48, with all Democrats opposed. Typically, the party that controls the White House has had to take the difficult vote to raise the limit, while the other party was free to criticize. An analysis of the past 10 years of votes on the debt limit from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center shows the vote usually splits along partisan lines, with the president's party voting in support. We asked the Obama re-election campaign for comment on this but we didn't hear back. Obama was asked directly about his vote on April 15, in an interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News. Here's their exchange: "You've got to extend the debt limit," Stephanopolous said. "And your job is a lot tougher because of your vote in the Senate against extending the debt limit. When did you realize that vote was a mistake?" "I think that it's important to understand the vantage point of a senator versus the vantage point of a president," Obama replied. "When you're a senator, traditionally what's happened is, this is always a lousy vote. Nobody likes to be tagged as having increased the debt limit for the United States by a trillion dollars. As president, you start realizing, you know what, we can't play around with this stuff. This is the full faith and credit of the United States. And so that was just an example of a new senator making what is a political vote as opposed to doing what was important for the country. And I'm the first one to acknowledge it." Bachmann said Obama refused to approve an increase in the debt limit when he was a senator, and that he blamed President Bush for failed leadership, as well as Bush's supporters in Congress. She's right on both counts, and we rate her statement True.	None	Michele Bachmann	None	None	None	2011-06-14T17:37:18	2011-06-13	['George_W._Bush', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-02195	Atlanta is the No. 1 trading point for sexual slavery in America. Between 100 and 200 girls are sold into slavery in Atlanta every month.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2014/apr/25/jimmy-carter/politifact-sex-trafficking-plagues-atlanta-carter-/	The topics of sex slavery and human trafficking have gotten plenty of ink lately. Only last month, a study commissioned by the Justice Department showed Atlanta topping a handful of cities -- including Miami and Washington -- in the lucrative sex-trade industry, with projected annual earnings approaching $300 million. Former President Jimmy Carter weighs in on the subject in his 28th and newest book, "A Call to Action: Women, Religion, Violence and Power." Carter is considered one of America’s most prolific writers among former presidents, only topped in most book counts by Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Herbert Hoover. His book focuses on the abuse of women, which he calls "the worst and most pervasive and unaddressed human rights violations on earth." On radio recently to promote the book, the former president said, "Atlanta is the No. 1 trading point for sexual slavery in America." "Between 100 and 200 girls are sold into slavery in Atlanta every month," Carter told Scott Slade on News 95.5/AM 750 WSB on April 6. Numbers like those given by Carter are jolting to people who can’t relate to this dark and complex world where seller, buyer and, oftentimes, victim operate in secrecy. But how these numbers are gleaned merits further examination. Human trafficking, sometimes referred to as modern-day slavery, comes, according to the United States Trafficking Victims Protection Act, largely in two forms: commercial sex and work servitude. The victims of each comply most often through force, fraud or coercion. Sex involving a child under 18 also is classified as human trafficking. Steven Hochman, Carter’s assistant and the director of research at the Carter Center, said the numbers that Carter quoted in the interview with Slade -- 100 to 200 girls sold into slavery every month in Atlanta -- were "conservative." In his book (Page 127), Carter puts the number at between 200 and 300 girls a month. The former president obtained the estimates he used in his book from a presenter at the Carter Center’s Human Rights Defenders’ Forum, Hochman said. The presenter drew from studies released by The Schapiro Group in Atlanta from 2007 to 2011. Those studies estimated that 200 to 400 girls were being sexually exploited each month in Georgia. The Schapiro Group did research on the Internet, on the streets, in hotels and about escort services in an attempt to get a head count of underage girls being sexually exploited commercially. Similar estimates have been used by state agencies, including the Georgia Department of Education, which hosted a two-day conference last year for educators on how to spot and combat human trafficking. More studies are expected on the issue, including one by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. The results of the GBI study should be out in May and will include numbers lower than those reported in The Schapiro Group study, GBI spokeswoman Sherry Lang said. GBI officials have questioned the methodology of The Schapiro Group report, which company President Beth Schapiro stands by and says produced "very conservative numbers." "We are the first to say this is not perfect ... that our numbers are not complete," she said. "But it is a great starting point. And we are ready for more folks to jump in." Alan Seelinger, the state advocacy leader for the nonprofit International Justice Mission, said Carter’s numbers appear on target, based not only on The Schapiro Group study, but also on other tracking that’s taken place. As to Carter’s other statement that Atlanta is the No. 1 trading point for sexual slavery in America, Hochman said the former president was drawing from media reports on the recently released study that was commissioned by the Justice Department and done by the Urban Institute. The four media reports Hochman referenced, including a blog post by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, could be misleading or confusing. They referenced Atlanta as "the capital," "the nation’s major hub" or the "No. 1" city for sex trade. But two of the reports, including the AJC blog, also noted the limited scope of the study. The Urban Institute report focused on eight cities -- Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, Kansas City, Mo., Miami, San Diego, Seattle and Washington. Larger municipalities, such as Chicago, Los Angeles and New York were not included. The study showed that in 2007 the underground sex trade in Atlanta brought in $290 million, the largest amount for seven of the studied cities. (No estimate was made for Kansas City.) But No. 1 in America? One of the study’s authors says that statement wasn’t proven. "We don’t have the data to say which U.S. city brings in the most money nationwide," Meredith Dank told PolitiFact Georgia. Our conclusion: Sex trafficking is clearly a sizable and troubling problem in Georgia and elsewhere. As early as 2005, the FBI identified Atlanta as one of 14 cities where its offices reported having the highest incidence of children used in prostitution. But by its very nature, sex trafficking is hard to track, even estimate. That’s likely true whether you’re trying to size up the profits or gauging how many girls are involved. Carter’s estimate on the number of girls aligns with -- and is on the conservative side of -- other estimates that are out there. His statement about the lucrative nature of the business in Atlanta draws on recent research that found that in 2007 the sex trade generated $290 million in Atlanta -- the highest amount among seven of the eight cities that were studied. But his statement needed context so his audiences understand that it was drawn from a study that was limited in scope. His spokesman rightly points out that the media reports he relied upon, with only a cursory reading, support the label of No. 1 in the nation. You could look deeper into two of those accounts or read the report itself though, and see that it was an overreach. Both the media outlets and the former president could have done a better job. Part of Carter’s statement accurately quotes the estimates that are out there on the girls involved. The part about Atlanta being "the No. 1 trading point for sexual slavery in America" is off base. Overall, we rate Carter’s two-part statement Half True.	None	Jimmy Carter	None	None	None	2014-04-25T00:00:00	2014-04-06	['Atlanta', 'United_States']
pomt-03857	"More than 80 percent of Americans believe we need to have universal background checks."	true	/georgia/statements/2013/mar/12/nan-orrock/lawmaker-uses-polls-make-case-against-georgia-gun-/	Some gun-control advocates use as part of their arsenal in the national debate on this issue that most Americans support their effort, including background checks. Georgia state Sen. Nan Orrock, an Atlanta Democrat, made a specific claim about public support for such checks during a floor debate about Senate Bill 101, which she feared would expand access to guns. "More than 80 percent of Americans believe we need to have universal background checks," Orrock said. SB 101 would allow Georgians as young as 18 to be granted a gun license if they’ve completed basic military training, as long as they were not dishonorably discharged. The bill also would eliminate a ban on guns in public housing, unless a ban is required by federal law or regulation. It passed the Senate by a 41-10 vote and is being reviewed by the state House of Representatives. PolitiFact Georgia decided to do some checking to see whether the senator is correct or is she exaggerating public support for such guidelines. After the December shootings of 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., President Barack Obama put Vice President Joe Biden in charge of coming up with legislation to stem such violence. In January, Obama announced a series of proposals that includes background checks for all gun sales. Federal law currently requires federally licensed gun dealers to conduct background checks before selling a firearm. There is no federal law that requires private gun dealers to do such background checks. A handful of states (Georgia is not one of them) require private dealers to conduct background checks. Gun control advocates want to require private dealers to conduct such a check, which is commonly known as a "universal background check." Several Democrats, including Obama, have said about 40 percent of all guns are sold without a background check. PolitiFact has reviewed this claim several times and noted it’s based on a 1997 study, rating it Half True. Liz Flowers, a spokeswoman for the state Senate Democrats, sent us several polls she says support Orrock’s point. Here’s a look at some of the polls Flowers sent us and some we found: The Pew Research Center conducted a poll Jan. 9-13 that found 85 percent of Americans support background checks for private and gun show sales. Respondents were specifically asked "would you favor or oppose making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks?" The poll talked to 1,502 people in all 50 states. About one-half of the respondents were interviewed on land lines; the other half on their cellphones. One-third of those polled said they had a gun in their home. Thirty-seven percent of the respondents said they were independents, 31 percent said they were Democrats and 27 percent said they were Republicans. CBS News and The New York Times conducted a poll of 1,110 Americans from Jan. 11 to Jan. 15 that found 92 percent of Americans support universal background checks. They were asked "Do you favor or oppose a federal law requiring background checks on all potential gun buyers?" The news organizations reported 85 percent of respondents living in a home with a National Rifle Association member support universal checks. About four of 10 polled said they were independents, one-third said they were Democrats and the rest said they were Republicans. A Fox News poll done Jan. 15-17 found 91 percent of respondents were in favor of criminal background checks on all gun buyers, including those buying at gun shows and private sales. Thirty-nine percent of the respondents said they think of themselves as Democrats, 34 percent Republicans and 23 percent said they were independents. The pollsters interviewed 1,008 Americans. Slightly more than half of the respondents said someone owned a gun in their household. A CNN poll of 1,014 adults conducted between Jan. 14 and Jan. 16, 2011 found 94 percent favored background checks for gun buyers. Those polled were asked "do you favor or oppose background checks on potential gun buyers?" Mayors Against Illegal Guns forwarded us a poll it had conducted that concluded 91 percent of Georgians support mandatory background checks for all gun buyers. The poll was conducted Feb. 18-21. The respondents were asked "do you favor or oppose requiring all gun buyers to pass a criminal background check, no matter where they buy the gun and no matter whom they buy it from?" The largest portion of respondents, 38 percent, said they were Democrats. Thirty-five percent said they were Republicans, and 27 percent described themselves as independents. There was a margin of error of about 3 percentage points to 4 percentage points in each poll. Our partners at PolitiFact in Washington recently fact-checked a claim by Obama that "overwhelming majorities of Americans" support gun legislation "like background checks." PolitiFact noted some of the same polls we reviewed. PolitiFact concluded more than 80 percent of Americans support universal background checks. Obama’s claim, though, was rated Mostly True because his statement suggested strong support for other proposals by his administration, not just universal background checks. To sum up, the senator said more than 80 percent of Americans support universal background checks on gun purchases. In each recent poll we reviewed, the public support for universal background checks was well above 80 percent. We rate Orrock’s claim True.

pomt-01709	Says that, as a Supreme Court justice, Greg Abbott found that a company whose vacuum cleaners were sold door to door "had no responsibility" in the hiring of a salesman who raped a customer.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2014/aug/08/wendy-davis/wendy-davis-claim-about-hiring-salesman-rapist-lac/	In an ominous tone, the narrator of a TV commercial from Texas Democratic gubernatorial nominee Wendy Davis accuses Attorney General Greg Abbott, her Republican opponent, of siding with a vacuum cleaner manufacturer against a woman raped by a salesman in her home. In the 60-second ad, made public by Davis’ campaign on Aug. 7, 2014, the narrator says a door-to-door salesman offering a woman a vacuum cleaner demonstration in her Seguin home in March 1993 but then raped her as her children slept in the next room. "The salesman was a sexual predator on probation," the narrator says, "but the Kirby vacuum cleaner distributor had failed to perform a routine background check on him." "The woman and her husband went all the way to the Texas Supreme Court," the narrator says, "fighting for their right to sue Kirby. Six judges -- Democrats and Republicans -- ruled in their favor and they won," he says. "But Greg Abbott sided with the company against the victim. Saying the company had no responsibility." The words "Kirby owed no duty" appear on the screen, attributed to Abbott, a justice on the court from 1995 until 2001. A Davis campaign press release announcing the ad cited rulings issued in 1998, including the state Supreme Court’s 6-3 majority opinion and a dissent from Abbott. Campaign spokesman Zac Petkanas also emailed us a web link to a Jan. 1, 1999, Associated Press news story stating the court at that time said the Kirby Company should have required its vacuum cleaner distributor to do a background check before hiring salesman Mickey Carter, which would have revealed previous complaints of sexual misconduct. In the Dec. 31, 1998, majority opinion written by Justice Raul Gonzalez, the court agreed with the Austin-based 3rd Court of Appeals that a mandate by Kirby, the manufacturer, that its vacuum cleaners be sold only through home demonstrations gave the company a role to play in who got hired to do door-to-door sales even though a company agreement with its distributors said otherwise. "We hold that the company does owe such a duty," the court said. Specifically, the court said that "because Kirby required in-home demonstrations, the company exercised sufficient control over the sale of its products to end-users to justify imposing a duty of reasonable care in selecting the persons who performed the demonstrations." Kirby had argued its arrangements with vacuum cleaner distributors explicitly said the company shall exercise no control over the selection of individual salespeople. Kirby’s contracts specified: "The full cost and responsibility for recruiting, hiring, firing, terminating and compensating independent contractors and employees of distributor shall be borne by distributor." Abbott’s dissent to the court’s ruling, joined by Justice Priscilla Owen, said Kirby retained control over where the sales work was to be performed -- but not over who was to do that work. "Failure to require background checks of potential dealers relates to who is a dealer, not where the dealer works," Abbott wrote. "As a result, the requisite relation between the control retained and the alleged injury is missing. Because the Court holds to the contrary, I dissent." Abbott summed up: "In essence, the Court rewrites Kirby’s Distributor Agreement and Independent Dealer Agreement to require Kirby to assume control over dealer selection. Because the injury is not related to the control retained by Kirby," Abbott closed, "...Kirby owed no duty to" the woman "under the circumstances of this case." Our emails to the Abbott campaign did not yield responses, but Amelia Chasse of his campaign said in a statement sent to reporters including the Austin American-Statesman’s Jonathan Tilove that Abbott’s dissent still "left intact the liability against the sex offender and his employer." That is, the question in the Supreme Court case concerned only Kirby’s responsibility and did not affect the liability of anyone else in the case. A search of the Nexis database of news stories led us to a news story in the April 20, 2001, Dallas Morning News mentioning the dissent and generally quoting Abbott as saying: "What I was doing as a judge was applying the law." Our ruling In her ad, Davis said Abbott held that a company whose vacuum cleaners were sold door to door "had no responsibility" in the hiring of a salesman who raped a customer in her home. Then-Justice Abbott said the manufacturer had no duty, to be precise. But this claim fails to include the substantive detail that Abbott, unlike the court majority, considered most significant an existing agreement between the manufacturer and distributors explicitly giving full responsibility for such hirings to the distributors who, Abbott implied, had control over checking the background of applicants. We rate this claim as Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-05668	Because of the new health care law, "2.5 million young adults now have coverage."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/16/barack-obama/barack-obama-film-touts-coverage-25-million-young-/	The Road We’ve Traveled -- a 17-minute film from President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign -- touts his achievements in health care, saying that the Affordable Care Act has substantially expanded coverage for millions of Americans. We’re checking several claims from the film, including one that "2.5 million young adults now have coverage." The law requires insurers to provide dependent coverage for children up to age 26 on all policies. The goal is to prevent young adults from becoming uninsured when their parental or college plans would otherwise run out. This provision took effect in September 2010. We found support for the film’s statistic in a Health and Human Services analysis of data from the National Health Interview Survey, a longstanding survey conducted by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The survey found an 8.3 percentage point increase in insurance coverage for the 19-to-25 age group between the third quarter of 2010 and the second quarter of 2011 -- from 64.4 percent to 72.7 percent. The analysis then multiplied 8.3 percent by 29.7 million -- the number of people nationally in that age group -- to come up with the number 2.5 million. We’ll note that the original CDC study, using slightly different methodology, found a smaller number. Using annual and semi-annual figures rather than quarterly numbers, the number grew by 1.3 million. The HHS analysis makes the case that, for various technical reasons, its method is superior. We think both estimates are reasonable, and while the 2.5 million figure got more traction in the media, we also think it’s worth noting that the underlying federal study offers an alternative -- and smaller -- number. In essence, the film cherry-picks the higher number. So the statement is accurate but needs clarification, which fits our definition of Mostly True.

pomt-05730	"[E]mployment in Gwinnett is up more than 3 percent over last year, and unemployment is the lowest of the five core metro counties."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2012/mar/05/charlotte-nash/gwinnett-leaders-boast-employment-mostly-right/	At the beginning of each year, Atlanta-area residents can count on colder weather, higher heating bills and politicians bragging about the counties they lead. In Gwinnett, like most counties, Commission Chairwoman Charlotte Nash gave her State of the County address. Her speech was on Feb. 15. Like any other State of the County address, Nash spoke proudly of Gwinnett’s progress, including a list of achievements that sounded impressive. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether two of these claims, particularly with all the talk about jobs and unemployment, were correct. "[E]mployment in Gwinnett is up more than 3 percent over last year, and unemployment is the lowest of the five core metro counties," Nash told an audience of county leaders and boosters. First, we wondered which counties was Nash referring to in her speech. Her communications director, Joe Sorenson, said they are the counties with the five largest populations: Clayton, Cobb, DeKalb, Fulton and Gwinnett. The Georgia Department of Labor keeps data that looks at employment and the unemployment rate in each one of the state’s 159 counties. In December 2011, the most recent month available before Nash’s speech, the unemployment rates were as follows in each county. Clayton: 11.8 Fulton: 9.8 DeKalb: 9.7 Cobb: 8.5 Gwinnett: 8.4 We’ll note that Clayton’s labor force, at 133,243, is one-third to one-quarter of the size of the other counties. The others have labor forces that range from 372, 274 in Cobb to the highest, 485,690, in Fulton. On that point, Nash was right. As for employment growth in Gwinnett, we had a problem with Nash’s numbers. PolitiFact Georgia subtracted the number of people employed in Gwinnett in December 2010 from those in the workforce in December 2011. The increase was 2.2 percent by our count, not more than 3 percent as Nash said. Sorenson said Nash’s speechwriters made a mistake in the final draft of her address. They initially wrote that employment had risen by 2.3 percent, but they transposed the numbers and it read 3.2 percent. (Sorenson and his staff compared employment between June 2011 and June 2010 to come up with 2.3 percent. We used different months.) The communications staff ultimately changed it in the speech to "more than 3 percent." Nash’s staff was unaware of the error until contacted by PolitiFact Georgia. "It’s one of those silly things that I hope doesn’t reflect on a really good chair," Sorenson said. Nash’s first statement was accurate, but the second part was not because of the editing error. We rate her statement Mostly True.	None	Charlotte Nash	None	None	None	2012-03-05T06:00:00	2012-02-15	['None']
pomt-10095	McCain called for less regulation 21 times just this year.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/29/barack-obama/21-bottles-of-deregulation-on-the-wall/	Following the financial crisis, Sen. Barack Obama has blamed a scarcity of government regulation, and in turn criticized Sen. John McCain for advocating even less regulation over the past year. Here's a passage from Obama's speech in Raleigh, N.C., on Oct. 29, 2008: "When it comes to the economy – when it comes to the central issue of this election – the plain truth is that John McCain has stood with this president every step of the way. Voting for the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy that he once opposed. Voting for the Bush budgets that spent us into debt. Calling for less regulation 21 times just this year. Those are the facts." We'll be the judge of that – at least with respect to the claim that McCain called for less regulation on 21 separate occasions this year. We asked the Obama campaign for evidence, and spokesman Tommy Vietor provided 21 citations of news reports over the past year. Some were clear cut calls for deregulation. For example, "We need less government. We need less regulation," McCain said in a quote that appeared on Washington Week , the PBS show, on Jan. 25, 2008. No doubt about that one. But what about this statement the Obama campaign cited from a July 3, 2008, statement McCain made after goverment figures showed a sixth straight month of job losses: "At a time when our small businesses need support from Washington, we cannot raise taxes, increase regulation, and isolate ourselves from foreign markets." One could quibble over whether a warning against increased regulation is the same as a call for less regulation. And this, from a McCain speech in Livonia, Mich., on Jan. 12, 2008: "Michigan's problems are rooted in failed government policies. Heavy regulation, too much government spending and taxes, and a high cost of doing business has hurt it dearly." That too is an implied, but not explicit, call for less regulation. In all, 14 of the examples the Obama campaign provided were explicit calls by McCain for less regulation. Six others were along the lines of the general condemnations of regulation cited above – what we would call implied calls for less regulation. (The Obama campaign cited two news accounts of the same McCain statement, so we discounted one of those.) Our fellow fact-checkers at CNN arrived at the same conclusion , and labeled Obama's claim "misleading." However, we found several instances of McCain calling for deregulation that the Obama campaign did not cite. For example, later in that Jan. 12 Michigan speech he said, "Michigan – and the United States – needs deregulation, freedom, innovation, and private control of money." On March 4, 2008, in Dallas, he said, "We will campaign to strengthen job growth in America by helping businesses become more competitive with lower taxes and less regulation." In Tampa on April 29, 2008, he called for "ridding the market of both needless and costly regulations." At a town hall event in Denver on July 7, 2008: "Beth (a local business leader) tells me it gets harder every year, not because of the market and competition, but because of government regulations, taxes and the cost of health care. Beth, I promise you, if I'm elected president, we're going to remove these obstacles to your continued success." We should note that since the financial crisis worsened this fall, McCain has softened his advocacy of deregulation of the financial markets. For example, on This Week on Sept. 28, 2008, George Stephanopoulos asked him, "In the past you said you were for less regulations, maybe even a moratorium. Do you think now we're heading into an era where we're going to have to have enhanced regulation?" "Two years ago, I said that I was worried about – co-sponsored legislation because of the excesses of Fannie and Freddie that I saw," McCain replied. "Six years ago, I railed about corporate excess and not expensing stock options. I'm a Teddy Roosevelt Republican. I believe there's a role of government. I believe that government has to be part of the solution. I mean, regulation and oversight has to be absolutely essential. Teddy Roosevelt said unbridled capitalism leads to corruption." Still, between the 14 explicit and six implied calls for deregulation the Obama campaign cited, plus the four explicit calls we found, Obama was on fairly solid ground with this claim. We find it Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-10-29T00:00:00	2008-10-29	['None']

Add the modifier "most liberal member of the U.S. Senate," and you’ve got red meat, especially in a middle-of-the-road state like Ohio. You’ve also got, as you may have guessed, the rap against Sherrod Brown. Josh Mandel, the Ohio treasurer who’s been raising money to run as the Republican nominee against Brown, laid out that accusation in an interview with syndicated radio host Hugh Hewitt on June 24. "I don’t know if you know this, but Sherrod Brown was just voted two years in a row the most liberal senator in the United States of America. Now that’s saying a lot when Bernie Sanders, who’s a socialist, is to the right of you." The National Republican Senatorial Committee made a similar characterization in news release July 6, saying Brown was "rated the most liberal member of the Senate." PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look. Brown, a freshman Ohio Democrat facing reelection next year, supports the federal government playing an active rule in regulating industry, banking, health care and other marketplaces he believes are pocked with abuse. To check our assessment of whether he is, in fact, a liberal, we asked three Ohio political scientists -- Alexander Lamis of Case Western Reserve University, Daniel Coffey of the University of Akron and Eric Rademacher of the University of Cincinnati -- to characterize Brown as either a conservative, moderate or liberal. All three said liberal. Both a Mandel representative and the NRSC cited annual lawmaker ratings by National Journal, a nonpartisan, highly regarded magazine that covers public policy in Washington. National Journal’s ratings are popular with the political press. Cleveland.com, the website of The Plain Dealer, reported Brown’s most recent National Journal rankingwhen it came out in February. The ranking covered 2010. But as National Journal and others noted, Brown was actually in a nine-way tie for the title of most liberal. The other eight were Sanders, the Vermont independent who considers himself a socialist (in the tradition of social democracies like Sweden, Norway and Finland); Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid; and Democrats Ben Cardin and Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, Patrick Leahy of Vermont, Carl Levin and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island. Mathematically, this intrigued us. Consider the number of "most liberal," nine. Now count all the Senate Democrats in last year’s Congress: 57, plus Sanders, who caucuses with the Democrats. Nine out of 58 represents 15.51 percent -- meaning that, with rounding, 16 percent of the entire Senate Democratic caucus came in first place for the most liberal. This surely wouldn’t work in a beauty contest. Even as a criticism of lawmakers, it’s a bit of a Lake Wobegon standard, to use a public radio analogy -- a U.S. Senate where all liberals are above average. But how, exactly, do you define "most liberal?" National Journal did so by reviewing the actions of every senator on 96 roll-call votesand weighing each one on a liberal-to-conservative scale. A number of the measures concerned corporate subsidies or tax breaks that Democrats wanted to end; provisions of the new health care law that Republicans wanted to scrap, and financial reform measures that Democrats said would prevent future banking scandals but Republicans considered too sweeping. Yet not every vote used in the rankings was an obvious liberal or conservative measure. For instance, National Journal included a bill to continue business tax credits while also extending jobless benefits for the long-term unemployed. The same bill also made sure doctors didn’t get a Medicare fee cut. Business groups liked the tax provisions. Then-Sen. George Voinovich, a Republican, voted yes, saying jobless workers needed help. So did Brown. But a majority of Republicans voted no, saying the bill would weigh too heavy on the budget deficit. The partisan split made it a fair measure of the Senate’s Democrat-Republican divide, but Brown’s office questions whether this was really the mark of a liberal position. The same goes for several other votes, such as one confirming a northern Ohio judicial nominee, Benita Pearson. It wasn’t as if Pearson had baggage. Rather, this was one more vote in a tit-for-tat standoff between Republicans and Democrats over confirmations and hardball politics. Like Brown, Voinovich voted yes, but he was the only Republican to do so. Brown has been a senator since 2007, and since lawmakers are often judged on their entire records, we wanted to see how he ranked in the other years. According to National Journal, he was tied for "Most Liberal" again in 2009, this time with four others: Cardin, Whitehouse, Roland Burris of Illinois and Jack Reed of Rhode Island. Sanders came in at 38th. This is where Mandel gets the claim that "Bernie Sanders, who’s a socialist, is to the right" of Brown. But going back earlier, Brown was the Senate’s 28th most liberal member in National Journal’s 2008 analysis, and 27th most liberal in 2007. National Journal isn’t the only player in the ratings game. Others include Americans for Democratic Action, which calls itself "a forthright liberal voice for the nation." The ADA gave Brown a rating of 95 percent for 2010. Five other senators got "perfect" scores of 100 percent. The American Civil Liberties Union gave Brown a score of 93, consistent with many other Senate Democrats. But four Democrats got perfect scores of 100. The League of Conservation Voters, tracking environmental issues, gave Brown a 100 percent score. But 23 other senators shared that perfect score. . And then there’s Voteview.com, a more comprehensive and mathematically driven evaluation compiled by political scientists across the country. Voteview examines votes on every contested bill in Congress, and since Congress works over a two-year term, Voteview ratings only come out every other years. Brown was the 11th most liberal Democrat in the two-year congressional cycle ending in 2010, based on Vote View’s assessment. Sanders came in at No. 6. Brown was the fifth most liberal in the previous Congress, representing his first two years in the Senate, while Sanders was No. 2 during that 2007-2008 period, according to Voteview. So we return to Mandel’s claim that Brown was "voted two years in a row the most liberal senator in the United States of America." and that he is more liberal than Bernie Sanders. Brown tied for first place in both of those years in the National Journal ratings. The tie in the most recent year included 16 percent of the Democratic caucus. To say that Brown was voted "the most liberal senator" misses the broad sweep of lawmakers in that category. As for the claim that Brown was to the left of Sanders, the Senate’s self-described socialist, it only survives if you include one year and one set of rankings, namely, again, National Journal’s. Neither Mandel nor the NRSC said they were basing their claim on exhaustive research or an array of possible ratings. And both were careful to say that Brown was "rated" or "judged" the most liberal, attributing the claim as opposed to making it themselves. Yet there is so much more information available, and so many more details -- the nine-way tie in 2010, the Sanders position in only one of the years (and not the most recent), the other ratings in which Brown was not first. A casual listener or reader would miss out on important context if he or she only heard their claim and didn’t see the fuller picture. A statement that is accurate but leaves out important details like these gets one rating on the Truth-O-Meter: Half True. Comment on this item.

pomt-01653	David Perdue led efforts to ship thousands of jobs overseas.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2014/aug/22/democratic-party-georgia-georgia/jobs-did-go-overseas-how-many-unclear/	Jobs are always a big issue in elections. This week’s federal employment report gave Georgia the dubious honor of ranking 50th among the states and District of Columbia. With Georgia’s 7.8 percent jobless rate, only Mississippi fared worse. Lest anyone miss the blame, the Democratic Party of Georgia recently focused on jobs to draw a distinction between its nominee for the U.S. Senate, former Points of Light CEO Michelle Nunn, and her GOP rival. David Perdue "led efforts to ship thousands of jobs overseas" during his business career, spokesman Michael Smith said in a July 28 press release.. Smith cited Perdue’s leadership role at three firms – Sara Lee, Haggar Clothing Co. and Pillowtex – to arrive at the thousands figure. "It’s how he spent his career, looking to manufacture goods abroad instead of in the United States," Smith said. "That was his management style." Leveling that kind of charge requires a deep dive into Perdue’s career as an executive, starting when he was senior vice president for Sara Lee in 1992. Perdue told PolitiFact Georgia he was sent to Hong Kong for two years to open up the company’s Asia operations. His task, which he accomplished, was to increase manufacturing and contracts in the region. For the first three years of the decade, the company went on a spending spree, including acquiring undergarment maker Playtex in 1991, which focused heavily on foreign firms. By 1994, Perdue’s final year with Sara Lee, the company announced a major restructuring that eliminated between 8,000 and 9,000 jobs worldwide. Among the casualties were 540 jobs at apparel plants in Cartersville, Milledgeville and Wrightsville. A fourth Georgia plant, in Midway, was also shut down. The breakdown of jobs lost at overseas plants could not be determined, though a 1994 statement from Sara Lee said most of those jobs were at European operations. Perdue’s stint at Haggar is even clearer. As senior vice president from 1994 to 1998, Perdue was in charge of international operations and later also domestic operations at the clothing firm. Democrats point to the loss of about 1,950 domestic jobs at Haggar between the key years of 1996 and 1998, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings. In that same period, domestic manufacturing dropped from 29 percent to 12 percent of operations. At least one domestic plant, in Texas, was shut down as part of discontinuing production of men’s suits. Those same SEC filings, though, show that workers in foreign countries also dropped – if only by 65 jobs – during that period. Sales, likewise, were down, from $437 million to $402 million, records show. "It looks like they shifted some production overseas, but not jobs, given the numbers," said Rob Bliss, a finance professor at Wake Forest University. "U.S. facilities were probably bloated and (cutting) them had a big effect on domestic employment." Perdue had a similar goal for Pillowtex, where he wanted to improve sales through aggressive marketing and branding and moving more work overseas. Shifting manufacturing abroad would put Pillowtex on the same page as other textile firms that had already moved offshore and would also save some jobs domestically, Perdue said. The plan was never put into place, though, after Perdue and other top managers found a $40 million-$50 million pension liability that had gone unnoticed as the firm emerged from bankruptcy. Instead of a turnaround, Pillowtex opted to sell off some pieces and eventually shut down entirely. Perdue left as CEO after seven months, with a $1.7 million paycheck, and 7,650 people lost their jobs, including 300 laid off from Pillowtex’s first bankruptcy. In an interview with PolitiFact, Perdue acknowledges that some of his employers, and other firms, have developed a so-called "diversified matrix" that calls for shifting some operations overseas in a bid to save money – and American jobs. It is not a simple matter of trading a job for job, he said, a premise backed up by the complicated income statements and financial reports from the companies themselves. "We have total industries that have been decimated by the tax laws and regulations," Perdue said. "Some of that manufacturing can come back if we cut our corporate tax rate and stop penalizing foreign profits to encourage reinvesting in the United States." With that, we get into the question of political policy. The Democrats’ charge focused more on overall loss of jobs to overseas operations. It’s nearly impossible to prove, or disprove, the number of lost jobs at Perdue’s firms that went aboard. The only documented actual domestic job losses are from Haggar, but those jobs did not go overseas. Undoubtedly, records and news coverage show some job shift did occur. Even the candidate acknowledges as much. He also admits he would have sent jobs - potentially thousands of them - overseas at Pillowtex before a free fall pre-empted his plans and shut down that firm for good. The Democratic Party’s statement is partially accurate. Perdue did lead efforts that resulted in jobs being created overseas while jobs were cut in this country. How many jobs, it’s hard to say. And there is a lot of context needed to understand exactly why companies employed this strategy. Overall, we rate the claim Half True.

pomt-00087	Says "Bob Casey voted in favor of deadly sanctuary cities that released thousands upon thousands of illegal alien criminals and vicious gang members to prey on Pennsylvania streets, to prey all over this country."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/31/donald-trump/donald-trumps-wild-number-sanctuary-city-criminal-/	As President Donald Trump races across the country to gin up Republican support in the midterms, he warns his audiences that Democrats are the party of crime. In Erie, Pa., Trump attacked Democratic Sen. Bob Casey for supporting a policy that Trump said put people in his own state at risk. "Bob Casey is fighting to protect violent criminal aliens," Trump said Oct. 10. "That's what he's doing. Bob Casey voted in favor of deadly sanctuary cities that released thousands upon thousands of illegal alien criminals and vicious gang members to prey on Pennsylvania streets, to prey all over this country." We decided to look at whether so-called "sanctuary cities" are as quick to release dangerous criminals as Trump said. They aren’t. A recurring theme While the details vary from place to place, the term sanctuary city is shorthand for any jurisdiction that won’t hold a person at the end of their jail or prison sentence solely because Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, wants to deport them. Trump reliably wields this against Democrats at his rallies. In Murphysboro, Ill., he said, "Democrat sanctuary cities release these criminal aliens out of jail and right onto your streets." In Mosinee, Wisc., he said, "They strongly support sanctuary cities that refuse to cooperate with federal law enforcement and release known gang members, predators, criminal aliens into our communities." We reached out to the White House for the details behind these claims and did not hear back. Specific to Casey and his voting record, based on the Pennsylvania Republican Party website, the charge goes back to Casey not supporting a 2016 bill that would have cut federal grants to sanctuary cities. On a largely party line vote, the measure failed to clear a procedural hurdle and died. Dicey data The most recent numbers from ICE paint a blurry picture of what’s going on. In response to questions from the Senate Judiciary Committee about gangs, particularly the violent MS-13 gang with ties to El Salvador, ICE said there were 142 instances where jurisdictions nationwide released known or suspected gang members. The releases took place over about nine months between October 2016 and June 2017. The agency said 15 suspected MS-13 members were released, and 127 members of other gangs. The figure are less solid than they appear. ICE noted that it couldn’t say for sure that these were actual gang members, nor could it say that the releases were due to a lack of cooperation from local authorities. It told the senators that the numbers might not reflect "potential administrative errors," or "the jurisdiction’s actual level of cooperation and support." It also said that the count included times when jurisdictions told ICE that a person’s sentence was about to end "but ICE may not have been able to arrange a custody transfer prior to an alien’s release." ICE press releases report instances of ignored detention requests, but sometimes the people are let free by local authorities and then arrested by ICE within a day. This suggests some level of coordination that the data wouldn’t capture. In March 2017, three counties in Maryland disputed an ICE report that said they had ignored its requests to detain certain people. They said they never received those notices. ICE has arrested people with violent criminal records after local authorities released them. For example, in 2016, New York City arrested a Mexican national for drunk driving. Some time before he had served five years for a robbery with a deadly weapon and been deported. ICE sent a detention request Dec. 31, 2016, the day he was released. ICE arrested him a few weeks later. Trump spoke of thousands and thousands of dangerous immigrants released in Pennsylvania and the nation overall. But with ICE counting at most 142 cases nationwide for possible gang members, and the caveats that come with that figure, there’s no evidence for Trump’s sky-high number for a single state. Violent felons and others can be detained Lost in this debate are the details in the various sanctuary policies around the country. In particular, they treat dangerous criminals differently. "A number of the sanctuary policies have carve-outs for individuals with certain types of felony offenses, and some non-felony offenses," said Annie Lai, clinical professor of law at the University of California Irvine. "You want to see if the policy allows for detention for ICE, notification to ICE, transfer to ICE or transfer only with a warrant. Each of these mean different things." California law has a long list of crimes that give local officials the leeway to hold someone for ICE after they’ve served their time. The list includes gang-related offenses, assault, battery, sexual abuse and exploitation, rape, crimes endangering children, burglary, robbery, theft, fraud, forgery, any crime resulting in death, some domestic violence offenses, and drug and weapon-related offenses. Orange County, Calif., uses that flexibility to the utmost. It reported that in the first five months of 2018, it turned 316 inmates over to ICE. At the same time, it reported that it released 414 people and 45 of those were later arrested. Drug violations and resisting a police officer were the most common offenses, but two were for attempted murder. (It’s important to note that arrests are not the same as convictions.) The point is, as a rule, sanctuary laws allow for more dangerous offenders to be held for deportation. There is no detailed Democratic policy on this. Congressional Democrats broadly favor sanctuary city policies, and the party platform emphasizes the deportation of "those who pose a threat to the safety of our communities." Former President Barack Obama pushed for removals, and leaned on some cities, including Philadelphia, to do more to help ICE. Recent Democratic bills that touch on the issue ensure that state and local law enforcement can arrest and detain "previously-deported illegal aliens who have been convicted of a felony." Our ruling Trump said that Casey supported policies that had led to the release of "thousands and thousands" of dangerous criminal immigrants and "vicious gang members to prey on Pennsylvania." The White House provided no evidence to back that up. Casey opposed a bill that would have penalized cities that didn’t cooperate fully with ICE. ICE reported the release of 142 suspected gang members nationwide. The agency itself gave many reasons to question the figure, including the accuracy of the count of actual gang members and the connection to sanctuary city policies. No ICE data supports Trump’s thousands of releases in Pennsylvania or the country as a whole. Sanctuary cities' policies generally allow for detention of felons, which would include the sort of people Trump warns about. We rate this claim False.

pomt-02940	"78702 is the second-most gentrified ZIP code in the entire country."	false	/texas/statements/2013/oct/30/daniel-llanes/austins-78702-has-gentrified-its-not-no-2-gentrifi/	An Austinite skeptical of a possible city move further suggested that a chunk of East Austin has drawn so much interest, it’s nearly No. 1 nationally. In an October 2013 opinion article in the Austin American-Statesman, neighborhood activist Daniel Llanes, writing with Susana Almanza, objected to a proposed urban farm ordinance, which he said would enable landowners to convert single-family lots to commercial purposes. Speaking to pressures on East Austin, Llanes wrote: "In 2000, during the creation of our Neighborhood Plan, more than 600 properties were rezoned from industrial and commercial to residential. This transformed this neighborhood, and today it is a downtown neighborhood considered to be one of the most desirable in the nation. These neighborhoods, and the people of color in them, have made lemonade out of the lemon(s) despite a historic racism that has endured for almost 90 years. The result is that 78702 is the second-most gentrified ZIP code in the entire country." Defining gentrification We know 78702; it’s the inner-city region roughly bounded by Lady Bird Lake to the south, Interstate Highway 35 to the west, Airport Boulevard to the east and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard to the north. And it’s the nation’s second-most what? Merriam-Webster defines gentrify as "to change (a place, such as an old neighborhood) by improving it and making it more appealing to people who have money." Gentrification, it says, is the "process of renewal and rebuilding accompanying the influx of middle-class or affluent people into deteriorating areas that often displaces poorer residents." No doubt, that’s happening in some of Austin’s core neighborhoods, driven in East Austin near the lake by what a May 18, 2011, American-Statesman news story described as a demographic transformation. "The number of African Americans residing in Central East Austin -- once considered the epicenter of black and brown life in Central Texas -- shrank by 27 percent during the past decade," the story said, "while the number of whites living there increased by 40 percent, and whites surpassed blacks as the second-largest racial or ethnic group. "African Americans or Hispanics still hold a majority or plurality in most East Austin census tracts," the story said. "But white residents had become the majority in two of the tracts by 2010." The story said the Hispanic population in Central East Austin also fell -- by 9.3 percent -- during the period, according to the newspaper’s analysis of 2010 census data for 20 tracts roughly bounded by Interstate 35, the lake, U.S. 290 East and U.S. 183. "The population shifts occurred as a development boom accelerated during the last half of the decade, attracting new residents into predominantly low-income, minority neighborhoods for myriad reasons, including the relatively low property prices there, proximity to downtown and something talked about a lot in Austin: quality of life," the story said. Finally, the story noted that discussions of gentrification often are cast against the legacy of the city's 1928 master plan, which segregated blacks to neighborhoods east of what is now I-35, "creating a painful hard-line history of inequities between east and west, whites and minorities." Charting increases in white residents Llanes told us that a chart produced by the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a charity focused on education policy, was the basis of the 78702 claim. According to the chart, from 2000 to 2010, the 78702 ZIP code trailed only a Tennessee ZIP code for its increase in white residents. According to the chart, dated June 14, 2012, neighborhoods in 78702 saw a 33 percentage point increase in white residents — going from 23 percent of the ZIP code’s residents in 2000 to 56 percent in 2010. And that surge, the chart says, trailed only the 39 percentage point increase in white residents of Chattanooga’s 37408 ZIP code. In the decade, 78702 saw an overall population decrease of 5 percent, the chart says. And is the surge in white residents proof that 78702 was No. 2 in gentrification? Not according to the chart’s creator, Michael Petrilli, who said in a June 2012 blog post accompanying a revision of his original chart that his breakdown should not be taken as identifying ZIP codes with the greatest gentrification. In his initial chart, dated June 11, 2013, Petrilli said he "equated ‘gentrification’ with a significant increase in the white share of a neighborhood’s population. In my defense, I did admit that looking at the numbers by race was far from perfect—gentrification is a socio-economic issue—but census income data by (ZIP) code are not yet available for 2010. Still, I chose to use the ‘gentrification’ word, and it’s reasonable to point out its inaccuracy." More recently, Petrilli told us by telephone that surges in white residents are "obviously a very imperfect proxy" for gentrification. Separately, Ryan Robinson, the city of Austin demographer, replied to our inquiry about 78702 by saying in an email that gentrification is "way more complex than simple rapid racial change. It really has far more to do with the displacement of lower-income households by higher-income households, regardless of race, resulting in a fundamental change in the character of the neighborhood." "But for sure, without question, 78702, or at least certain parts of 78702, are indeed gentrifying," Robinson wrote. He added that the "hard parts to measure are the velocity and spatial extent of gentrification." 78702 by changes in median income and other prosperity indicators Seeking better ways of gauging the gentrification of 78702, we solicited breakdowns of U.S. Census Bureau data from American-Statesman data editor Christian McDonald; Lloyd Potter, the demographer for the state of Texas; and Elizabeth Mueller, a University of Texas associate professor of architecture. Mueller checked changes in the number of residents living at two times the federal poverty level in the 25 urban ZIP codes that were identified by Petrilli as experiencing the biggest bumps in white residents. She emailed us a spreadsheet indicating that between the 2000 Census and the U.S. Census Bureau’s latest five years of its American Community Survey, taken from 2007 through 2011, the 78702 ZIP code had a 17 percentage point decrease in families living at or below two times the federal poverty level. That placed the ZIP code 12th among the 25 ZIP codes pulled from Petrilli’s list, Mueller said. Potter compiled median household incomes for the nation’s ZIP codes in 1999 and compared them with such incomes as gauged by the latest five years of the bureau’s community surveys. McDonald then helped us focus on how much such incomes changed in ZIP codes with 10,000 residents or more. The result: 78702, home to nearly 20,700 residents in 2011, saw a 12 percentage point improvement in median household income between the 2000 census and the latest five community surveys; it ranked about 300th in such growth among the 1,700 populous ZIP codes that similarly saw increases. Potter also compared the share of residents in ZIP codes in 1999 living at or below the federal poverty level with the share of residents who lived at or below poverty in 2011. According to a spreadsheet he emailed us analyzing the rates in counties home in 2000 to metropolitan areas of 1 million residents or more, 29.4 percent of the residents of the 78702 ZIP code lived in poverty in 1999; the level was 27.2 percent in 2011. The difference of 2.2 percentage points ranked the 78702 ZIP code about 2,000th nationally for its reduction. McDonald, drawing on census data, compared the median value of single-family homes. His spreadsheet indicated that, unadjusted for inflation, this factor in the 78702 ZIP code was up 192 percent, more than $100,000, between the 2000 census and five latest community surveys. This change in value, by percentage, placed the ZIP code 64th among ZIP codes home to 10,000 residents or more, according to the spreadsheet. Definitely gentrifying, but... Finally, we talked through our statistical breakouts with Mueller. She said by phone that while some of the indicators were not ideal for gauging gentrification--changes in residents living at or below the poverty level largely reflects people in public housing, she suggested--a reasonable upshot of our foray is the 78702 ZIP code is "not the second-most anything" nationally in terms of gentrification. "But is this area gentrifying? It is. In Austin, it’s definitely one of the areas experiencing the most dramatic change," Mueller said. "Gentrification is generally about several issues. It’s about displacement of low-income people, its about changing the character of a community, sometimes physically and socially, and it means loss of community voice. Right now, we’re losing low-income residents (in 78702). It’s up for grabs about (losses of) community character and community voice." Our ruling Llanes said 78702 is the nation’s second-most gentrified ZIP code. According to one breakdown, that East Austin area experienced the nation’s second-greatest urban increase in white residents from 2000 to 2010. However, changes in white residents alone are not an accurate way to measure gentrification, which is multi-factored. By other indicators, including changes in poverty, median household income and the value of single-family homes, 78702 has become more prosperous. Stacked up against other ZIP codes, though, it is not No. 2 nationally. Gentrified? Sure. Second most, nationally? Most evidence indicates otherwise. We rate this claim as False.

pomt-03806	The United States spends "$2.2 billion on free cell phones, $27 million on Moroccan pottery classes" and pays for "the travel expenses for the watermelon queen in Alabama."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/mar/24/sean-duffy/uncle-sam-pays-free-cell-phones-pottery-classes-mo/	To hear U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis., you’d think the former lumberjack and reality TV star might like to take a chainsaw to government spending and, um, bring it into the "real world." Indeed, the one-time county prosecutor came ready with what he considered to be evidence of waste when he appeared on the March 10, 2013, edition of "Upfront with Mike Gousha," a public affairs program on WISN-TV (Channel 12) in Milwaukee. Noting U.S. unemployment was edging down, Gousha asked: "Don’t you, your party, the president, don’t all of you in Washington feel under pressure to make sure that government doesn’t muck up what appears to be a rebounding economy?" Duffy acknowledged the improving jobs picture, then said: "We’re going in the right direction; that’s positive. But to think that you can’t cut -- we spend $2.2 billion on free cell phones, $27 million on Moroccan pottery classes; we pay for the travel expenses for the watermelon queen in Alabama. There are -- story after story about wasteful spending in government. Let’s cut that." (Duffy made the same multi-part claim two weeks earlier in emotional statements to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke during a congressional committee meeting. In that exchange, Duffy also said the government spent $700 billion to see how long shrimps can run on a treadmill. His staff later told a reporter he meant to say $700,000.) So, federal funds for free cells, pottery classes and a watermelon queen? Let’s check this out. For each of the three parts of Duffy’s claim, we’ll look at evidence provided by Duffy’s staff and information we collected ourselves. Duffy relied in part on "Wastebook 2012," which is produced by U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla. 1. Cell phones To back his claim that the federal government spent $2.2 billion on "free cell phones," Duffy cited a February 2013 article in The Wall Street Journal and a 2012 Federal Communications Commission report. The Journal revealed that the government spent $2.2 billion in 2012 on phone subsidies for the poor, but that more than 2 million people served by the Lifeline program hadn’t proved they were eligible. Lifeline, which is funded by fees paid by all cell and landline customers, is available to low-income people, including those on Medicaid, food stamps and other assistance. Wireless carriers often offer free phones to Lifeline customers, the FCC report says. PolitiFact National in 2012 and PolitiFact Texas in 2013 examined similar claims about free cell phones -- although those claims, unlike Duffy’s, tied the program directly to Obama. Lifeline started in 1985 to subsidize home phone service; cell service was added in 2008 under President George W. Bush. Subsidies for cell service now make up 75 percent of the program. Lifeline doesn’t actually give away phones, but rather pays an average of $9.25 (the subsidy varies by state) to a user’s phone company toward monthly home or cell service. However, many people end up with a free phone from a cellular carrier if they sign up for cell service with Lifeline. Assurance Wireless, for example, advertises a variety of Lifeline plans, as well as a free phone. Both the Coburn report and the FCC report also note that, to attract Lifeline customers, many carriers offer free phones. So, most but not all of the $2.2 billion in the Lifeline program subsidizes cellular bills. And, although the program itself doesn’t give away phones, it’s common for customers to end up with a free phone as a result of Lifeline. 2. Pottery classes Duffy cited a December 2011 federal audit to support his statement that the United States spends "$27 million on Moroccan pottery classes" (a claim that’s also been made by conservative talk show host Bill O’Reilly). The audit evaluated a $27 million project of the U.S. Agency for International Development that was begun in 2009 "to provide technical assistance to improve Morocco’s economic enabling environment by improving the business climate, using water sustainably for agricultural growth and strengthening workforce development." So, the program is broader than what Duffy claimed, although the audit did single out pottery classes. Local residents reported that the classes from a U.S.-based trainer were ineffective, partly because the trainer spoke only English and the trainer’s translator wasn’t fluent in English. Coburn’s book also highlighted the pottery classes, but noted that only part of the $27 million went toward them. So, Duffy is wrong on this part of his claim. 3. Watermelon queen The third part of Duffy’s claim was that the federal government "pays for the travel expenses for the watermelon queen in Alabama." He cited a U.S. Department of Agriculture document on fruit and vegetable projects funded in all 50 states in fiscal 2012. Alabama got $401,366 for 13 projects, including one to "partner with the Alabama Watermelon Association to promote the consumption of Alabama’s watermelon through appearances of the Alabama Watermelon Queen at various events and locations." The Coburn book said $25,000 in federal money went toward the queen’s travel expenses. So, Duffy is correct on this part of his claim, although it should be made clear that Uncle Sam picks up only part of the queen’s tab. Our rating Duffy said the federal government spends "$2.2 billion on free cell phones, $27 million on Moroccan pottery classes" and pays for "the travel expenses for the watermelon queen in Alabama." Overall, Duffy’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details -- our definition of Half True.

pomt-05125	Atlanta Tea Party co-founder Debbie Dooley "wants gas taxes raised."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2012/jun/25/citizens-transportation-mobility/pro-transportation-group-says-tax-foe-pro-tax/	The folks leading the charge in support of a regionwide penny-per-dollar sales tax for transportation projects have raised a question to critics who don’t like the plan: So what’s your solution? A press release on that question brought on a verbal dispute we felt was worthy of a fact-check as both sides search for any weakness in the opponent’s position, showing what a tightly contested campaign this has become. Sales tax supporters thought they found the answer to their question when they read quotes attributed to Debbie Dooley, a prominent Georgia tea party activist who is among the most vocal opponents of the plan. "Tea Party leader wants gas taxes raised," read the headline to a press release written by Citizens for Transportation Mobility, an advocacy group in favor of the referendum. "Dooley publicly supports a never-ending tax with less public accountability." Dooley countered that the group wasn’t telling the whole story about her position on gas taxes. "We have repeatedly said until elected officials show us they are responsible with our tax dollars, they’re not getting a dime," Dooley told PolitiFact Georgia. In 2010, the Georgia Legislature voted to allow residents to vote by referendum on whether to increase their sales tax rates to pay for transportation projects. The Legislature divided the state into 12 regions to give residents choices of potential transportation projects that may best help their region, if they choose to do so. In a 10-county region that encompasses the city of Atlanta, its largest counties and other suburbs, the tax could fund 157 transportation projects if the referendum passes. The vote is scheduled for July 31. Some referendum opponents have a list as long as Buford Highway that outlines their objections to the plan. One reason they’ve said they don’t want it is they’re not in favor of an additional tax across an entire region. They don’t trust elected officials to spend the money as planned. Dooley outlined those concerns and others at a June 12 forum organized by the Civic League for Regional Atlanta. "We don’t feel like they’ve been fiscally responsible with the tax dollars they’ve been given," Dooley said of elected officials in her opening remarks. Dooley said she and others have presented some ideas to referendum supporters, but were rebuffed. She then talked about the gas tax. "We support increasing the gas tax, which has not been done since 1991," Dooley said at the forum, Citizens for Transportation Mobility wrote in the press release. Georgia’s excise gas tax is currently 7.5 cents a gallon, the second lowest in the country. (Excise taxes are special taxes on the purchase of items such as gasoline, alcoholic beverages and tobacco products. Excise taxes are usually fixed amounts per item, rather than percentages of the price.) It has not changed since 1971, which Dooley actually said at the forum. Citizens for Transportation Mobility criticized Dooley’s idea. "We have been waiting on the opposition to come up with their ‘Plan B’ and we now see that they want to build more toll roads, raise gas taxes and take away the power of citizens to vote on a specific project list," said Che Watkins, campaign manager for Citizens for Transportation Mobility. "We are frankly shocked that a tea party leader would advocate for higher permanent taxes with less public accountability." Dooley actually said more than what was mentioned in the press release, a video of the meeting showed. "One of the funding mechanisms we would look at once the gas prices came down to a manageable level is to increase the gas tax," she said. Citizens for Transportation Mobility spokeswoman Saba Long defended the organization’s position, noting that Dooley didn’t say how much lower gas prices must be in order for her to support increasing the gas tax. "She’s trying to have it both ways," Long said. Dooley told PolitiFact Georgia gas prices must be $2 a gallon or less before she would consider supporting an increase to excise gas taxes. Dooley did float the idea of raising the gas tax. But she said in the same sentence that gas prices must come down first. She also stated her distrust of elected officials with tax dollars. Neither was included in the press release. The Citizens for Transportation Mobility statement was based on an accurate comment by Dooley, but it leaves out some important context. Under our rating system, that is a classic Half True.	None	Citizens for Transportation Mobility	None	None	None	2012-06-25T06:00:00	2012-06-13	['None']
pomt-14904	Says his plan would cut taxes without increasing the deficit.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/05/donald-trump/donald-trumps-false-claim-his-tax-plan-wouldnt-inc/	A week after the third GOP debate, Donald Trump is still salty at CNBC’s John Harwood, the moderator who asked him whether his 2016 bid was a "comic book version" of a presidential campaign. In asking the question, Harwood brought up the billionaire’s proposal to cut taxes without adding to the deficit — a goal, Harwood said, that’s nigh impossible. Trump agreed with the characterization but dodged the plausibility question. Here’s a part of the exchange: Harwood: "You talked about your tax plan. You say that it would not increase the deficit because you'd cut taxes $10 trillion, and the economy..." Trump: "Take off that ..." Harwood: "...would take off like — hold on. Hold on. The economy would take off like a rocket ship." Trump: "Right. Dynamic." Harwood: "I talked to economic advisers who have served presidents of both parties. They said that you have as much chance of cutting taxes that much without increasing the deficit as you would of flying away from that podium by flapping your arms around." Trump: "Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who is a great guy, who came out the other day and said, ‘I love Trump's tax plan.’ " For the record, Larry Kudlow, a conservative economist and former CNBC anchor, said in September that he "really likes Trump’s plan." During the debate, Kudlow told Breitbart that he specifically loves Trump’s proposal for a 15 percent corporate tax rate but "can’t speak for the whole plan." But what about the whole plan? Will it be, as Trump wrote in a Wall Street Journal column, "revenue neutral"? We didn’t hear back from the Trump campaign. But based on analyses conducted by two tax groups, Trump’s plan would lead to a revenue loss of $10 trillion to 12 trillion over 10 years. The plan Released on Sept. 28, Trump’s tax plan aims to, you guessed it, "make America great again" by providing tax breaks for middle-class Americans, simplifying the tax code, growing the American economy and not adding to our debt and deficit. It includes: • Four income tax brackets with rates of 0, 10, 20 and 25 percent, with no deductions except for the charitable and mortgage interest deductions; • A corporate tax rate of 15 percent, an end to the deferment of overseas corporate income, and repatriating of foreign income at a 10 percent rate; • A pass-through business income tax rate of 15 percent; • A capital gains tax at 0, 15 and 20 percent; and a tax on carried interest as ordinary income; • Eliminating the alternative minimum tax, the net investment income surtax, the estate tax and the Affordable Care Act taxes. The impact Both right- and left-leaning groups found that Trump’s plan could lead to at least a $10 trillion revenue loss in a decade, without factoring in interest. The liberal Citizens for Tax Justice pegged the cost of Trump’s plan at $12 trillion over 10 years and pointed out that 37 percent of the tax cuts would go to the top 1 percent. Trump’s plan, according to the free market-oriented Tax Foundation, would cut taxes by almost $12 trillion and also lead to an 11 percent higher GDP. With this projected growth, Trump’s plan would still reduce revenues by $10.14 trillion. To make the plan revenue neutral, Trump would have to make huge spending cuts. Experts said the scale of the cuts would not be realistic, given that Trump himself has said he intends to protect popular programs such as Medicare and Social Security. "It’s hard to imagine any way that this could be revenue neutral … unless you’re going to go after entitlements in a big way," said Roberton Williams of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, which hasn’t released an analysis of Trump’s plan yet. "Contrary to Trump’s assertion that his plan would not increase the deficit, it would," Scott Hodge of the Tax Foundation told us. He added that economic growth, investment, higher wages and jobs are far more important than adding or decreasing the deficit. Our ruling Trump said his tax plan would not increase the deficit. Free market-oriented and liberal groups alike say Trump’s tax plan would lead to a $10 trillion revenue loss, even if it did create economic growth. Since Trump has said he will not slash retirement programs like Social Security and Medicare, experts doubt that any spending cuts he made would result in a revenue-neutral tax plan. We rate Trump’s claim False.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2015-11-05T11:02:17	2015-10-28	['None']
pomt-09986	"Venezuela is a country whose defense budget is probably 1/600th of the United States."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/apr/21/barack-obama/obama-says-venezuela-defense-budget-1600th-uss/	President Barack Obama was criticized by conservatives recently for a couple of handshakes and photo opportunities with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez at the Summit of the Americas. In a news conference after the summit, on April 19, 2009, Obama dismissed those critics, saying the Venezuelan military is not consequential enough to worry about. According to the Washington Post, Obama said, "Venezuela is a country whose defense budget is probably 1/600th of the United States. They own Citgo," the retail arm of Venezuela's national oil company. "It's unlikely that as a consequence of me shaking hands or having a polite conversation with Mr. Chavez that we are endangering the strategic interests of the United States." Chavez has significantly increased the Venezuelan defense budget in recent years, and so we wondered about the 1/600th figure. First, the numbers. According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Venezuela had a defense budget of $3.3 billion in 2008, up from $2.6 billion in 2007. By comparison the United States is spending $711 billion on the military this year, including the cost of the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. So Obama is slightly underestimating the Venezuelan defense budget. It is actually about 1/215th the size of the United States'. The size and firepower of U.S. defense forces also dwarf Venezuela's. But Chavez has made headlines in recent years for his efforts to ramp up and modernize the Venezuelan military, purchasing nearly $3 billion worth of assault rifles, fighter jets and helicopters from Russia. Venezuela also has made large defense purchases from Spain, Belarus and China, for everything from patrol boats and ammunition to radar systems for military air operations. Even with that, Venezuela is still "at best a second-rate regional power," said Larry Birns, director of the nonprofit Center on Hemispheric Affairs, which researches and reports on Latin American affairs. "Historically, the Venezuelan military has been a fairly rag-tag outfit, heavily politicized and exceedingly corrupt," Birns said. Even with Chavez's efforts to improve the military, "They just don't have the stuff that could pose a serious threat to the United States." According to a May 2007 analysis prepared by COHA research fellow Alex Sanchez, "Even if Venezuela is upgrading its military more than other countries in its category, it is most likely doing so for defensive purposes. It would be ludicrous to believe that the country would launch any kind of military aggression against the U.S., shooting at Stealth bombers with rifles." So, yes, Obama's numbers were a little off. We're not going to ding him too hard for that, though, as his overall point is correct. And Obama's use of the word probably 1/600th suggests it is more of a guestimate than a hard statistic. The Venezuelan military is indeed a tiny fraction of the size of the U.S. military. And so we rule his statement Mostly True.

pomt-06921	"There’s pretty much no question that [the curfew ordinances] aren’t effective in either reducing crime or preventing harm to young people."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2011/jul/22/mike-males/limited-studies-say-teen-curfews-ineffective/	In a May 31 news release, just as Atlanta’s teens were embracing the warm glow of summer vacation, city officials announced plans to enforce a long-standing juvenile curfew. The rationale was safety. "I want everyone in the City of Atlanta, especially our young people, to enjoy the summer months," Mayor Kasim Reed said in the statement. "At the same time, it is vital that we keep everyone safe." But Mike Males, a researcher with the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice, said in an Atlanta Journal-Constitution story two weeks later that the mayor’s logic is flawed. "There’s pretty much no question that [the ordinances] aren’t effective in either reducing crime or preventing harm to young people," he said. That’s a strong position to take against a very popular crime-reduction tactic. Curfews have been around forever, imposed by moms and mayors alike. In 1884, President Benjamin Harrison called them "the most important municipal regulation for the protection of children in American homes from the vices of the street." Curfews fell out of favor in the mid-20th century and did not regain popularity until the Clinton administration. By the mid-1990s, the U.S. Conference of Mayors found 70 percent of nearly 350 cities surveyed had some sort of nighttime curfew. The overwhelming majority of cities considered the curfew effective and a good use of police time. Atlanta’s current curfew has been on the books since 1977, although enforcement has waxed and waned. The curfew says young people 16 and under cannot be on the streets unsupervised past 11 p.m. Sunday through Thursday and after midnight on Fridays and Saturdays. It includes some exceptions for work, school events and emergencies, making it similar to curfews in other cities. Violation of the curfew nets a warning on the first offense and a $1,000 fine and possible jail time on subsequent violations, but it’s the parent or guardian who gets the punishment. So we know that curfews are popular, but is Males right when he says they don’t work? For the answer, we turn to ... Males. It turns out, he is one of the leading researchers in the effectiveness of teen curfews and his work is cited frequently in scholarly papers and the media. In a widely referenced 1998 paper on the impact of curfews in California, Males and co-author Dan Macallair found curfews "had no discernible effect on youth crime" based on a statistical analysis of cities enforcing the laws. In some cases, curfew cities actually saw crime go up compared with cities that did not enforce a curfew, they found. Males and Macallair said crime statistics in curfew cities "suggest that solutions are more complex and multifaceted." In an interview this week, Males said curfews presuppose that all young people are equally likely to commit a crime. Since they aren’t, curfews become an inefficient tool for combating youth crime, perhaps wasting police resources, he said. Males’ research is backed up by a popular survey of studies on curfews published in 2003 by criminal justice researcher Kenneth Adams, who also found scant evidence that the laws accomplished what most people believed they did. "Studies consistently report no change in crime in relation to curfews," Adams wrote, although he indicated curfews likely would remain popular. "The seduction of common-sense reasoning sometimes is too strong to be swayed by scientific evidence," he wrote. While the researchers agree that curfews do not lower juvenile crime, they also admit their conclusions rest on relatively few studies. As a result, Adams allows that curfews "may encourage parental responsibility," and he wrote there is some evidence a short-term curfew focused on certain high-crime areas does reduce crime. But a more recent stab at measuring the effectiveness of curfews comes from University of California at Berkley economist Patrick Kline. Using an economic theory called the substitution effect, Kline says there is evidence that curfews curb youth crime. In consumer economics, the substitution effect holds that higher prices result in lower consumer demand. With curfews, Kline said the criminal penalties for curfew-breakers results in a decline in youth crime of up to 10 percent. Kline’s paper has been picked up across the country by curfew advocates looking for a champion, but Males said the study has significant shortcomings. For example, Kline does not compare cities that have curfews with similar cities without curfews to see whether crime is declining generally. In fact, juvenile arrests peaked in the mid-1990s and has been declining nationally ever since, along with arrests for lots of adult crimes. Males said Kline’s assessment does not take those larger shifts into consideration. Males also said there are some problems with applying a theory governing how milk prices get set with criminal justice. "The problem with economic substitution theory is that not all juveniles are equally likely to commit crimes," he said. Kline’s paper has gone through several revisions, and according to his website, is awaiting publication in American Law and Economics Review. So the weight of academic opinion sides with Males’ assessment that curfews do not reduce crime. But Kline’s interpretation suggests the question deserves more research. Males saves himself with the qualifier "pretty much," but at least some still are asking questions, leaving us with a ruling of Mostly True.

pomt-02747	The Employment Non-Discrimination Act "discriminates against Christian daycare, Christian parents, Christian business owners, and the rights of religious freedom."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/dec/16/traditional-values-coalition/religious-activist-group-says-enda-would-discrimin/	Early in the 2014 campaign season, religion has played an important role in the Arkansas Senate race. Incumbent Mark Pryor, a Democrat, released an ad recently about how the Bible guides him. Interestingly, when the National Republican Senatorial Committee attacked Pryor on the issue, challenger Rep. Tom Cotton’s office went against fellow Republicans to stand with Pryor. But that’s not where the debate about Pryor’s faith ends. It circles back to his November vote in favor of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, a bill that would prevent workplace discrimination based on sexuality and gender identity. It passed in the Senate but hasn’t been taken up by the House. While the bill’s status is in flux, the debate among lawmakers, advocacy groups and religious leaders continues. The Traditional Values Coalition, a religious activist group, criticized Pryor for his ENDA vote. Andrea Lafferty, the coalition’s president, highlighted a perceived contradiction of Pryor’s religious beliefs in a Dec. 6 mass fundraising email. "There's a reason why Pryor is attempting to run as a Christian in Arkansas," she said. "It's because Pryor has voted for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) in Washington, a bill that discriminates against Christian daycare, Christian parents, Christian business owners, and the rights of religious freedom." PolitiFact wanted to take a closer look at how religious organizations would fare if the bill becomes law. American Christianity and LGBT rights Before we take a look at the bill, let’s contextualize the coalition’s claim in the broader context of American Christianity. It’s important to note that within Christianity, gay rights is a divisive and complex issue. The Traditional Values Coalition’s ENDA disapproval is shared by other Christian groups, like the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. They expressed their view in an Oct. 31 press release: "The USCCB continues to promote the dignity of both work and marriage and to oppose unjust discrimination on any grounds, including those related to homosexual inclination or sexual identity. But we cannot support a bill, like ENDA, that does not justly advance the dignity of all workers and authentic non-discrimination." At the same time, groups like ReconcilingWorks, a Lutheran group that welcomes gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) members, support ENDA’s passage. "ReconcilingWorks: Lutherans for Full Participation believes that all hardworking people — including lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people — should have a fair chance to earn a living and provide for their families without fear of being fired for reasons that have nothing to do with their job performance," spokesman Tim Fisher said. "We strongly support the passage of ENDA." As the gay rights movement gains more traction, some Christians have changed their perspectives. "Most American Christians do not want a gay pastor overseeing their church, and that is not likely to change soon," said Kate Bowler, an American Christianity professor at Duke University. "However, we are seeing thawing numbers of those who agreed that gay people should be allowed same-sex unions." The basics The ENDA bill would prohibit private-sector employers and government employers on the local, state and federal levels from discriminating against employees based on sexual orientation and gender identity. That protects people who identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender. Under the law, employers can’t fire or refuse to hire people based on actual or perceived sexuality and gender identity (which need not align with a person’s biological identity). Churches and other institutions with religious purposes (like schools and daycares) are exempt from the ENDA rules, just as they are from the religious discrimination portion of the Civil Rights Act of 1964’s Title VII. Under Title VII, and therefore under ENDA, religious organizations, which need not be church-run, would be exempt. Additionally, all businesses with fewer than 15 employees are exempt, whether they’re religious or not. Nelson Tebbe, a professor at Brooklyn Law School who specializes in religious liberty, said ENDA’s religious exemption exceeds Title VII’s. "It’s broader because the religious exemption in Title VII only allows religious organizations to discriminate on the basis of religion," he said. But it doesn’t allow religious groups to discriminate based on factors like an employee’s gender or race. So by permitting religious organizations to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, ENDA allows them more flexibility than Title VII. Let’s break down the Traditional Values Coalition claim to see how each mention would be treated if ENDA becomes law: Daycare: "If it were a secular daycare that just happened to be owned by a religious individual with a conviction that prohibited them from hiring LGBT folk, then the exemption would not apply," Tebbe said. He added that nonprofit daycares with religious affiliations would be exempt. Parents: "There is nothing in ENDA that would require parents to alter their beliefs or what they teach their children about religion, homosexuality, marriage equality, et cetera," said Ian Thompson, an American Civil Liberties Union representative for LGBT issues. Business owners: For-profit companies with 15 employees or more would need to abide by ENDA, said Dena Sher, an ACLU religious liberty counsel. But Christian nonprofits and Christian (or any other) businesses with fewer than 15 employees would be exempt. Tebbe also noted that religious organizations who don’t hire LGBT people are protected under ENDA. Rights of religious freedom: "Not only does the Constitution protect religious freedom broadly, but existing federal discrimination law already prohibits discrimination on the basis of religion," Thompson said. The Traditional Values Coalition doesn’t believe that these religious exemptions are broad enough. "ENDA would not cover any secular companies and organizations that are run by committed Christians," said Harry Mihet, a Liberty Counsel lawyer the coalition referred us to. Mihet is correct. But as far as discrimination goes, in the bill’s full text, there’s no reference to Christianity, or to any other individual religion, for that matter. All religions are treated the same and can legally invoke the same exemption. And Christianity isn’t the only religion that has historically grappled with acceptance of sexuality and gender identity issues. Merriam-Webster defines discrimination as "the practice of unfairly treating a person or group of people differently from other people or groups of people." To say that the law discriminates against Christians doesn’t fit based on our experts’ interpretation of the bill and the inclusion of an overall religious exemption that applies to any religion, not just Christians. "If you had some exemption that wasn’t available to Christians, that would be discrimination," said Doug Laycock, a law and religious studies professor at the University of Virginia. "The only way they’re treated differently is they get an exemption." Our ruling The Traditional Values Coalition said ENDA discriminates "against Christian daycare, Christian parents, Christian business owners, and the rights of religious freedom." The bill’s religious exemption indicates that churches, church-run initiatives and other religious businesses need not comply by employing people of all sexualities and gender identities. And there’s no special negative treatment for Christians. Businesses of any religion could qualify for the exemption. Individuals of any faith who oppose sexuality would have to abide by the law, so no religion is singled out. We can understand why religious conservatives may take issue with this bill. However, the rhetoric in the email is too broad and overstated, and claims to speak for all Christians. We rate this claim False.

pomt-02606	"We have the lowest beer tax in the nation."	false	/oregon/statements/2014/jan/24/rod-monroe/does-oregon-have-lowest-beer-tax-nation/	After the decision by Washington voters last year to privatize the sale of liquor, Oregon legislators are now wrestling with whether to follow suit. While no decision is likely during February’s monthlong legislative session, issues surrounding alcoholic beverages are very much on the table in Salem these days. At a recent work session on the topic, Sen. Rod Monroe, D-Portland, noted that prices climbed dramatically in Washington after voters there allowed large retailers such as Costco to sell distilled spirits. He said Oregon should be cautious in making big changes and observed that if more money is the goal, expanding the number of state-owned liquor stores would provide one solution. Then he added: "If our concern is revenue, we ought to look at the fact that we have the lowest beer tax in the nation." While this may be welcome news, coming right before next weekend’s Super Bowl, we wondered if that’s true. Does Oregon have the lowest beer tax in the country? PolitiFact Oregon checked. We called Scott Drenkard, an economist with the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan tax research group in Washington, D.C. Its website includes a weekly map of the United States showing beer tax rates in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Drenkard, noting that the statistics are drawn from another group, the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, said Oregon ranks 45th nationally with consumers paying a tax rate of 8 cents a gallon of beer. That comes out to just under 4 cents tacked on to the price of a six-pack. The rate puts Oregon behind only Colorado, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Missouri and Wyoming, which has a 2 cent-a-gallon beer tax. Tennessee, by contrast, ranks first at $1.17 per gallon. Alaska’s $1.07 is second. Monroe, contacted via email for a response, wrote: "If you add in the sales tax, Oregon has the lowest. The states that are lower than Oregon have a sales tax. When you add the sales tax to the beer tax the total is higher than Oregon." According to the Federation of Tax Administrators, a Washington, D.C., tax-research group, Monroe is correct when it comes to sales taxes. Oregon is one of nine states that does not have a sales tax. However, general sales taxes apply to most retail items, not just beer. We called Drenkard back to get his thoughts. "Sales taxes do affect the price of beer, but it’s not a beer-specific tax," he said, noting that 20 states do impose additional taxes pertaining specifically to malted beverages. "Then again, corporate taxes also affect the price of goods, including beer. Should we add those in as well? Where do you draw a line?" Oregon, according to a national group that tracks beer taxes, has one of the lowest such rates in the county. The 8-cents-a-gallon rate -- sixth-lowest nationally -- has remained unchanged since 1978. But Monroe claimed that Oregon has the lowest beer tax in the U.S. Later, he tried to justify that assertion by saying it’s the lowest if Oregon’s lack of a sales tax is taken into account. He didn’t make that specification in his original statement, though, and sales taxes aren’t specific to beer. We rate his claim False.

pomt-03759	Says "I've authored the first bipartisan tax reform bill in a quarter-century."	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2013/apr/06/ron-wyden/did-wyden-write-first-bipartisan-tax-reform-bill-2/	U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.,held a press event in Portland last week to promote a tax reform bill he’s co-authored with a Republican from Indiana. Wyden said that taxpayers now have to go through "bureaucratic water torture" to do their taxes. The rules are such a complicated mish-mash that many people need professional help to file their returns. "It simply doesn't have to be this way. I serve on the Senate Finance Committee. I've authored the first bipartisan tax reform bill in a quarter-century. This is with Sen. Dan Coats, the Republican from Indiana," Wyden said. The first bipartisan tax reform bill in 25 years? PolitiFact Oregon thought the statement a pretty bold claim to make. Don’t people elected to Congress like to write up laws? We started digging. The context: The last time the federal government overhauled the tax code was in 1986, when Republican Ronald Reagan was in office and the parties split control of Congress, much like today. Wyden, who was elected to Congress in 1980 and to the Senate in 1996, has talked often about the need to revisit the bipartisan spirit of that time. Wyden wants to simplify and streamline the tax code. He says he also wants to lower the burden on families and small businesses. Wyden first proposed an overhaul in 2010, pairing with Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H. After Gregg left office, Wyden partnered with Coats in 2011 and plans to introduce the legislation again this year. The analysis: We asked Tom Towslee, a Wyden spokesman, to back up the senator’s assertion. Towslee said the office had checked with the Congressional Research Service, the body’s nonpartisan research arm, and was told of a 1995 plan sponsored by Sens. Sam Nunn, D-Ga, and Pete Domenici, R-N.M. That plan would have replaced the income tax with a consumption tax, which Towslee said is not the same as a comprehensive reform plan. "I think you’ll agree that reforming the current income tax code to make it fairer, simpler and more efficient is very different from replacing it outright with something else," he said. We turned to the Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C., think tank. President Scott Hodge checked with his staff and they also came upon the Domenici-Nunn "USA Tax Act" of 1995. (Tax bills in 1990, 1997, 2001, 2002 and 2003 may have had some crossover appeal, but these were bills to raise and lower tax rates, and not to address the tax code in a comprehensive way.) "It may be a stretch, but not a big one," Hodge said of Wyden’s claim. "What Wyden cares about is re-creating the bipartisanship that brought about the 1986 bill. He may not be the first, but he is in small company." We checked a database of Congressional bills. We found numerous bills, often introduced over multiple sessions, for a flat tax or for a fair share tax, sponsored by Democrats or Republicans, but not both. We also found several efforts to do away with the Internal Revenue Service, some with a Democrat or two on board with Republicans. For example, H.R. 352, introduced in January, is a four-page document that terminates the IRS Code of 1986 in Section 2 and calls for a new federal tax system in Section 3. It is skimpy on details. We also caught up with Jane Gravelle, the senior specialist at Congressional Research Service who assisted Wyden’s office. She’s been there 40 years, done tons of research in the area and could not locate legislation similar to the 1986 effort other than Wyden’s. She does not consider the Nunn-Domenici effort a general income tax reform bill on par with Wyden’s bill. "I would also add that formulating and actually putting a major tax reform bill into legislative language is a major undertaking, not something that can be done easily and quickly," she said in an email. Indeed, Wyden’s bill runs 120 pages. Apparently we were mistaken in thinking that lawmakers like to draft lengthy, complicated legislation on the tax code. The bills are rare. The ruling: Some politicians call the tinkering of tax rates "tax reform." We don’t buy that. Some people consider the Nunn-Domenici bill of 1995 a bipartisan tax reform bill. We can see why Wyden’s office, with back-up from the research service, would differentiate his plan from their plan. Still, the 1995 effort merits a mention as additional information missing from an otherwise accurate statement. We rule the statement Mostly True.

pomt-04788	Says Obama puts "15 unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats in charge of Medicare, who are required to cut Medicare ... that will lead to denied care for current seniors."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/aug/23/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-said-15-unelected-unaccountable-bureaucr/	Remember the discredited Republican attack that President Barack Obama’s health care law created a "rationing board" or "death panel"? It’s back — but with a softer edge. And it’s coming from the architect of the lightning-rod Republican plan to turn Medicare into a program that pays for private insurance. Vice presidential hopeful Paul Ryan claims an "unelected, unaccountable" board created by the health care law "will lead to denied care for current seniors." His language is more measured than other claims we’ve weighed over the years about Medicare’s new Independent Payment Advisory Board. But did he reach the truth? Ryan trotted out the campaign line (and his Medicare-eligible mother, Betty) on Aug. 18, 2012, in retiree-heavy Florida community The Villages, and repeated it two days later in New Hampshire. "Here's what the president won't tell you about his Medicare plan, about Obamacare," he said. "The president raids $716 billion from the Medicare program to pay for the Obamacare program. What's more, in addition to that, he puts a board of 15 unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats in charge of Medicare, who are required to cut Medicare in ways that will lead to denied care for current seniors." We’ve evaluated versions of the $716 billion claim, finding that the amount wasn’t "raided" or "robbed" but that the law reduces future spending through a series of cost-saving measures. (Meanwhile, Ryan’s own House budget took advantage of the same savings he attacks.) Here we’re checking Ryan’s comments about the Independent Payment Advisory Board. ‘Unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats’ The Independent Payment Advisory Board, slated to start work in 2013, was created by the health care law to put distance between politics and Medicare. (An evenhanded report from the Kaiser Family Foundation describes the board and its origin.) Its 15 full-time members aren’t elected. But that doesn’t mean they’re unaccountable. • They’re appointed by the president and approved by the Senate. • They can’t serve more than two six-year terms. • Their recommendations can be rejected by Congress. • They must follow disclosure and ethics guidelines, and they can’t perform other jobs as they serve. • They can be removed by the president for "neglect of duty" or "malfeasance in office," though not for any other reason. Henry Aaron, an economist who specializes in health care and tax policy at the Brookings Institution, says they’re accountable in the same sense that members of any federal regulatory commission are accountable — they serve fixed terms and can be removed for cause. But Gail Wilensky, a health economist who directed the Medicare and Medicaid programs from 1990 to 1992 under President George H.W. Bush, argues that all members of independent commissions, once appointed and confirmed "are almost impossible to move or influence." By contrast, she says, other types of presidential appointees, such as Cabinet members, can be pressured to resign if they make serious mistakes. In addition to limiting the reasons a board member might be removed, lawmakers sought to insulate the board’s decisions from special-interest lobbying. • Its recommendations are fast-tracked in Congress and go into effect automatically if lawmakers fail to act. • Implementation of its recommendations isn’t subject to administrative or judicial review. So, board members aren’t elected, but while their decisions are protected by law, they are to some degree accountable. In particular, they could fail to win a second term, or get fired by the president. Are they bureaucrats? They become members of the bureaucracy by definition once they join the board. But they won’t all start that way. The law specifies that members will represent a mix of different professions, from health finance and economics to health facility management to medicine. In other words, the same kind of people who might advise health care spending decisions outside of government. ‘Required to cut Medicare’ If Medicare grows too quickly, the Independent Payment Advisory Board is required to recommend cuts. But it won’t have as large an impact as you might imagine. Obama’s health care law, the Affordable Care Act, reduces Medicare’s growth by more than $700 billion over the next 10 years, as we noted above. How much savings will the board generate? Less than 4 percent of net Medicare savings in the law’s first decade, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Recommendations from the board probably wouldn’t be necessary after that, according to Medicare’s actuary. That’s because it only has to recommend cuts in years that Medicare misses its growth targets. After 2019, other savings in the health care law, if allowed to take effect, would keep the program in check. So it’s fair to say the bulk of the savings in the law are outside the board’s purview. It’s only if those other measures fail to keep Medicare spending on track that the board is required to recommend additional ways to save. Meanwhile, if Congress comes up with another way to achieve the savings, it could overrule the board’s proposals. ‘Denied care’ Ryan said the board would "cut Medicare in ways that will lead to denied care for current seniors." But by law, the board can’t ration care. It can’t change benefits. It can’t change eligibility. It can’t increase what seniors pay. So it’s expected to cut payments to providers. That could be a problem, since some providers say they’re underpaid already. New York Times and USA Today stories in 2009 and 2010, for example, feature doctors opting out of Medicare because of its low payment rates. How might that affect care? Imagine, say critics, being unable to find a nearby hospital or doctor who takes Medicare. Or discovering that payments for a particular service or procedure have been reduced. "In that way, at least in theory, you could get actual denial of care," said Michael Tanner, a health care analyst for the libertarian Cato Institute, who opposes the health care law. The Medicare actuary, Richard Foster, estimated that savings from the entire health care law would make about 15 percent of hospitals, skilled nursing facilities and home health agencies unprofitable by 2019. That means, presumably, that to stay open they would need to shift costs to non-Medicare patients, merge with other providers or withdraw from Medicare, he said. That’s one reason he’s testified that growth reduction under the law isn’t sustainable in the long range. It’s "a serious issue," said Wilensky, the Bush-era Medicare official. But that’s the projected effect for the entire law. Meanwhile, the board itself is required to consider "to the extent feasible" how its recommendations would affect access to care, especially in rural and other underserved areas. Our ruling Ryan said that Obama "puts a board of 15 unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats in charge of Medicare who are required to cut Medicare in ways that will lead to denied care for current seniors." Board members aren’t elected, but it’s a stretch to say they’re entirely unaccountable. They’re appointed by the president and approved by the Senate. The president can fire them for neglect of duty or malfeasance.They’re required to recommend cuts to Medicare in years that other cost-saving measures don’t meet growth targets — but Congress can overrule their recommendations. Meanwhile, "denied care" is a strong way to phrase the board’s possible effect. It’s expected to recommend cutting provider payments, with an eye on cutting waste and inefficiency. That could restrict some seniors’ access to care, depending on the what actions the board actually takes. Meanwhile, the board oversees only a small percentage of the Medicare savings in the health care law. Ryan creates the specter of an unaccountable board making all of Medicare’s spending decisions, but that’s scarcely the case. There’s an element of truth to his claim, but his overstatements add up to a Mostly False impression.	None	Paul Ryan	None	None	None	2012-08-23T14:40:20	2012-08-18	['Medicare_(United_States)']
pomt-10167	McCain "said the other day that he would not meet potentially with the prime minister of Spain, because he . . . wasn't sure whether they were aligned with us."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/29/barack-obama/yes-wary-about-spain-and-maybe-confused-too/	During the first presidential debate, Barack Obama said John McCain has been too reluctant to support high-level diplomacy with other nations. Obama said that was true not just with U.S. enemies such as Iran, but also with a longtime ally like Spain. Obama said that McCain "even said the other day that he would not meet potentially with the prime minister of Spain, because he — you know, he wasn't sure whether they were aligned with us," Obama said. "I mean, Spain? Spain is a NATO ally." Obama was referring to an interview McCain gave with Radio Caracol in Miami on Sept. 17 in which McCain was asked if he would invite José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, the Spanish prime minister, to the White House. McCain's tangled and somewhat confused response prompted lots of criticism. Democrats said it illustrated reluctance by the Bush administration — and now McCain — to engage in diplomacy even with longtime allies. Here's the relevant portion of the interview: Q: Senator, finally, let’s talk about Spain. If you’re elected president, would you be willing to invite President José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero to the White House, to meet with you? A: I would be willing to meet with those leaders who are our friends and want to work with us in a cooperative fashion. And by the way, President Calderón of Mexico is fighting a very, very tough fight against the drug cartels. I’m glad we’re now working in cooperation with the Mexican government on the Merida plan, and I intend to move forward with the relations and invite as many of them as I can of those leaders to the White House. Q: Would that invitation be extended to the Zapatero government? To the president, itself? A: Uh, I don’t, you know, honestly, I have to look at the relations and the situations and the priorities, but I can assure you: I will establish closer relations with our friends, and I will stand up to those who want to do harm to the United States of America. I know how to do both. Q: So, you have to wait and see if he’s willing to, to meet with you, or you be… able to do it? In the White House? A: Well, again… I, I don’t… All I can tell you is that I have a clear record of working with leaders in the hemisphere that are friends with us, and standing up to those who are not, and that’s judged on the basis of the importance of our relationship with Latin America, and the entire region. Q: OK, what about Europe? I’m talking about the President of Spain. Are you willing to meet with him, if you’re elected president? A: I’m willing to meet with any leader who is dedicated to the same principles and philosophy that we are for human rights, democracy and freedom. And I will stand up to those that do not. McCain's reluctance to meet with Zapatero was odd because Spain is a member of NATO and a longtime U.S. ally. The CIA World Factbook calls it "a global champion of freedom." The U.S. State Department says "Spain and the United States have a long history of official relations and are closely associated in many fields." But it's worth noting that U.S.-Spain relations have suffered since Zapatero became prime minister in 2004 and withdrew Spanish troops that were helping the U.S. war in Iraq. We listened to the McCain interview several times and got the impression that the senator was confused during the first few questions. The interviewer says Zapatero's name quickly and it seemed to us that McCain did not recognize the name. His answer suggests he is focused on other leaders from Latin America. But the interviewer seems to notice his confusion and reminds him "OK, what about Europe? I’m talking about the president of Spain." But McCain's reply does not suggest that registered with him and he offers a more general reply about meeting with "any leader who is dedicated to the same principles and philosophy that we are." We would have accepted a McCain-was-confused explanation for this one, but the McCain campaign sent reporters a statement from foreign policy adviser Randy Scheunemann that said McCain's answer was intentional. "The questioner asked several times about Senator McCain's willingness to meet Zapatero — and id'd him in the question so there is no doubt Senator McCain knew exactly to whom the question referred. Senator McCain refused to commit to a White House meeting with President Zapatero in this interview," Scheunemann said in an e-mail sent to the Washington Post and CNN. Scheunemann said that if elected, McCain "will meet with a wide range of allies in a wide variety of venues but is not going to spell out scheduling and meeting location specifics in advance." So where does that leave us? Obama is right that McCain "said the other day that he would not meet potentially with the prime minister of Spain." McCain's words make that clear and are reinforced by Scheunemann's statement. It's less clear if McCain "wasn't sure whether (Spain is) aligned with us." To us, McCain seemed confused. But Scheunemann's statement is adamant that McCain knew the subject was Spain. As a result, his comment that "I have to look at the relations and the situations and the priorities" indicates at least some doubt about U.S.-Spanish relations. So we find Obama's claim to be Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-09-29T00:00:00	2008-09-26	['Spain']
pomt-09164	"My opponent in November of 2008 sent a missive to the White House, to President Obama-elect, and said, 'Here's how you need to sell cap-and-trade to the American people.' "	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2010/jun/08/rick-perry/gov-perry-says-democrat-bill-white-sent-president-/	On May 19 in Houston, Rick Perry revisited his objection to proposals to cap carbon emissions nationally, saying such a change would devastate the energy sector and the Texas economy, according to an online write-up by The Houston Chronicle. Referring to Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White, Perry said: "My opponent in November of 2008 sent a missive to the White House, to President Obama-elect, and said, 'Here's how you need to sell cap-and-trade to the American people.'" To date, there’s no evidence of White supporting the "cap-and-trade" scheme. So his advising the Democratic president-elect on how to sell the idea amounts to rich campaign fodder for Perry. Does Perry recap White's message to Obama accurately? Some background: Cap-and-trade plans typically try to ratchet down air pollution by making a set number of pollution allowances available to industry. Companies can trade or sell the allowances if their facilities pollute less than they’re allowed. The House passed a bill last year to start such a system, but the legislation has not advanced through the Senate. To our request for elaboration, Perry’s campaign pointed us to a Nov. 17, 2008 e-mail sent by White, then mayor of Houston, to Rahm Emanuel, who was slotted to become Obama’s chief of staff. The eight-paragraph e-mail, later noted by Perry's campaign in blog posts and an online video advertisement, surfaced on a Chronicle blog on May 18, 2010. White's campaign confirmed the e-mail's authenticity. Several times, White’s message to Emanuel, under the subject line "Energy Policy at the Beginning of an Administration," refers to the cap-and-trade possibility. Each mention advises against an early push. White’s e-mail says Obama should focus on "several high-impact objectives during his first year to make steady progress to meet energy policy goals while also stimulating the economy. But he should not try to do something ‘comprehensive’ on domestic carbon emissions until these tools are in place." Later, the e-mail says: "Avoid during 2009 wading into the mire of cap-and-trade or user taxes on carbon before the new Administration and Congress has made progress" on White’s energy-related recommendations. White’s e-mail says: "A carbon-based tax or sales (scheme) could be characterized as intrusive government increasing costs or simply another scheme to extract money from the public unless there is a clear ‘path forward’ on (a) transportation fuel efficiency; (b) efficiency of electrical power use; and (c) affordable clean power alternatives." The message continues: "The public can understand why we need to lower energy costs, reduce emissions, and cut imports. We can accomplish that goal while reducing carbon emissions. But do not allow the concept of reducing carbon emissions to drive this process. Lowering energy bills with clean domestic energy is a much better approach." White’s recommended to-do’s? His e-mail says Obama should accelerate the use of vehicles that use 40 miles per gallon or more. More advice: fund a program to retrofit 1 million homes and apartments occupied by low-income residents. And, he writes, Obama should encourage new power plants to use cleaner-than-coal natural gas, among steps. White’s campaign spokeswoman, Katy Bacon, said White referred to the cap-and-trade prospect because the idea was debated during the 2008 election year. In his campaign, Obama committed to creating a cap-and-trade system — a promise that PolitiFact has lately rated "in the works." Next, we contacted an Austin advertising firm to get another take on whether White's e-mail reads like advice on how to sell cap and trade, as Perry puts it. Patrick Cline, a partner at JH&A Advertising, credited White's message with couching in step with an understanding that a cap-and-trade plan could wreak havoc with the state's petrochemical plants. But, Cline said, White's note stops short of being a primer on selling cap and trade to the American people. Our conclusion: White's e-mail is not close to the "how-to" guide Perry claims. Indeed, White's message urges the incoming administration not to push a carbon emissions proposal until after it has advanced other energy-related ideas. Nowhere does the e-mail offer guidance on pitching cap and trade. Perry floats a politically potent but inaccurate, ridiculous characterization. Pants on Fire!

pomt-06765	Outside of recall elections, "there's never been a public official removed from office" in Wisconsin "for anything but malfeasance in office."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/aug/21/bob-ryan/sheboygan-mayor-bob-ryan-says-no-public-official-w/	Defiant Sheboygan Mayor Bob Ryan-- whose drinking problems have spurred scorn from citizens, humiliation on YouTube and ridicule from Jay Leno -- says he would become a singular figure in the history of Wisconsin government if his Common Council succeeds in removing him from office. Wisconsin witnessed a historic set of nine recall elections in the summer of 2011. Voters removed two Republican state senators from office. But Ryan, whose city calls itself the bratwurst capital of the world, claims his removal would be unique -- partly because it would not involve a recall. On Aug. 15, 2011, the Sheboygan Common Council launched a process that could eventually take Ryan, who has resisted calls to resign, out of office. If the move plays out, Ryan essentially would be put on trial with the council acting as judge and jury, according to a Sheboygan Press article and Sheboygan City Attorney Steve McLean. Ryan made his claim to aldermen during the Aug. 15 council meeting, according to WBAY-TV in Green Bay. "This whole thing stinks. If you want to take me out of office, by all means start your recall," he said. "If you want to go down this path, it's not a threat, it's a fact, it's never been done. There's never been a public official removed from office in this state for anything but malfeasance in office. I'm here to do a job. I will continue to do that job. You should know by now, I never quit. Ever." For us, the key claim is this sentence: "There's never been a public official removed from office in this state for anything but malfeasance in office." Never is a long time. Ryan didn’t return our call and emails over two days asking him to clarify his claim and to provide evidence for it. "Public official," for example, could mean an elected official or an appointed one, such as a school superintendent. But our sense is Ryan was referring to elected officials like himself being removed by a governmental body, and not the voters. Ryan has argued that his drinking -- he has admitted to being an alcoholic -- has not affected his duties as mayor. The saga in Sheboygan, a Lake Michigan community of about 50,000 people 60 miles north of Milwaukee, began in September 2009, six months after Ryan, 48, was elected mayor. He called a news conference to apologize for making a sexually explicit remark about his wife’s sister. Ryan’s remark was captured on video, posted on YouTube, became fodder for Jay Leno and led the Common Council to censure him. The drama intensified in July 2011, when news surfaced that Ryan was issued a warning by police after a weekend of drinking at taverns in Elkhart Lake, becoming rude and obnoxious and passing out at least once. The Common Council voted to begin the removal process after Ryan refused its call to resign. To see whether Ryan’s claim is correct, we contacted a number of experts. They include state government entities -- the Legislative Reference Bureau, the Historical Society, the Department of Public Instruction and the Judicial Commission; statewide associations -- the League of Municipalities, the Counties Association and the Association of School Boards; political scientists -- Dennis Dresang of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Joe Heim of the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse; and Milwaukee historian John Gurda. Here’s what we found: Fatal shooting: In 1842, six years before Wisconsin became a state, James Vineyard, a member of the Territorial Legislature’s version of the state Senate, shot and killed fellow member Charles C.P. Arndt during an argument after a legislative session adjourned. Vineyard was expelled from the legislature after it refused to accept his resignation, although he was acquitted of manslaughter at trial, according to the Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau and the Wisconsin Historical Society. Given that the shooting occurred on the legislative floor, it could be fairly argued that the removal was related to misconduct in office. So, that one does not directly undercut Ryan’s claim. Felony crimes: At least four state lawmakers have been removed from office after being convicted of a felony. But under state law, the expulsions were automatic -- no action needed to be taken by the Legislature -- so that makes their removals different than Ryan’s would be. Crimes not directly related to official duties also have led to removals that were not automatic. For example, the New Holstein School Board fired Christopher J. Nelson, the district’s superintendent, after he was charged in February 2011 with trying to set up a sexual encounter with a person he thought was a 15-year-old boy. That could undercut Ryan’s claim, but Nelson was an appointed official, not elected. Non-criminal removal: In 1992, the state Supreme Court removed Racine County Circuit Court Judge Jon Skow from the bench after he admitted he was permanently disabled from stress and depression. The high court determined that Skow, who suffered from alcoholism, could not carry out his duties. He previously had been suspended following a number of incidents, including leaving the bench during a trial. That case does undercut Ryan’s claim, since the judge was not removed for malfeasance in office. As rare as removals from office appear to be, at least two other Wisconsin mayors have been targeted for removal since 2008. The Common Council in Montello, 60 miles north of Madison, removed Mayor Frank Breitenbach in August 2008 for reasons related to misconduct in office, according to the Wisconsin State Journal. He faced 15 allegations by city employees and residents, including using profanity with employees and threatening to fire Montello's police chief without legal authority. In Marinette, a Lake Michigan community 120 miles north of Sheboygan, a Common Council committee recommended hiring a special prosecutor in an effort to remove Mayor Robert Harbick from office. Harbick had pleaded no contest to first-offense drunken-driving, which is a traffic violation in Wisconsin. But the removal process failed to proceed when the proposal to hire the attorney failed in a 4-4 vote before the full council in August 2011. Let’s review what we’ve found. The embattled Sheboygan mayor said no public official in Wisconsin has ever been removed from office "for anything but malfeasance in office." Ryan’s reference was not to recall elections or automatic removal, but removal by a governmental body such as a city council. Our sense is it’s likely the mayor was speaking of elected officials, and we could find only one instance, involving a judge, in which a removal was not for misconduct in office. We also found a school superintendent fired by a school board following the filing of criminal charges, but he did not hold an elected position. This is a statement we could revisit if more information surfaces; after all we’re talking about more than 150 years of history and countless governmental entities in Wisconsin. For now, we feel Ryan’s statement needs a little clarification, but is essentially accurate -- our definition of Mostly True.	None	Bob Ryan	None	None	None	2011-08-21T09:00:00	2011-08-15	['Wisconsin']
pomt-11144	"It’s against the law in Texas to let any loaded gun get in the hands of a child."	true	/texas/statements/2018/may/30/dan-patrick/texas-law-bars-adults-leaving-loaded-guns-accessib/	Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick told a national TV audience after the May 2018 Santa Fe High School shootings that he doesn’t see a need for more gun regulation in that Texas already bars children from having loaded weapons. We decided to check Patrick's reference to law given that the admitted Santa Fe shooter reportedly used his father’s shotgun and handgun in the attack. Our research identified the 1995 law, though we also learned it wouldn’t apply to the Santa Fe incident due to the shooter’s age of 17. Patrick, taking questions from George Stephanopoulos on the May 20, 2017, edition of ABC's This Week, said: "We have to look at ourselves, George. It’s not about the guns. It’s about us. Can there be gun regulation? "Gun control, I believe, starts at home, George. Every person who owns a gun must be accountable for their guns at home," Patrick said. "We don’t know all the facts yet. But this particular young man got his guns in some way from his parents’ home. You should have your guns locked up. It’s against the law in Texas to let any loaded gun get in the hands of a child, for example." Law confirmed Our online search for such a law led us to a web page about preventing Texas children from getting guns created by the San Francisco-based Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. That page says Texas has a law holding a person criminally liable if he or she, "with criminal negligence," fails to secure a "readily dischargeable" firearm and a child under age 17 gains access to it. Next, we turned to section 46.13 of the Texas penal code, titled "Making a Firearm Accessible to a Child," which defines a readily dischargeable firearm as one "loaded with ammunition, whether or not a round is in the chamber." The law states: "A person commits an offense if a child gains access to a readily dischargeable firearm and the person with criminal negligence: (1) failed to secure the firearm; or (2) left the firearm in a place to which the person knew or should have known the child would gain access." Under the law, "secure" means "to take steps that a reasonable person would take to prevent the access to a readily dischargeable firearm by a child, including but not limited to placing a firearm in a locked container or temporarily rendering the firearm inoperable by a trigger lock or other means." The law otherwise provides defenses to prosecution starting with whether the child’s access was supervised by a person older than 18 and the firearm was for hunting, sporting "or other lawful purposes." Under the law, a violation is a Class C misdemeanor or a Class A misdemeanor "if the child discharges the firearm and causes death or serious bodily injury to himself or another person." Legislative history Legislative records show the legislation creating the law won approval in 1995, the same year that then-state Sen. Jerry Patterson, R-Pasadena, shepherded into law the state's concealed-carry measure. We connected with Patterson, who told us by email that the child-specific proposal, initiated by Rep. Al Edwards, D-Houston, had momentum that year in part due to testimony by a Houston couple who had lost their son to an accidental shooting. The boy’s mother, Linda Tarr, testified at the time: "This bill is to save children. It is not a gun-control bill. This is a gun-responsibility act, and children are our responsibility.'' Effective law? We also wondered about the law’s effects. The April 1995 Austin American-Statesman news story where we spotted Tarr’s testimony said that in 1993, 42 children younger than 17 had been killed in accidents involving firearms. There have lately been fewer such deaths, according to figures we requested from the Texas Department of State Health Services. Spokesman Chris Van Deusen emailed us a chart indicating that in 2014-15, 11 Texas children younger than 17 were killed in accidents involving firearms. Separately, Ari Freilich, a lawyer for the Giffords center, said by email that Texas is among 27 states with child access prevention laws potentially making adults legally accountable for letting minors gain unsupervised access to guns. But Freilich called the Texas law weaker than laws in some states because it only applies to adults who leave readily operable loaded firearms accessible to unsupervised minors. "As a result, Texas' law would likely not apply even if an adult left an unsupervised minor home alone with an unloaded firearm out on the table right next to a box of ammunition," Freilich wrote. Also, Freilich said, the Texas law wouldn't apply to what evidently happened at Santa Fe High School because the admitted shooter was 17--and the law applies only to guns taken by minors 16 or younger. After the Santa Fe shootings, the center posted a memo to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott stating the law should be amended, at the least, to apply to minors under 18 "and to cases where an adult leaves unloaded firearms and ammunition accessible to the minor." We also asked the NRA-tied Texas State Rifle Association about the law. By phone, Alice Gene Tripp praised it, saying: "It doesn’t try to criminalize how you store your guns. It simply puts a penalty in statute if you don’t do it effectively. Texas allows adults to make adult decisions and penalizes those who don’t do it correctly." Our ruling Patrick said: "It’s against the law in Texas to let any loaded gun get in the hands of a child." A 1995 state law makes it a misdemeanor if a person with criminal negligence fails to secure a loaded gun and a child younger than 17 accesses it or if a person leaves the gun where he or she knew or should have known the child would get it.

pomt-11059	"Migrant mother and ‘crying girl’ on Time cover never separated."	true	/punditfact/statements/2018/jun/25/gateway-pundit/immigrant-girl-time-cover-wasnt-separated-mother/	A Time magazine cover photo of a young immigrant girl sobbing as she looked up at President Donald Trump became a symbol of the criticism over Trump’s immigration policies, but the iconic image was misleading. Several headlines on Facebook challenged the image, including this headline by The Gateway Pundit which largely drew from an article by The Daily Mail. "Shock: Migrant mother and ‘crying girl’ on Time cover never separated; mom deported in 2013, left husband with good job, 3 other kids, paid coyote $6k to sneak back in U.S." Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The photo of the Honduran girl in McAllen Texas was taken by John Moore, a Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer for Getty Images. Moore joined a Border Patrol agent, Carlos Ruiz, for a ride along on the border June 12. Moore took a photo of the girl crying next to her mother when they were detained by federal agents near the U.S.-Mexico border, and the cutline distributed by Getty said that the mother and her daughter were detained "before being sent to a processing center for possible separation." Time then created a photo illustration using the image of the crying girl and a photo of Trump with the headline "Welcome to America." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com (Cover image of Time used with permission) The photo came to symbolize Trump’s since-reversed policy that led to separating immigrant children from their parents at the border. But it also came to symbolize how viral images on social media can be used to create misleading impressions. The girl’s father, Denis Javier Varela Hernandez, told reporters that the girl and her mother have been detained together and were not separated. Honduran deputy foreign minister Nelly Jerez confirmed Valera’s version of events to Reuters. In an interview with CBS News, Ruiz said agents asked the mother, Sandra Sanchez, to put down her daughter, nearly 2-year-old Yanela, so they could search the mother. "I personally went up to the mother and asked her, 'Are you doing okay? Is the kid okay?' and she said, 'Yes. She's tired and thirsty. It's 11 o'clock at night," Ruiz told CBS News. Ruiz said the image was misleading. "They’re using it to symbolize a policy, and that was not the case in this picture," Ruiz said. "It took less than two minutes. As soon as the search was finished, she immediately picked the girl up, and the girl immediately stopped crying." Time interviewed Moore about taking the photographs at the border. Time posted a correction to that story June 19: "The original version of this story misstated what happened to the girl in the photo after she was taken from the scene. The girl was not carried away screaming by U.S. Border Patrol agents; her mother picked her up and the two were taken away together." However, Time stood by the cover story. "The June 12 photograph of the 2-year-old Honduran girl became the most visible symbol of the ongoing immigration debate in America for a reason: Under the policy enforced by the administration, prior to its reversal this week, those who crossed the border illegally were criminally prosecuted, which in turn resulted in the separation of children and parents. Our cover and our reporting capture the stakes of this moment," Time's editor-in-chief Edward Felsenthal said in a statement to CNN published June 22. Moore told the Washington Post that Time corrected the story after he made a request minutes after it was published. He said that the picture "is a straightforward and honest image" showing a "distressed little girl" whose mother was being searched by border officials. Moore said on Instagram that the girl and mother were taken into custody together and held at a detention center in Dilley, Texas. Immigration and Customs Enforcement released a statement to the media that said Sanchez, 32, was arrested by border patrol on June 12 near Hidalgo, Texas. On June 17, 2018, Sanchez was transferred to ICE custody, and is currently housed at the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas. Her immigration proceedings are ongoing. Our ruling A headline by The Gateway Pundit said "Migrant mother and ‘crying girl’ on Time cover never separated." A Getty photographer took a photo of a girl crying when her mother was detained by the Border Patrol. The girl’s father, as well as a Border Patrol agent, confirmed that the girl and her mother were not separated. The agent said they were separated for a few minutes while the mother was searched. Time published a correction in a story in which the photographer was interviewed stating that the girl was not carried away by agents and the two were taken away together. We rate this claim True.

pomt-04195	November 2012 was "a record year of turnout. More people voted before Election Day using absentee ballots and voting early than ever before in our history."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2012/dec/07/ken-detzner/florida-elections-chief-says-we-had-record-turnout/	A few days after the election, a CNN reporter asked Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner about long lines and other problems Florida had on Election Day: "How could this happen in 2012 in a state in the United States, that people would wait six hours and many would just abandon and not vote at all?" Detzner responded that there were two reasons for the long lines. First, Florida had a long ballot -- 11 constitutional amendments and in Miami-Dade, a slew of local amendments -- on top of the presidential election and local races. Second, he said, turnout "was unprecedented. It was a record year of turnout. More people voted before Election Day using absentee ballots and voting early than ever before in our history." Detzner identified some other issues throughout the interview, including that elections offices need to have sufficient equipment and the state needs more early voting locations. Was the Nov. 6, 2012, election in Florida a "record" for overall turnout? And did Florida also break a record of pre-election day voting? In mid-December, Detzner plans to make a fact-finding trip to five counties that had some long lines and other election problems, including Miami-Dade, where voters stood in line for as long as seven hours. Broward is also on that list -- the county found 963 ballots after Election Day, but the supervisor said that they weren’t actually "lost." Detzner will begin his road trip in Tampa, which performed well, as a benchmark before he visits the counties that had problems. Overall turnout Florida’s general election turnout was about 71.2 percent. This was no record. Statistics starting in 1954 show Florida general election turnout exceeded 71.2 percent 11 times: 1960, 1964, 1968, 1972, 1976, 1980, 1984, 1988, 1992, 2004 and 2008. The highest general election turnout was 83 percent in 1992 when Bill Clinton won his first presidential race. "Relatively speaking, Florida in 2012 moved backward when it came to voting," the Miami Herald wrote after the election. Detzner was referring to the sheer number of voters -- 8,491,920 -- not the percentage of voters who participated, said Chris Cate, Florida Department of State spokesman. That’s the highest number of voters who have ever participated. Cate said that "more total people cast a ballot, early or not, in this election than any previous Florida election." Looking at 1992 -- the year that had record-high turn-out -- Cate noted that about 5.3 million Floridians cast a ballot, which is about three million fewer than November 2012. This growth in the number of voters makes sense considering Florida's population growth. We looked up the numbers and found the state population was 13.7 million in 1992 but grew to 19 million in 2011 (the most recent data available). Early voting and absentee Florida began offering absentee ballots to everyone -- not just those who could prove they were out of town or in the military -- in 2002. The state began offering early voting in 2004. Let’s look at the breakdown for the types of votes cast in presidential general elections since the start of early voting: 2004 2008 2012 Absentee 1,352,447 1,850,502 2,358,638 Early 1,428,362 2,661,672 2,411,811 Absentee+Early 2,780,809 4,512,174 4,770,449 Total (Absentee+Early+Election Day) 7,640,319 8,456,329 8,491,920 Source: Florida Division of Elections (Note: Total reflects certified results.) In 2012, about 4.77 million Floridians cast ballots early or absentee, more than either 2008 or 2004. There was also a huge increase -- more than 1 million -- in early voting between 2004 and Barack Obama’s first presidential victory in 2008. Despite those large increases in early voting, a Republican-led state Legislature voted in 2011 to cut back the number of days for early voting. Republican Gov. Rick Scott refused to extend early voting in 2012. In response to the state’s decision to reduce early voting days, the Obama campaign encouraged supporters to vote with absentee ballots, which are typically mailed in but can also be dropped off in person at the supervisor of elections office. Detzner’s focus on sheer numbers rather than percentage We sent Detzner’s claim to several political science professors who study elections and asked whether it is more relevant to compare turnout percentages or raw numbers, particularly when examining why we had election problems and how to fix them. "In the end, it is the total number of people that show up that creates the lines and counting delays, not the percentage," University of Central Florida professor Aubrey Jewett wrote in an email to PolitiFact Florida. Given that state and local officials knew that record numbers of people had registered, they should have been prepared for record numbers of voters, Jewett said. "I shudder to think what things might have looked like if we actually had a record turnout percent this past election!" Our experts also said turnout numbers shouldn’t be used as an excuse for the long lines. The state Legislature was responsible for reducing early voting days, limiting early voting locations and for placing 11 amendments on the ballot. And decisions by local officials about spending, training, equipment and staffing also contributed to problems. "Overall, there is plenty of blame to go around for our voting problems at both the state and local level," Jewett said. Steven Tauber, a government professor at the University of South Florida, told PolitiFact Florida that he saw three main reasons for the long lines: "The primary reason is that the state was unprepared for the volume of voters, and they should have been. Clearly, the state did not provide enough resources to handle the election. The second point is that for no good reason, the state cut back on early voting. The third reason is that the state legislature unnecessarily loaded the ballot with needless, wordy amendments (most of which lost) that lengthened the amount of time it took people to vote." Susan MacManus, a University of Southern Florida professor, said that the more relevant information is what happened on a local level, in the counties that had the long lines or problems. "I don’t ever like to use aggregate statewide figures when you have concentrated areas of problems," she said. But turnout figures don’t provide much of a window on the problems in South Florida. In the state’s largest county in Miami-Dade, turnout dropped from about 70 percent in 2008 to about 67.6 percent in 2012. The number of voters increased slightly by about 16,000. In addition to the long ballot, the county faced a series of other problems that contributed to the lines, including a shortage of temporary workers and equipment, and the county’s decision to delay a plan to redraw precincts to avoid huge crowds where the population had swelled. Broward had an even bigger dip in turnout percentage but a similar increase in voters -- and again, that doesn’t explain problems, such as finding 963 ballots in the elections warehouse after Election Day. Broward Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes told the Sun-Sentinel that her office "got thrown off its game" with a lawsuit that allowed in-person absentee voting the Sunday and Monday before Election Day, days that were meant to prepare precincts and tabulate absentee ballots." Our ruling As he was grilled about Florida’s long lines, Detzner said, "The turnout was unprecedented. It was a record year of turnout. More people voted before Election Day using absentee ballots and voting early than ever before in our history." He’s right that the sheer number of voters was a record, at 8.5 million. Also, he's right that more people "than ever before" voted early or absentee. But it was not the highest turnout by percentage. At 71 percent, 2012 marked the 12th highest turnout since 1954.

pomt-02135	"A small majority of Americans don’t think they like the Affordable Care Act, but a large majority of Americans don’t want to do away with the protections that are in the Affordable Care Act."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/may/07/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-people-dont-health-care-law-i/	Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton isn’t saying yet whether she’s running for president in 2016 -- "I am somebody who has to really mull things over because there is a cost to everything," she said on May 6, 2014. Even so, Clinton remains very much in the public eye, including a May 6 keynote address to the National Council for Behavioral Health. In her remarks, Clinton voiced support for the Affordable Care Act and offered a nuanced take on the polling numbers. "There have been many complaints and concerns about the Affordable Care Act, but I’ve been struck by the polling I’ve been reading, because it tells the same story," she said. "A small majority of Americans don’t think they like the Affordable Care Act, but a large majority of Americans don’t want to do away with the protections that are in the Affordable Care Act. A small majority wants to repeal it, but that is slowly receding as a rising majority says, ‘No, fix it.’ This is the tradition of good, old-fashioned American pragmatism." We recently fact-checked Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., on the public’s support for repeal, which appears to have remained stable in recent months. And recent Kaiser Family Foundation polling shows that from March to April, the percentage of people who said they want improvements to the law jumped from 49 to 58. But what about Clinton’s claim that most Americans want to keep Affordable Care Act protections, even if they don’t like the law itself? Clinton didn’t return our request for comment, but we found her analysis to be on target. According to RealClearPolitics, a political news and commentary site that aggregates polls, an average of five polls found that 52.3 percent of voters expressed opposition to the health care law. That’s a small majority, just as Clinton said. Other surveys record smaller percentages, in the 35 percent to 45 percent range. What about her argument that Americans like specific protections in the law, even as they oppose the law as a whole? The Kaiser Family Foundation’s March 2014 report breaks down how voters feel about different components of the Affordable Care Act. A majority of Republicans, Democrats and independents favored 7 of the 11 elements Kaiser asked about in March. They are: Tax credits to small businesses to buy insurance: 88 percent support Close the Medicare "doughnut hole": 81 percent support Create health insurance exchanges: 80 percent support Extend dependent coverage: 76 percent support Subsidy assistance to individuals: 76 percent support Guaranteed issue of insurance policies: 66 percent support Penalties for insurers who spend too little on medical care: 65 percent support On an additional three elements of the law, a majority of Americans expressed support, but only a minority of Republicans: Medicaid expansion: 71 percent An increase in the Medicare payroll tax for upper income earners: 60 percent The employer mandate: 57 percent So on 10 of the 11 elements, substantial majorities of Americans expressed support, justifying Clinton’s claim that "a large majority of Americans" support individual elements of the law. But there was one exception: The individual mandate, one of the cornerstones of the law. It attracted the support of only 40 percent of Americans -- 55 percent of Democrats, 39 percent of independents and 21 percent of Republicans. Our ruling Clinton said, "A small majority of Americans don’t think they like the Affordable Care Act, but a large majority of Americans don’t want to do away with the protections that are in the Affordable Care Act." An average of recent polls shows that just over 50 percent of Americans favor repealing the law. And a recent Kaiser study shows that "large majorities" of Americans favor 10 of the 11 elements of the law the pollsters asked about. However, Americans do oppose one crucial element of the law -- the individual mandate. That's something Clinton's comment glosses over, so we rate her claim Mostly True.

pomt-14009	Says Donald Trump "says he has foreign policy experience because he ran the Miss Universe pageant in Russia."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/03/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-donald-trump-cited-miss-unive/	During a forceful, even mocking address on foreign policy, Hillary Clinton lit into some of Donald Trump’s past comments -- including one in which he recalled the time he held the Miss Universe pageant in Russia in 2013. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, "says he has foreign policy experience because he ran the Miss Universe pageant in Russia," Clinton said during her address on June 2, 2016. Is that correct? We found that the attack is pretty close to the mark, though somewhat overstated. Clinton’s barb stemmed from an interview Trump did with Fox News’ Bret Baier on May 6, 2016. At one point in the interview -- around the 16:40 mark here -- Baier asked Trump about whether he had ever met Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, which is an issue Trump had been coy about in previous interviews. Trump told Baier that once again he would have no comment on the question, in order to protect Putin’s confidences. Trump went on to say, however, "I know Russia well. I had a major event in Russia two or three years ago, Miss Universe contest, which was a big, big, incredible event. An incredible success." (Trump sold the pageant in 2015.) We won’t gauge whether experience putting on a beauty pageant can give someone important foreign-policy insights -- something Clinton was clearly skeptical of during her speech. But it is true that Trump mounted the event in Russia in 2013. (As Politico’s Michael Crowley reported, Trump "watched 86 contestants don shimmering evening gowns and skimpy swimsuits for what he would call ‘the world’s biggest and most iconic beauty contest.’ ") So Clinton certainly has a point that Trump referenced his leadership of the Miss Universe pageant as a credential, and we didn’t notice any subsequent efforts by Trump to backtrack on what he said. However, Clinton overstated the case modestly when she accused Trump of claiming the pageant as "foreign policy experience." Trump definitely cited his pageant experience as evidence that he could work with Russia and Putin -- but the discussion with Baier never broadened out to foreign policy generally. Later in the exchange, for instance, he said that "they (Russia) want to be friendly with the United States ... (but) they really dislike Obama." So Trump didn’t say that the pageant helped him understand foreign policy overall. But he did say that it would help him get along with Russia. Our ruling Clinton said that Trump "says he has foreign policy experience because he ran the Miss Universe pageant in Russia." Trump did cite that as evidence of how he could navigate a relationship with Russia and work with its president, Putin, but he didn’t go so far as to say it bolstered his foreign policy experience more generally.

pomt-06124	Says Newt Gingrich "supports amnesty for illegal immigrants."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/27/restore-our-future/pro-romney-super-pac-says-new-gingrich-supports-am/	A pro-Mitt Romney "super PAC" is flexing its muscles in the race for the Republican presidential nomination, telling conservative voters not to fall for President Barack Obama’s plan to diminish Romney. The group, called Restore our Future, is running television ads in Iowa and Florida. "Barack Obama’s plan is working: Destroy Mitt Romney, run against Newt Gingrich," the ad says. "Newt has a ton of baggage. He was fined $300,000 for ethics violations and took $1.6 million from Freddie Mac, before it helped cause the economic meltdown. Newt supports amnesty for illegal immigrants, and teamed with Nancy Pelosi and Al Gore on global warming. Maybe that’s why George Will calls him the least conservative candidate. Check the facts at NewtFacts.com." Super PACs aren’t formally affiliated with campaigns, but they can still spend money to try to influence elections, and they don’t face the same disclosure requirements as official campaigns. In this case, Restore our Future is run by supporters of Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts. The ad makes a lot of claims. Here, we wanted to check whether Gingrich "supports amnesty for illegal immigrants." We looked into Gingrich’s position on amnesty when we fact-checked comments Romney made on Nov. 23, 2011. Romney said Gingrich’s immigration plan offered "a new doorway to amnesty." We rated that Mostly True. And in fact, the Restore Our Future ad cites that fact-check as evidence to support its claim. But the wording in this ad is slightly different. To examine it, we’ll review Gingrich’s positions on illegal immigration and amnesty, then we’ll see how that record compares with the ad’s statement. Merriam Webster defines amnesty as "the act of an authority (as a government) by which pardon is granted to a large group of individuals." In recent American politics, though, the usual standard for amnesty is the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. That law, supported by President Ronald Reagan, said that illegal immigrants could become legal permanent residents if they could prove they were in this country by Jan. 1, 1982, and met a few other minimal requirements. The law was widely described as an "amnesty" program, both then and now. Gingrich’s vision for immigration policy is that it takes place in steps, with the first step of securing the border between the U.S. and Mexico. He also supports a program for guest workers, to allow foreign nationals into the United States to work. Finally, some illegal immigrants would be allowed to stay. "Once you've put every piece in place, which includes the guest worker program, you need something like a World War II Selective Service Board that, frankly, reviews the people who are here," Gingrich said at a debate on Nov. 22, 2011. "If you've come here recently, you have no ties to this country, you ought to go home, period. If you've been here 25 years and you got three kids and two grandkids, you've been paying taxes and obeying the law, (and) you belong to a local church, I don't think we're going to separate you from your family, uproot you forcefully and kick you out. "The Krieble Foundation has a very good red card program that says you get to be legal, but you don't get a pass to citizenship. And so there's a way to ultimately end up with a country where there's no more illegality, but you haven't automatically given amnesty to anyone." Gingrich sets a higher bar for allowing people to stay than the law under Reagan. Based on his comments at the debate and a detailed 10-point plan on his website, Gingrich says his proposal isn’t amnesty for several reasons: It is not citizenship but legal residency; immigrants would have to prove "deep ties to America, including family, church and community ties"; and they would pay a fine of at least $5,000. In the course of our research, we noticed that advocates for more legal immigration often used this distinction. In their view, amnesty means widespread legalization with few requirements. A path to legality or earned legalization, on the other hand, includes fines, waiting periods, proof of English language proficiency, criminal background checks and other criteria. Romney, on the other hand, has defined amnesty as giving any kind of special preference to people who are now in the country illegally. "My view is that those people who have waited in line patiently to come to this country legally should be ahead in line, and those who’ve come here illegally should not be given a special deal or a special accelerated right to become a permanent resident or citizen," Romney said the day after the debate. Those who oppose more immigration tend to agree with Romney. "Anything that turns an illegal resident into a legal resident one way or another is an amnesty," said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports low levels of immigration, when we asked him about this for our earlier check. After the debate, Krikorian scolded Gingrich in a blog post on the National Review Online for claiming his plan wasn’t amnesty: "If you want to make a case for amnestying long-established illegal aliens, that can be an honorable position, but call it for what it is. Don’t lie to voters, imagining they’re too stupid to see through your deceit." On the other side of the issue is Tamar Jacoby of ImmigrationWorks USA, which represents businesses that favor more immigration. She said Gingrich’s avoidance of the loaded term amnesty was understandable, since his plan is limited and requires illegal immigrants to meet various requirements. She praised Gingrich for his honesty. "He’s getting pilloried for saying we can’t deport 11 million people," she said. "At least Newt is saying, ‘There’s a problem here, let’s come to grips with it.’" When Romney has been asked about what he would do with the roughly 11 million illegal immigrants who are already in the country, Romney has stopped short of urging mass deportation. "You know, there's great interest on the part of some to talk about what we do with the 11 million. My interest is saying, let's make sure that we secure the border, and we don't do anything that talks about bringing in a new wave of those or attracting a new wave of people into the country illegally," Romney said in an interview with Fox News on Nov. 29, 2011. Our ruling "Amnesty" has become a radioactive term in American politics, and Republicans in particular do not want their immigration policies described that way. Gingrich supports allowing illegal immigrants who have been in the United States for many years to apply for legal status. He’s said that process should look at each individual and whether they have "family, church and community ties." They would also have to pay a fine. What he describes sounds like a more restrictive process than the 1986 law supported by Reagan that allowed for widespread amnesty. Still, most legal amnesties include some sort of process. Gingrich’s plan is clearly an amnesty of sorts, though it is more limited in scope. The ad says Gingrich "supports amnesty for illegal immigrants." That’s a blunter claim than the statement we rated previously from Romney, that Gingrich’s plan is "a new doorway to amnesty." Romney’s comment implied that there was something new about Gingrich’s plan rather than being the same amnesty policies of the past. The ad, on the other hand, loses that nuance. So we rate its claim Half True.	None	Restore Our Future	None	None	None	2011-12-27T14:18:53	2011-12-20	['None']

A photo of a young man in glasses and a uniform, eyes looking away from the camera, has been attributed to the businessman who invests in Democratic causes. "This is George Soros," reads the text stamped above the photo in a post to Facebook on Oct. 18. "Remember this the next time the Soros-funded liberals call you a racist, fascist, or Nazi." This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The photo isn’t a fake, but it’s not George Soros. It’s an old photo of Oskar Gröning, one of 300 Auschwitz staff members. Gröning, who died in March, was a corporal in Hitler’s Waffen SS and he became known as the bookkeeper of Auschwitz, according to the New York Times’s obituary of one of the last Germans to face war-crime charges connected to the Holocaust. He was accused of being an accomplice in the murder of about 300,000 Hungarian Jews, and though he maintained that he only played an office role managing money confiscated from Jews at the death camp, he admitted to witnessing atrocities, including the gassing of Jews who had tried to escape. He was sentenced to four years in jail at age 94. Soros, meanwhile, fled fascism. When the Nazis invaded Hungary, his father obtained false identities for Soros and his brother, according to a 2018 profile of the billionaire in the New York Times. He sent Soros to live with an agricultural official who passed him off as his Christian godson. "The official’s job included taking inventory of a confiscated Jewish-owned property," according to the story. "He took George with him. These episodes have become the basis for the claim that George was a Nazi collaborator. In fact, though, there is no credible evidence that he collaborated with or was sympathetic to Nazis."

It says, of Congress’ 535 members: 36 have been accused of spousal abuse 7 have been arrested for fraud 19 have been accused of writing bad checks 117 have directly or indirectly bankrupted at least 2 businesses 3 have done time for assault 71 cannot get a credit card due to bad credit 14 have been arrested on drug-related charges 8 have been arrested for shoplifting 21 are currently defendants in lawsuits 84 have been arrested for drunk driving in the last year Wowza. One version on Facebook was posted Sept. 18 and already has more than 328,000 shares, The meme has appeared on Reddit a few times this week, too. Our friends at Snopes and FactCheck.org debunked the claims in this image years ago. But with the NFL’s current scandal concerning spousal and child abuse, it makes sense that this meme is circulating again. So we’re going to debunk it again. We don’t dispute that some lawmakers are involved in nefarious activities. Take, for example, former Rep. Trey Radel, R-Fla., who resigned earlier this year after he was caught buying cocaine from a federal agent. There’s no comprehensive database about all congressional crime and generally unsavory behavior, so we can’t come up with the real numbers on our own. But we know enough about where the meme originated to say that these statistics can’t be trusted. We searched the news, Congressional Quarterly membership profiles and other sources and couldn’t find anywhere near 84 arrests for drunk driving, 14 arrests for drug-related charges, 36 accusations of spousal abuse or any of these other accusations. We’re not even sure how you’d measure things like indirectly bankrupting a business or a person’s bad credit. The meme gives no author or source information. However, Snopes examined a near-identical 2012 version that references a 1999 series of articles by Capitol Hill Blue, an online politics publication. (Capitol Hill Blue has had several issues with credibility in the past.) Keep in mind that if these statistics were true -- and we’re reasonably certain they’re not -- they’re 15 years old. Only 100 members of the current Congress were in office in 1999, when Capitol Hill Blue published the stories. The Capitol Hill Blue articles say the authors’ research revealed each one of the statistics listed above, though sometimes with slightly different wording. (With one exception: the article says 29 members have been accused of spousal abuse, rather than 36.) The authors mention "public records, past newspaper articles, civil court cases and criminal records," but do not quote specific documents. They also say plainly of some of their sources, "We have talked with former associates and business partners who have been left out in the cold by people they thought were friends." So these sources possibly had an agenda in talking to Capitol Hill Blue. We can’t even check which members of Congress Capitol Hill Blue is talking about. The article says, "We will not run lists of every member who has written a bad check, punched somebody out or been charged with slapping a spouse." All of this makes it difficult to take these allegations seriously. Even further, the series has been removed from Capitol Hill Blue’s website. It’s only accessible through the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, which periodically saves web pages. As far as we can tell, it was removed mid 2013. (In the last version that was saved, editors had removed the statistics from the article completely.) We reached out to Capitol Hill Blue for comment but haven’t heard back. Our ruling A Facebook meme says Congress includes 36 people accused of spousal abuse, 84 arrested for drunk driving in the past year, 71 with terrible credit and more. These accusations appear to be fabricated. The statistics come from an article written 15 years ago, and the original source, Capitol Hill Blue, has removed the original article from its website. Congress’ record isn’t blemish-free, by any means, but these statistics have no basis in fact. We rate this meme Pants on Fire!

pomt-14022	"We're losing thousands of (veterans) waiting on line" because they can't get speedy health care from the Veterans Administration.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/01/donald-trump/donald-trump-thousands-veterans-die-waiting-treatm/	During a news conference called by Donald Trump to explain where money went from a veterans fundraiser, the presumptive Republican nominee for president was asked about the Veterans Administration health system. "I'm entirely in favor of fixing the VA health care. The VA is one of the great catastrophes in this country," he said. "People are waiting five days, six days, seven days on line. They're dying while they wait on line. And I am in favor of, if they can't get to a doctor within a reasonable period of time, they're gonna go see a doctor and the country's going to pay for it. They're going to a private doctor, or a public hospital, or a public doctor but someplace that can take care (of them) immediately. We're losing thousands of people waiting on line." We looked at this issue in October when Trump contended that, "Over 300,000 veterans have died waiting for care." At the time, he didn't explain where he got the estimate, but it dovetailed with a Sept. 2, 2015, report from the VA Office of Inspector General that tried to investigate a claim that 47,000 veterans died because the VA didn't process their health care applications in a timely manner. We rated Trump's claim Mostly False for several reasons, one of which was, as the report clearly stated, that 300,000 number — actually 307,173 — was an upper limit, reflecting the maximum number of unprocessed enrollment applications where, according to Social Security records, the applicant had died. But because the VA recordkeeping was so horrible, the report concluded, "we cannot determine specifically how many pending (enrollment system) records represent veterans who applied for health care benefits or when they may have applied." As PolitiFact reported last year, investigators said that some of those people were not veterans; not all of them were seeking health care or necessarily any VA service; and some of them died before 1998, when the database began. For example, the count is complicated by the fact that VA services include home loans and disability payments, some health care to family members of veterans and non-veteran employees of the VA system, and people receiving humanitarian care. In addition, in 2013, the VA added millions of records from other arms of the agency into the mix. Many of those ended up in the pending file because the software didn't allow a determination of whether the people were actually applying for medical care. Thus, an accurate count was impossible. However, Trump's new assertion backs off the 300,000 claim dramatically. At the news conference, he simply said that "thousands" had died waiting for health care from the VA, a disturbing but still far more modest claim. Having close to 2,000 instances would qualify as "thousands," so if just 1 percent of the 307,173 records logged by the inspector general were cases of veterans dying before their paperwork could be processed, his claim would clear the bar. Clearly, deadly delays do happen. Investigators looking into operations at the urology unit of the Phoenix VA reported in 2015 that 1,484 cancer patients experienced significant delays in their care, 10 "were placed at 'unnecessary risk for adverse outcomes.' At least half of those died," according to the Washington Post. CNN concluded in 2014 that it had identified 19 people who had died because of delays in getting simple medical screens at VA hospitals around the country. At one, the Dorn Veterans Medical Center in Columbia, S.C., at least six people had died. "At the Charlie Norwood VA Medical Center in Augusta, Ga., the VA said three veterans died as a result of delayed care," CNN reported. In addition, the VA system is huge, with 1,550 sites providing some type of health care. It wouldn't take many cases at each site to have thousands dying because they couldn't get a timely appointment. We asked the Trump campaign for the source of the statistic, but didn't hear back. Our ruling Trump said, "We're losing thousands of (veterans) waiting on line" because they can't get speedy health care from the Veterans Administration. Similar claims that 300,000 died because of delays by the VA clearly don't have hard evidence to back them up. Instances at individual VA hospitals seldom go into double digits, so there's no hard evidence there that the number of deaths is in the thousands either. Trump dialed back the rhetoric, but the claim still leaves out important context.

pomt-15290	The United States is "fighting with Iraqis to defeat ISIS along with Iran. But in Yemen we're fighting Iran with Iraqis and Saudis."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2015/jul/23/jon-stewart/fact-checking-jon-stewarts-last-daily-show-intervi/	President Barack Obama thanked retiring Daily Show host Jon Stewart for being a "great gift to the country" in the commander in chief’s seventh and final appearance on the show with Stewart as its leader. "I can’t believe that you’re leaving before me," Obama said, adding that he would be issuing a new executive order that Stewart cannot leave. When the laughs died down, Stewart tried to press Obama for serious answers about the Iran nuclear deal and Middle East relations. "Let me ask you a question about Iran. Whose team are we on in the Middle East?" Stewart said. "So we're fighting with Iraqis to defeat ISIS along with Iran. But in Yemen we're fighting Iran with Iraqis and Saudis." "That’s not quite right," Obama laughed, "but that’s okay." Obama went on to call Iran an anti-American, anti-Israel, anti-Semitic adversary that sponsors terrorist organizations, but he never said what wasn’t quite right about the relationships that Stewart described. We wanted to fact-check Stewart on the United States’ complicated ties in the Middle East. Was Stewart right in saying that Iran was a U.S. ally against ISIS and an enemy in Yemen? U.S. and Iran against ISIS While both the United States and Iran are fighting against ISIS, they are not cooperating or fighting as allies. Iran is not included as part of the 60-member coalition the United States has assembled to fight ISIS. Stewart overstated the Iran-U.S. relationship, said Richard Brennan, a senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation. Even though the United States and Iran are on the same side in fighting ISIS, the nations are not allies. Iran wants more influence in the area than the United States wants it to have. "Iran has the longstanding goal of establishing itself as a prominent power in the region," Brennan said. Iran wants a "weak and stable" Iraq that will acquiesce to Iran’s goals. Iran’s support of certain Shia militias in Iraq is also a reason that the United States has "expressed concerns about Iran’s role in Iraq," said Alistair Baskey, White House National Security Council spokesman. Shia militias often target Iraqi Sunnis (and vice-versa) in a conflict that dates back centuries. So even though the Shia militias are part of a broader front against ISIS, Brennan said they are still the same people responsible for killing Americans in previous conflicts. One example is Abu Mohandis (also known as Jamal Jafaar Mohammed), the current leader of the Popular Mobilization Forces (the sum total of all Shia militias in Iraq) who was responsible for the 1983 bombings of the U.S. and French embassies in Kuwait. He acted in the capacity of an "Iranian agent in Iraq" according to a 2007 CNN article. Another reason why the United States refuses to openly support or work as an official ally of Iran: It is a staunch supporter of Syria’s Bashar al-Assad. The United States opposes Assad’s regime and has called for Assad to "step aside" multiple times as the government brutally cracked down on its people, including the regime’s chemical weapon attacks on Syrian citizens dating back to 2012. The battle in Yemen Now for the other arrangement Stewart described: Is the U.S. fighting against Iran in Yemen? Not directly. The United States continues to "provide logistical and intelligence support" to a Saudi Arabia-led coalition of the Gulf Cooperation Council fighting the Houthi militia in Yemen, Baskey said. The coalition includes Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, and Qatar. (Oman is not a member of the coalition, although it is a member of the GCC.) The Houthi militia forces have rallied against Yemen’s president, Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi, who took office in 2012 but was forced to resign by Houthi rebels in January 2015. (On Feb. 6, 2015, Houthi rebels announced Mohammed Ali al-Houthi as the president of their Revolutionary Committee). Analysts said Iran is suspected of arming, training and equipping Houthi militia. According to a Defense News article, the United States was "monitoring" Iranian ships that may have been delivering weapons to Houthi military. The Iranian government has officially denied helping Houthi forces, according to a BBC article. However, neither Iran nor the United States is doing the actual fighting in Yemen. " ‘We’ are not fighting in Yemen – though U.S. Special Forces may be involved," said Theodore R. Bromund, a senior research fellow at the Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy at the Heritage Foundation. "It is the Saudis who are doing the fighting." Several experts also pointed out that Stewart was wrong about Iraq’s participation in Yemen. "We are not aware of any Iraqi involvement in the Yemen conflict," Baskey confirmed. Our ruling Stewart said the United States is "fighting with Iraqis to defeat ISIS along with Iran. But in Yemen we're fighting Iran with Iraqis and Saudis." As Obama pointed out, Stewart's claim is off on a few points — Iran is not an official ally of the United States against ISIS even though both countries are fighting the terrorist group; the United States is not directly fighting Iran in Yemen; and Iraqi soldiers are not involved in the Yemen conflict. But Stewart's overall perspective that the United States and Iran are in the unusual position of fighting against the same enemy in one country and working against each other in another is not too far off the mark. His statement is partially accurate but lacking in some details. So we rate his claim Half True.

pomt-04941	Says Minnesota has more Fortune 500 companies than Oregon and "one of the most obvious differences is they've invested in their schools."	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2012/jul/27/jefferson-smith/has-oregon-lost-out-fortune-500-business-because-l/	Portland Public Schools is eyeing a bond vote during the November election to help rebuild and refurbish aging school buildings. During a recent school board hearing on the issue, Portland mayoral candidates Jefferson Smith and Charlie Hales sat together and spoke out in favor of the idea. Learning is the priority, they said, but the environment plays a big role in just how well students learn. During his testimony, Smith sought to silence critics who might question the timing of the bond, given how depressed the economy remains. The fact is, he said, that education is inextricably tied to a healthy economy in the state. The connection between the economy and education becomes clear, he said, "when we understand and compare what's happened in Minnesota, when in 1980 they had 10 Fortune 500 companies and so did Oregon, and now they have 19 and we have two. "And the biggest difference has not been tax rates -- they've been paying more taxes -- one of the most obvious differences is they've invested in their schools." Several studies have shown Smith’s larger point to be true: Education and economics are linked. But, we wondered, was his example comparing Oregon to Minnesota apt? We checked it out. We started with the number of Fortune 500 companies. Those are easy to get; Fortune Magazine keeps an online list of them. Smith was right as far as the current numbers go. Oregon is home to two of the 500 companies -- Nike and Precision Castparts -- while Minnesota is home to 19. As for how things looked 30 years ago, Smith is off. Thirty years ago, Oregon was home to six Fortune 500 companies while Minnesota had 11. Next up, we looked at state tax burdens. The Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan tax research organization has numbers as recent as 2009 on its website. According to the foundation, Oregon’s tax burden is 9.8 percent of income which puts it at No. 17 nationally -- with No. 1 having the highest burden. Minnesota meanwhile has a burden of 10.3 percent, putting it at No. 7. (When we contacted the Smith campaign, manager Henry Kraemer also pointed to the Foundation’s Business Tax Climate Index, which was updated this year. According to that index Minnesota is one of the worst places to do business and comes in at No. 45, while Oregon ranked far higher at No. 13.) The last bit was education funding. For that, we turned to the U.S. Census Bureau. According to figures from the 2009-10 school year -- the most recent available -- Oregon spent about $9,600 per student, while Minnesota spent $10,700. Now, that $1,000 or so might not seem like a lot, especially given that New York State spends nearly $19,000 per student, but it’s enough to put Minnesota just over the national average while Oregon comes in just below. Except for the discrepancy on the number of 500 companies in both states 30 years ago, Smith seemed to be right, as far as the facts go. A question lingered, however: Was Smith right to link the education being provided in Minnesota to its more robust business climate? John Gallup, an assistant professor of economics at Portland State University, said that the link "does have a good basis in terms of research … companies can't get their employees to move unless there are good school districts." He forwarded us an email from his colleague, James Wood, another assistant professor of economics, who cited one study from Paul D. Gottlieb called "Residential Amenities, Firm Location and Economic Development" done back in 1995 that shows "positive influence of teachers and expenditures per pupil on firm location." We also tried Tim Duy, a University of Oregon economist. He agreed that education is a potential draw for companies as they seek to hire employees of a high caliber. That said, he wasn’t so sold on the idea that Fortune 500 companies might pick Minnesota over Oregon for the schools, however good they may be. "I'd be willing to bet that most of that location is an accident of history," Duy said. When we spoke to Smith, he said he didn’t disagree with that but added "the importance of education is not merely to attract businesses ... but also to grow them and to help them adapt to a changing environment. "If we meaningfully invested in education now, it would pay dividends." There are a number of points to consider when ruling on this one. Smith was right on a couple things: Oregon has two Fortune 500 companies, while Minnesota has 19. Meanwhile, Oregon’s tax climate is friendlier to businesses and Minnesota spends more per student. He was off on the figures from 1980, however. As for the connection between education and the number of 500 companies in a given state, that’s a little dicier. Certainly, there’s evidence that businesses consider education when locating, but would an extra $1,000 a year for the next couple decades mean we’d catch up with Minnesota? Probably not. Oregon used to be above the national average in per-student funding and we still didn’t rank high in the number of Fortune 500 companies. There are dozens of factors for a business to consider. That said, Smith’s central point here is accurate -- better education is important to business -- and most of his numbers stand up. But we think it’s important to understand that improving education, while important, won’t necessarily lead to dozens of Fortune 500 companies locating in Oregon. We’ll call this one Mostly True.

pomt-00327	"Close to half of the children" in California are "at or near poverty," when you consider cost-of-living.	true	/california/statements/2018/sep/19/gavin-newsom/true-nearly-half-californias-children-are-or-near-/	Democratic candidate for governor Gavin Newsom recently described California as both "the richest and poorest state." The economy is booming for many, he said, while millions of others are mired in poverty. That includes nearly half of the state’s children, when considering the state’s high "cost-of-living," he claimed. "Close to half of the children (are) at or near poverty," Newsom said while campaigning in Los Angeles County on Sept. 10, 2018. "How can that be in this place, this extraordinary place, in the world’s 5th largest economy? We must do more and we must do better." Did Newsom get his facts right on this sad statistic? We set out on a fact check. Our research Newsom’s campaign spokesman said the claim is supported by the July 2018 report "Child Poverty in California." That study produced an updated look at what researchers call the California Poverty Measure, which is a joint research effort by the Public Policy Institute of California and the Stanford Center on Poverty and Inequality to closely examine poverty in the state. It found that 45.8 percent of children in California were "at or near poverty" in 2016, the most recent year examined. That matches with Newsom’s statement of "close to half." But we wanted to know how researchers came up with that number. Caroline Danielson, a PPIC policy director and co-author of the study, said the California Poverty Measure takes into account California’s high cost-of-living, as well as factors that offset those costs, such as the state’s social safety net programs. The report found the share of children in poverty was 21 percent. It found an additional nearly 25 percent lived "near poverty," meaning their family incomes was one-and-a-half times the poverty line, Danielson said. In the report, the income threshold for poverty varies by region. In a high-cost county, including many places along the coast, the average threshold for a family of four is $30,000 per year, Danielson explained. A family that makes less than that would be considered in poverty. In that same county, near poverty includes families whose incomes range from $30,000 to $45,000, or one-and-a-half times the poverty line. Other counties had lower income thresholds. To reach 45.8 percent figure, the study combined children who live at or near poverty in all regions of the state. Danielson said the state’s child poverty rate has declined from 25 percent in 2011, the first year PPIC produced the California Poverty Measure, to 21 percent in 2016. Census figures also support claim The finding that nearly half of California’s children live at or near poverty is also supported by data in the U.S. Census Bureau’s Supplemental Poverty Measure. An updated version of that report, which also takes into account cost-of-living, was released this month. For 2016, it found 22.5 percent of California’s children live in poverty while a total of 45 percent live at or near poverty, according to a review of that report’s 2016 public-use dataset conducted by Danielson at our request. The Census Bureau’s Supplemental Poverty Measure has gained wide acceptance among researchers over the agency’s Official Poverty Measure, which does not take state-by-state variations in cost into account. Two researchers, however, raised questions in a recent op-ed in the San Francisco Chronicle about relying too much on that measure. David Brady, professor of public policy and director of the Blum Initiative on Global and Regional Poverty at UC Riverside and Zachary Parolin, a researcher at the University of Antwerp’s Herman Deleeck Centre for Social Policy, asked "whether California’s poverty rate should depend so exclusively and overwhelmingly on housing costs." They proposed using questions about median income, alongside the supplemental poverty measure, to arrive at poverty rates. This isn’t the first claim we’ve fact-checked on California’s dismal poverty rate. In January 2017, we rated True a claim by Republican Assemblyman Chad Mayes that California had the nation’s highest overall poverty rate, when including children and adults and factoring in cost-of-living. Mayes, at the time, was citing the state’s 20.6 percent overall poverty rate for the period 2013 to 2015. That rate has dropped slightly but remains the highest in the nation at 19 percent, according to the Supplemental Poverty Measure for 2017. Newsom’s plan for child poverty Newsom has described California’s child poverty as "a moral outrage." His campaign website includes several proposals for reducing it. They include, among other plans, creating college savings accounts for every incoming kindergartener; expanding the state’s Earned Income Tax Credit for very low-income earners; and increasing CalWORKS grants, a financial assistance program for families in need. Our ruling Democratic candidate for governor Gavin Newsom recently claimed "close to half of the children" in California are "at or near poverty," when you consider the state’s cost-of-living. A July 2018 report by the Public Policy Institute of California backs up Newsom’s statement. It accounts for cost-of-living in each region of the state and found 45.8 percent of the state’s children live at or near poverty. Another report, the U.S. Census Bureau’s Supplemental Poverty Measure, also confirms the claim. Newsom’s statement is supported by credible reports and includes necessary context.

pomt-04451	Says Chris Christie created "this new category where you could get laid off and just be totally denied unemployment benefits forever."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/oct/11/barbara-buono/chris-christie-created-new-category-denies-unemplo/	For a certain group of New Jerseyans, losing their jobs can mean being denied unemployment benefits indefinitely, according to state Sen. Barbara Buono. The Middlesex County Democrat recently claimed that Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, created that new category of unemployed persons when he reformed the state’s unemployment insurance law in 2010. "A few years ago, the governor -- in so-called reform of the unemployment law -- created...this new category where you could get laid off and just be totally denied unemployment benefits forever," Buono said in an Oct. 1 interview on NJToday. Buono’s statement is essentially correct. Based on Christie’s recommendations, state officials in 2010 created a category where individuals fired for "severe misconduct" could be barred from receiving unemployment benefits for as long as they remain unemployed. But the Democrat-led state Legislature bears responsibility for signing off on Christie’s proposed changes. Also, if someone gets another job after being fired for severe misconduct, it’s possible for the wages from that first job to ultimately count toward unemployment benefits. Buono used the phrase "laid off," but state regulations typically refer to such individuals as being "discharged" or "fired." First, let’s explain what severe misconduct means. The state originally had two categories of misconduct cases: misconduct and gross misconduct. Gross misconduct related to behavior that was criminal in nature. Misconduct applied to everything else. State officials created a third category of severe misconduct to recognize behavior that was worse than simple misconduct, but still fell short of being gross misconduct. Examples of severe misconduct include the use of drugs or alcohol on the job and the destruction or theft of company property. Christie recommended adding that category when he conditionally vetoed a bill passed by the Legislature to change the unemployment insurance tax rates paid by employers. Buono voted against accepting the governor’s proposed changes, but most other legislators voted in favor of them and Christie signed the bill into law in July 2010. "It was a bi-partisan effort to make it a fairer system," Harold Wirths, commissioner of the state Department of Labor and Workforce Development, said in a statement. Christina Zuk, Buono’s chief of staff, maintained that Christie created the category, pointing out that it didn’t exist until he added it to the bill through his conditional veto. From July 2010 to August 2012, 15,961 unemployment benefit claims were denied for severe misconduct, according to labor department data. However, there’s still a chance a person fired for severe misconduct could ultimately receive unemployment benefits based in part on wages from that job. Here’s how it works: Employment benefits are based on wages earned during a 52-week period called a "base year." Let’s say that after being fired for severe misconduct, that person gets another job, meets certain employment criteria and then loses that job for reasons not related to misconduct. If both jobs occurred within the same base year, then the person could cite both sets of wages to calculate his unemployment benefits, according to department spokesman Brian Murray. But Zuk argued the new category still means individuals won’t receive benefits after they first become unemployed due to "severe misconduct." "Therefore an individual who finds him or herself unemployed due to ‘severe misconduct’ will have no means of sustaining themselves until they find another job," Zuk said in an e-mail. "The DOL spokesperson's statement only becomes relevant if the unemployed individual finds a new job and re-qualifies for benefits." Our ruling In a TV interview, Buono claimed Christie created "this new category where you could get laid off and just be totally denied unemployment benefits forever." The senator’s claim isn’t far off. Based on Christie’s recommendations, state officials created a "severe misconduct" category in which individuals could be denied unemployment benefits for as long as they remain unemployed. But the Legislature agreed to create that category as well. Also, there is a scenario in which a person fired for severe misconduct could later receive unemployment benefits based in part on wages from that job. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-08801	"Some Republican leaders in Congress" are "pushing to make privatizing Social Security a key part of their legislative agenda if they win a majority in Congress this fall."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/18/barack-obama/barack-obama-claims-republican-leaders-plan-privat/	On the 75th anniversary of Franklin Roosevelt signing Social Security into law, President Barack Obama dusted off an old campaign attack during his weekly address, claiming that Republicans once again intend to privatize the program. We couldn't recall any members of the Republican leadership recently calling for such a drastic change, and so we decided to check out whether this was a legitimate issue or a trumped up scare tactic heading into the fall election season. Obama raised the issue in an address titled, "Honoring Social Security, Not Privatizing It." "One thing we can’t afford to do though is privatize Social Security – an ill-conceived idea that would add trillions of dollars to our budget deficit while tying your benefits to the whims of Wall Street traders and the ups and downs of the stock market," Obama said. Obama noted that this was a debate dating to 2005 when then President George W. Bush floated a plan to allow workers under 55 to invest a portion of their Social Security taxes into personal retirement accounts. Even though Republicans controlled Congress at the time, the idea never gathered much steam (perhaps, in part, because Democrats then labeled the plan as "privatization"), and it died without even being introduced as proposed legislation. "I’d have thought that debate would’ve been put to rest once and for all by the financial crisis we’ve just experienced," Obama said. "I’d have thought, after being reminded how quickly the stock market can tumble, after seeing the wealth people worked a lifetime to earn wiped out in a matter of days, that no one would want to place bets with Social Security on Wall Street; that everyone would understand why we need to be prudent about investing the retirement money of tens of millions of Americans. "But some Republican leaders in Congress don’t seem to have learned any lessons from the past few years. They’re pushing to make privatizing Social Security a key part of their legislative agenda if they win a majority in Congress this fall." If this all sounds familiar, you may recall that during the presidential campaign, Obama accused Sen. John McCain of wanting to revitalize Bush's plan to "privatize" Social Security. We ruled that claim Barely True. So why reintroduce the attack now? White House officials pointed us toward the "Roadmap for America’s Future," a bill from Rep. Paul Ryan, the ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee. The plan includes a proposal to allow people under 55 to steer a portion of their payroll taxes toward an individual retirement account of their choosing, but overseen by the Social Security Administration. We decided to look at Obama's claim from two angles. First, is it fair to describe Ryan's plan as "privatizing" Social Security? And second, is Ryan's plan a key part of the legislative agenda being pursued by Republican leadership in Congress? Is Ryan's plan to "privatize" Social Security? Ryan's plan -- which is similar but not identical to Bush's -- would allow workers under 55 to begin investing a portion of their Social Security taxes in a series of funds managed by the government (Ryan calls them "personal retirement accounts"). But that's a far cry from privatizing the entirety of Social Security. To start, for those currently 55 and older, the current Social Security System would not be affected one way or another; they would simply receive their benefits as they are set up today and could not opt into a personal account. And for those under 55, the possibility of creating a personal retirement account would be totally optional -- one could choose to stay in the traditional government-run system and receive benefits as they have been promised. And lastly, for those who do choose to create a personal retirement account, the plan would only allow -- over time -- for people to invest a little over a third of their payroll taxes in the personal account. In an e-mail response to PolitiFact, Ryan argued that it would be incorrect to call even the personal retirement account portion "privatized." "In the personal-accounts system, the accounts are owned by the individual, and managed and overseen by Social Security — not a stockbroker or private investment firm," Ryan stated. "People choosing the reformed system select from a handful of government-regulated options — just as Members of Congress and federal employees do." Not everyone agrees. An analysis of Ryan's "Roadmap" plan from the left-leaning Center of Budget and Policy Priorities, argues that, "what makes these accounts private is their ownership, not their oversight or management." We think one could make a plausible argument that the Ryan plan would establish a partially privatized plan. But Obama's sweeping characterization that Republicans are attempting to privatize Social Security seems to be one (big) part scare tactic. When Obama talks about "tying your benefits to the whims of Wall Street traders and the ups and downs of the stock market," it seems to suggest that the plan would affect the benefits being paid to people currently getting Social Security, but those people would be specifically excluded from creating personal retirement accounts because they would only be available to those under 55. Which brings us to the second part of our analysis: Is Ryan's plan a key part of the legislative agenda being pursued by Republican leadership in Congress? It certainly doesn't appear so. Ryan's bill has 13 co-sponsors (all Republicans); and the White House correctly notes that among them are Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., the Republican Study Committee Chairman, and Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Ca., Assistant Republican Whip. Specifically and conspicuously, however, among those who have not signed on as co-sponsors are the big three in Republican leadership: House Republican Leader John Boehner, Republican Whip Eric Cantor and the Republican Conference Chairman Mike Pence. According to Michael Steel, a spokesman for Boehner, "As Rep. Ryan and Republican leaders have made clear repeatedly, the Roadmap is Rep. Ryan's vision of long-term conservative reform. It is not an official position of House Republicans in any way, shape or form. Boehner has thanked Rep. Ryan for offering this vision - but he has not co-sponsored or endorsed it, nor has any other member of the House Republican Leadership." Nor does the plan appear to have much traction among Senate Republican leaders. Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, noted that McConnell has said he hopes the Obama-created deficit commission will come forward with a Social Security plan he and other Republicans can support. "I don’t know of a single plan (including Rep. Ryan's) that would take the Social Security that seniors currently have and subject it to 'the whims' of Wall Street," Stewart added. "The White House doesn’t know of any either. ... The president falsely claimed that Republican leaders in Congress are trying to take current benefits from seniors and put them in the stock market." Stewart suggested Obama's comments may be prompted by the results of a recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll that showed the the Democrats' lead on the question of which party would do a better job on ‘dealing with Social Security’ is now down to only 4 points (30 percent to 26 percent); compared to a 28 point advantage for Democrats on that question in October 2006. As we noted earlier, Obama has gone to this well before. Accusing Republicans of trying to privatize Social Security no doubt scores political points with many, particularly seniors who depend on it. But as it was during the campaign, Obama's warning is a big stretch. The only "Republican leader" who is really talking about allowing personal retirement accounts is Ryan, and even his plan is a far cry from a wholly privatized system. We rate Obama's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-00683	"Amendments (Hillary Clinton) supported and voted for in 2006, she no longer supported in 2008," showing she changed positions on an India nuclear deal.	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/may/06/peter-schweizer/clinton-cash-author-hillary-changed-positions-indi/	As a senator, Hillary Clinton flip-flopped on a nuclear deal with India -- swayed by donations to her family’s foundation. At least that’s what Clinton Cash author Peter Schweizer asserts. Schweizer’s book -- which hit shelves May 5 -- purports to document a series of donations to the Clinton Foundation and other financial gifts that turned into special favors from Clinton while she was a senator and secretary of state. One such allegation, which Schweizer discussed in a May 1 interview with MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell, is that Clinton did not support a nuclear deal with India in 2006, but two years and millions of India-based donations to her foundation later, she changed her mind. But is this an accurate account? Mitchell said MSNBC’s research found that Clinton supported the nuclear deal with India all along. Schweizer responded that in 2006, Clinton supported nuclear cooperation -- with restrictions, which didn’t suit the Indian government’s position. But in 2008, she no longer supported those restrictions. This is evidenced by her votes on amendments that would have put limitations on the deal, he said. "Amendments she supported and voted for in 2006, she no longer supported in 2008," he said. Who’s right here? Did Clinton change position or not? We decided to look for ourselves and see if we could sort it out. Apples and oranges First, a very brief chronology. Congress first took up the issue of a civilian nuclear trade deal with India in 2006. That year, they passed legislation to change existing atomic energy law, necessary for the negotiations to move forward. Then in 2008, following diplomatic negotiations, Congress approved the final deal, which allowed the United States to export to India nuclear fuel and technology. Clinton, a founding member of the Senate India Caucus, supported both measures. In 2006, Clinton released a public statement praising the legislation and voted for the final bill. In 2008, she voted for the deal, and the Indian press said Clinton had expressed her support in meetings with Indian leaders. What about the amendments? In 2006, Clinton did vote in the Senate in favor of three failed amendments that would have placed some limitations on the deal: One required India to end military cooperation with Iran, another called for assurances that the deal would not help India develop nuclear weapons, and the third declared support of a United Nations resolution regarding nuclear disarmament. Some supporters of the deal said these amendments could kill the deal. Schweizer said Clinton no longer supported these amendments when Congress revisited the nuclear deal two years later. However, the 2008 bill only had one Senate amendment, and it was defeated by voice vote, meaning the votes were not recorded. Without a recorded vote, or any public comment from Clinton, it’s impossible to know whether she supported the 2008 amendment or not. Further, the single 2008 amendment was fundamentally different than the amendments voted on in 2006. It laid out implications for the deal in the event that India detonated a nuclear weapon, while none of the 2006 amendments addressed this question. So not only is comparing Clinton’s position on the 2006 and 2008 amendments impossible, given the fact that there is no documentation of Clinton’s support or opposition in 2008 -- but the amendments are apples and oranges that don’t offer a meaningful comparison. We want to note that Schweizer pointed us to two statements of Indian business leaders to show that Clinton did not support the deal in 2006, though they aren’t without holes. On June 29, 2006, the leader of the conservative Indian-American Republican Council, said Clinton had "made little effort to support the agreement despite being India Caucus co-chair." However, Clinton put out a press release on the same day that said she intended to vote for the legislation, noting that the Senate version was an improvement upon the White House version. Hotelier Sant Chatwal -- a major fundraiser for the Clintons who was recently found guilty of skirting campaign finance laws -- advocated for the nuclear deal, and he said (in 2010) that Clinton didn’t favor the deal as of May 2006. But again, she expressed public support about a month later. Maybe Chatwal helped change her mind between May and June 2006, or maybe not. Either way this does not show a change in position from 2006 to 2008. Our ruling Schweizer said, "Amendments (Hillary Clinton) supported and voted for in 2006, she no longer supported in 2008," showing she changed positions on an India nuclear deal. We know Clinton voted for several amendments on Indian nuclear deal-related legislation in 2006. The 2008 legislation, however, had just one amendment, and the vote was not recorded. Because we don’t know how she voted, and she did not make any public statements about it, it’s impossible to know her position on the 2008 amendment. Additionally, the 2008 amendment was fundamentally different than any of the amendments the Senate considered in 2006. Even if we knew whether she supported the 2008 amendment, it wouldn’t necessarily show a change in position. What’s more, Clinton showed public support for a deal in 2006, and she voted in favor of the deal in both 2006 and 2008. We rate Schweizer’s claim False.

pomt-02311	"Ralph Hall has never voted to raise the debt ceiling."	false	/texas/statements/2014/mar/31/cat-pac/us-rep-ralph-hall-texas-voted-increase-debt-limit-/	You have to go a long way back to trace U.S. Rep. Ralph Hall’s voting record. A conservative political action committee claimed the Northeast Texas Republican "has never voted to raise the debt ceiling" in a mail flier forwarded March 10, 2014, to PolitiFact Texas by Matt Mackowiak, an adviser to his challenger in the May 27, 2014, primary runoff for the GOP nomination. Hall, who faces former U.S. Attorney John Ratcliffe, was elected to Congress in 1980 and has served 17 terms; he’s the oldest serving House member in history, as PolitiFact wrote March 20, 2014, in a fact-check rating False a charge that Hall was "the oldest member in Congress ever." Since 1980, there have been more than 50 votes to raise the debt ceiling, which caps how much the U.S. government can borrow to carry out everything budgeted by Congress. And during Hall’s tenure, the limit has never been reduced. But did Hall, who promises in a campaign ad that he "won’t raise the debt ceiling, ever," never vote before to increase the cap? Debt ceiling votes tend to split on party lines. Typically, the party that controls the White House has had to push through the politically ticklish vote to raise the limit, while the other party gets a free run at criticizing the hike and voting against it. Memorably, Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., voted against raising the ceiling in 2006 when the Republican president, George W. Bush, sought an increase. Hall has been on both sides of that partisan divide, serving as a Democrat (albeit a conservative one) until Jan. 5, 2004, when he switched to the GOP. Click here to visit the Washington Post’s interactive graphic on increases in the debt ceiling, updated Feb. 11, 2013 and spanning most of U.S. Rep. Ralph Hall’s time in Congress. We called and emailed the Conservatives Acting Together PAC for information on its claim and didn’t hear back. Hall campaign spokesman Ed Valentine told us by phone that the campaign wasn’t involved with the mailer. Mackowiak told us by email that contrary to the PAC’s claim, Hall voted seven times to raise the ceiling from December 1985 through April 2005 -- twice under President Ronald Reagan, twice under President BIll Clinton and three times under Bush. Mackowiak’s breakdown almost entirely holds up, though we found that some of Hall’s votes for raising the ceiling were wrapped into other House decisions. According to the House clerk’s office and the Congressional Record, Hall voted five times in favor of raising the ceiling, though most of these instances were not pure votes on elevating the ceiling. Such increases were, for example, wrapped into the Contract with America Advancement Act of 1996 and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. In the other two cases Mackowiak cited, one each in 1985 and 2005, the ceiling-hike resolutions were passed by the House as a whole, rather than by individual representatives voting. This came about under the Gephardt rule, named after former Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., which operated on the premise that if representatives had voted for the budget, they had intended to fund everything in the budget, and it was thus not necessary to force them to take the potentially unpopular step of voting to raise the debt limit separately. In 2005, Hall voted for the House budget measure that triggered the debt limit hike. But in 1985, he voted against the original House version of the budget that was wrapped into the resolution the Senate approved -- so under the logic of the Gephardt rule, Hall presumably did not approve the debt limit increase that came with that budget. Hall votes: April 28, 2005, House Joint Resolution 47 deemed passed. Hall voted for the budget measure that triggered it. Nov. 18, 2004, vote for Senate Bill 2986. June 27, 2002, vote for Senate Bill 2578. July 30, 1997, vote for House Resolution 2015. March 28, 1996, vote for House Resolution 3136. Aug. 14, 1986, vote for House Resolution 5395. Dec. 11, 1985, House Joint Resolution 372 deemed passed. Hall voted against House Concurrent Resolution 152, which was wrapped into Senate Concurrent Resolution 32, the approval of which triggered HJR 372. Our ruling The PAC said, "Ralph Hall has never voted to raise the debt ceiling." We didn’t have to look further than the votes cited by his opponent’s campaign to find six instances from 1986 through 2005 in which Hall backed debt-limit increases. We rate this claim as False.

pomt-09908	"In North Carolina, they used stimulus money to hire one new state worker. His job, apply for more stimulus funds from the taxpayers by the way of the federal government."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/07/john-boehner/boehner-claims-city-uses-stimulus-money-hire-someo/	And now, the story of little Washington meets big Washington. In a tongue-in-cheek Web ad from House Republican leader John Boehner, the GOP "releases the dogs on the money trail" to find jobs created by the Obama-backed economic stimulus package. Ellie Mae, the GOP's job-sniffing bloodhound, found two things of interest. We dealt with one, the impact of a federally funded bridge on Rusty's Backwater Saloon in Stevens Point, Wis., with this Truth-O-Meter ruling . Here we'll address Ellie Mae's discovery that "in North Carolina, they used stimulus money to hire one new state worker. His job: apply for more stimulus funds from the taxpayers by the way of the federal government." Which brings us to little Washington ... Washington, N.C., population around 10,000. This small city in the inland coastal region of North Carolina first came under the national microscope with the release of a report from Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., called "100 Stimulus Projects: A Second Opinion." At No. 65 on Coburn's list of questionable stimulus projects: "Washington, North Carolina, is using stimulus funds to pay for 'project-funding manager' whose job it is to secure even more stimulus funds. The city hopes to pay the new 'project funding manager' to identify available stimulus money using a $40,234 grant from the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program which, in turn, received funding through the stimulus bill." We called Washington, N.C., city officials to get to the bottom of this. First off, the city of Washington did hire someone in late February whose job it is to seek out stimulus money for which the city might be eligible. The part-time job was titled "stimulus coordinator" and was performed by Bianca Gentile. But Gentile wasn't paid through stimulus money. Her wages have been "100 percent paid with local fire, police, water utility, sewer utility and electric utility funds," according to the City Manager James C. Smith in a letter to the Office of Economic Recovery and Investment in North Carolina. The city's top priority these days is building a new police station. The current building is more than 40 years old. It's "way too small for the size of our force," said Mayor Judy Jennette. And it's also prone to flooding during hurricanes, which is especially troublesome because the city's 911 dispatchers are housed there too. The estimated cost — $12 million. With 24 percent of Washington's citizens categorized as low income, Jennette said, the price tag is just too steep for local taxpayers to bear alone. One of the stimulus opportunities identified by Gentile, the city-paid stimulus coordinator, was a planner who could help the city gets its police station. The city applied for — and got — an Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance grant for $40,234 to fund the one-year cost of a Law Enforcement Economic Assistance Coordinator. The stimulus did provide $2 billion to the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program, so the Boehner ad (and Coburn's report) is correct in saying the position was funded through the stimulus. But the idea that the job can be summarized as simply to "apply for more stimulus funds," is incorrect, Washington, N.C., officials said. Here's how the job description reads: "Under limited supervision, (the coordinator) facilitates and conducts research and statistical analysis related to police and municipal programming. This includes the preparation of various reports, departmental strategic plans and programmatic/project evaluations and reports. The LEDP initiates, conducts, and implements research studies and surveys in support of multiple grant programs to provide a basis for management control, decision making and an improved quality life. Performs related duties as assigned." There are then nine bulleted items under "duties, functions and responsibilities." We won't bore you with all of them, but among them are compiling data for reports on police performance and community development initiatives and attending conferences, conventions and other educational and professional meetings to keep updated on planning methods and administration. And yes, part of one bullet notes that the coordinator will "provide narrative material for grant proposals." In other words, he or she will pursue federal grant money to help offset the cost of the police station. But Gentile and other city officials say they're not aware of any stimulus money the city could get for that purpose. Rather, according to Gentile and the mayor, the coordinator will likely target grant funding and/or low-interest loans from USDA, FEMA, Homeland Security and federal and state sources. The job has nothing to do with getting stimulus money, said Gentile, who plans to apply for the job. "To the best of my knowledge, there is no stimulus money available that we could use for a police station," Gentile said. Any responsible local government would try to find as much outside grant money as it can, said Mayor Jennette: "We are simply trying to build a new police station as cost effectively as we can for our citizens." We'll concede that the ad is catchy. It ridicules the stimulus as wasteful and ineffective. And it would be a great zinger if indeed stimulus money had been used to hire someone to get more stimulus money. But that's not supported by the facts. Yes, the city of Washington, N.C., got $40,234 in stimulus money to pay for an employee whose job, in part, will be to pursue federal grant money to help offset the cost of a new police station. But there's a difference between federal grants and the stimulus, and city officials say there doesn't appear to be any stimulus money available for this project. So the ad has a catchy line, but it's not true. We rate it False.	None	John Boehner	None	None	None	2009-07-07T18:40:23	2009-07-02	['North_Carolina']

The fake news headline said, "Washington State Legislature votes to change its name because George Washington owned Slaves." With 50,267 shares as of Sept. 27, the article says that the state is now named "Soros State," after investor and philanthropist, George Soros for, according to the article, all of his help in eliminating the history of slavery in the United States. However, the Soros State does not exist, because the state of Washington did not change its name. The article was made on a site called www.breakingnews365.net. The About section at the bottom of this site states, "This website is an entertainment website, news are created by users. These are humourous news, fantasy, fictional, that should not be seriously taken or as a source of information." (The poor grammar is how it appears on the page.) The main page of www.breakingnews365.net gives users the option to "prank your friends now" and create his or her own article. It also gives users the option to add a photo and suggests that he or she should make titles that would "make your friends curious." There is also an identical website called www.breakingnews247.net that PolitiFact has reported on before. But if you missed the warning at the bottom of the page and the grammar mistakes within the article, there are other ways to disprove the validity of this article. George Soros is the founder of Open Society Foundations, a philanthropic organization devoted to strengthening democracy and protecting marginalized communities. In the past, he advocated for Georgetown University to offer financial aid for African-American students "whose forbears were slaves." But unlike what the story claimed, Soros does not have any apparent history of trying to eliminate the history of slavery in the United States. The breakingnews365.net article does not specify when the special session was that would have approved the name change. The Washington State Legislature adjourned its last special session July 20, 2017. The Washington State Legislature’s report of all the bills passed in 2017 contains no mention of a bill that changes the name or a recent special session.

pomt-04550	"Tea Party Congressman Frank Guinta voted for billions in cuts to veterans programs."	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/sep/27/carol-shea-porter/carol-shea-porter-distorts-frank-guintas-voting-re/	Veterans funding was back in the news recently as the U.S. Senate failed to take up a new veterans jobs bill. But, even before the vote, one New Hampshire congressional candidate was already taking aim over the issue. In a television ad, released Sept. 18 in and around New Hampshire, former Rep. Carol Shea-Porter, who is once again challenging U.S. Rep. Frank Guinta, charged her opponent with failing to support the country’s veterans. "Tea Party Congressman Frank Guinta voted for billions in cuts to veterans programs," a narrator declares in the ad, "Debt,’ aired on WMUR-TV. "I’m Carol Shea-Porter and I approve this message because our veterans deserve better," she said to conclude the ad. Guinta, a freshman Republican, immediately disputed the ad and organized a rally in Manchester to call attention to his "strong record of supporting our veterans." So, who’s right? We decided to check the records. In the ad, the Shea-Porter campaign points to a number of bills, including H.R. 2055, the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, as well as H. Con. Res. 112, the House Republicans’ budget resolution, to support their claim that Guinta voted to cut veterans funding. We’ll look at each one individually. The Military Construction and Veterans Affairs bill was first introduced May 31, 2011. In its original form, the bill proposed about $129.7 billion in funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs -- an increase of about $7.85 billion over the 2011 funding level. In March 2011, the bill passed the House with near unanimous support. Guinta joined 410 other House lawmakers from both sides of the aisle passing the bill June 14, 2011 by a 411-5 count, according to Roll Call 418. But, as it moved to the Senate, the legislation was expanded to include funding for a host of other federal programs and departments, including energy and water, financial services, interior and environment, labor and education, among others. When it returned to the House for a vote Dec. 15, 2011, the final version of the bill, now known as the Consolidated Appropriations Act, proposed about $124.2 billion in funding for the Veterans Affairs department. This figure fell about $5.5 billion below the initial proposal, and $6 billion less than President Barack Obama’s $130.2 billion funding request. But it still exceeded the 2011 veterans figure, $123.16 billion, by nearly $1 billion -- $991 million, to be exact. This time, however, Guinta voted against the bill, saying it failed to go far enough to reduce government spending. According to Roll Call 941, he was one of 86 Republicans to vote against the bill, which passed 296-121. President Barack Obama signed the bill into law Dec. 23, 2011 "Americans simply can’t afford the high price-tag that accompanies this bill," Guinta said at the time in a written statement. "While there are several provisions in it that I strongly support - and have voted for in the past - the overall spending level was just too high." So, in this case, Guinta initially voted to increase veterans funding, but then, when the legislation was expanded to include other spending, he voted against the bill. But voting against an increase isn’t the same as a vote to cut veterans funding. Now, let’s move onto the House Republicans’ budget resolution. U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, chairman of the House budget committee and the Republican vice-presidential nominee, first introduced the spending bill in March to set the budget for Fiscal Year 2013 and the budget projections for the nine years to follow. On March 29, Guinta joined 227 of his fellow congressmen and women in supporting the budget, which passed the House 228-191, along party lines. But, the bill stalled as it moved on to the Democrat-controlled Senate, failing to reach the floor for a vote. The bill Guinta supported set V.A. funding at $134.6 billion for Fiscal Year 2013. That total did not meet the president’s $139.7 billion request, but it exceeded 2012 spending by about $6.5 billion, or 4.9 percent. But, White House officials and political analysts alike note the House Republicans’ budget also includes $798 billion in undefined cuts to discretionary spending. Neither Ryan nor other House Republicans have specified where these cuts would come from, leaving analysts to speculate about their impact. Obama campaign officials note that, if applied evenly across the board, the budget could cost the V.A. $11 billion by 2014. And according to Richard Kogan, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think thank, the department could lose $2 billion in 2013 and $117 billion over the next 10 years, if the cuts were applied proportionally by department. "How much discretionary funding does Ryan propose for fiscal year 2013 or subsequent years for V.A. medical care?" Kogan wrote in an e-mail. "The answer is that we cannot tell, but it is at risk of cuts, perhaps deep cuts. "Importantly, there are no cuts to veterans (specifically outlined) under this view of the budget. But the fact begs the question of where the remaining $897 billion in cuts will come from," he wrote. Our ruling: With $798 billion in unspecified cuts, the Ryan budget leaves many questions, including what effects those cuts will have on veterans spending. But, amid all the questions and uncertainties, what we do know is the budget plan, supported by Guinta, proposed to increase V.A. spending in 2013. We also know that, contrary to Shea-Porter's claim, Guinta voted to increase the V.A. budget by $6 billion when he voted in favor of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs act last year. However, he ultimately voted against the measure when it returned to Congress in the form of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, which added close to a $1 billion in new funding to veterans programs. All things considered, we find it a distortion to say Guinta has voted to cut money for veterans’ programs. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-10610	Obama said that "since 1992, the Republicans have had all the good ideas..."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/21/bill-clinton/obama-not-a-reagan-democrat/	Stumping for his wife, Bill Clinton made an eyebrow-raising attack on Sen. Barack Obama, suggesting Obama's allegiance is with Republican ideas. What? "Her (Hillary's) principal opponent said that since 1992, the Republicans have had all the good ideas," Clinton told a crowd in Pahrump, Nev., on Jan. 18, 2008. "…So now it turns out you can choose between somebody who thinks our ideas are better or the Republicans had all the good ideas." At a campaign rally two days later in Buffalo, N.Y., Bill Clinton revisited the attack: "[Obama] said President Reagan was the engine of innovation and did more, had a more lasting impact on America than I did. And then the next day he said, 'In the '90s, the good ideas came out from the Republicans.' " Here's what Obama actually said: "I do think that, for example, the 1980 election was different," Obama told the editorial board of the Reno Gazette-Journal on Jan. 14. "I mean, I think Ronald Reagan changed the trajectory of America in a way that, you know, Richard Nixon did not and in a way that Bill Clinton did not." And a little later... "I think it's fair to say the Republicans were the party of ideas for a pretty long chunk of time there over the last 10, 15 years, in the sense that they were challenging conventional wisdom." Hillary Clinton also twisted Obama's words. "I have to say, you know, my leading opponent the other day said that he thought the Republicans had better ideas than Democrats the last 10 to 15 years," she said at an economic roundtable in Las Vegas on Jan. 18. Clinton said she didn't consider it a better idea to privatize Social Security, eliminate the minimum wage, undercut health benefits, shut down the government or drive the country into debt. John Edwards piled on, too: "Ronald Reagan, the man who busted unions, the man who did everything in his power to destroy the organized labor movement, the man who created a tax structure that favored the richest Americans against middle class and working families... we know that Ronald Reagan is not an example of change for a presidential candidate running in the Democratic Party." Instead of a long point-by-point comparison of the politics of Obama versus Reagan, let's just put this to bed by giving Obama's comments a fuller context. During the 49-minute editorial board meeting, Obama was essentially asked how long his coattails might be for other candidates in House and Senate races. His response lasted a few minutes, but here's a bit of what he said: "I think that we're shifting the political paradigm here. And if I'm the nominee, I think I can bring a lot of folks along on my coattails. You know, there's a reason why in 2006, I made the most appearances for members of Congress. I was the most requested surrogate to come in and campaign for people in districts that were swing districts, Republican districts where they wouldn't have any other Democrat. "That was based on their read of the fact that, you know what, this is somebody who can reach out to independents and Republicans in a way that doesn't offend people. … I don't want to present myself as some sort of singular figure. I think part of what's different are the times. "I do think that, for example, the 1980 election was different. I mean, I think Ronald Reagan changed the trajectory of America in a way that, you know, Richard Nixon did not and in a way that Bill Clinton did not. He put us on a fundamentally different path because the country was ready for it. They felt like, you know, with all the excesses of the '60s and the '70s and government had grown and grown but there wasn't much sense of accountability in terms of how it was operating and he tapped into what people were already feeling. Which is, people wanted clarity, we want optimism, we want a return to that sense of dynamism and entrepreneurship that had been missing, all right? I think Kennedy, 20 years earlier, moved the country in a fundamentally different direction. So I think a lot of it just has to do with the times. "I think we're in one of those times right now. Where people feel like things as they are going aren't working. We're bogged down in the same arguments that we've been having, and they're not useful." And does this next part sound like a Republican sympathizer? "And, you know, the Republican approach, I think, has played itself out. I think it's fair to say the Republicans were the party of ideas for a pretty long chunk of time there over the last 10, 15 years, in the sense that they were challenging conventional wisdom. Now, you've heard it all before. You look at the economic policies when they're being debated among the presidential candidates and it's all tax cuts. Well, you know, we've done that, we tried it. That's not really going to solve our energy problems, for example. So, some of it's the times. And some of it's, I think, there's maybe a generation element to this, partly ... I didn't come of age in the battles of the '60s. I'm not as invested in them. "And so I think I talk differently about issues. And I think I talk differently about values. And that's why I think we've been resonating with the American people." Steve Falcone, opinion editor for the Reno Gazette-Journal, who led the interview, said he didn't give the comment much thought until it blew up with Bill Clinton's retort. "I was surprised by the way it got spun," Falcone said. "To me, it was in the context of the need for change and leadership," he said. "It was an example that a lot of people can appreciate, that Reagan created a coalition because he had ideas. I didn't think at the time that he was aligning himself with any Republican ideas. It never occurred to me listening to it that he (Obama) was agreeing with the politics of Ronald Reagan." Four days after he visited, the paper endorsed Obama in the Democratic primary. Our take, Obama may want to think twice before invoking the R-word again any time soon. But in this case, it was little more than a sound bite taken out of context and twisted. Obama never said Republicans have all the good ideas. We rate Bill Clinton's statement False. Hillary's too, for that matter.

pomt-08590	Says John Boehner "admits 'we are not going to be any different than we’ve been' " by returning to "the same failed economic policies" that "wrecked our economy."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/24/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-cites-john-boehner-saying-gop-plans-r/	In their effort to hold a congressional majority, Democrats keep saying that if the Republicans take power, they will return to the policies of former President George W. Bush and the previous Republican majority in Congress -- policies that Democrats blame for helping cause the current recession. The office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., used this argument in responding to a Sept. 23, 2010, event in which House Republicans unveiled a "Pledge to America" -- a statement of policy principles that House Republicans intend follow. A Sept. 23 post on Pelosi's "Gavel" blog said, "Answering a question this morning about the preamble to the GOP’s ‘Pledge to America,’ House Republican Leader John Boehner admitted to American workers, their families and small businesses, 'We are not going to be any different than we’ve been.' Finally, we get the truth. Congressional Republicans want to return to the same failed economic policies that cost us 8 million American jobs, doubled our national debt, hurt millions of Americans, and wrecked our economy." The post included an eight-second video clip in which Boehner says, "And the point we make in this preamble to our Pledge is that we're not going to be any different than we've been." We wanted to see if Pelosi's post accurately reflected what Boehner, an Ohio Republican, had said at the event. So we listened to the audio recording of the question-and-answer session from which the quote was taken. Here's the full question and answer: Question: "Legislatively, how do you plan to honor families, traditional marriage, life and the private and faith-based organizations that form the core of our American values?" Boehner: "I think if you look at House Republicans over the course of the last year, two years -- for that matter, the last 10 years -- you will see that, by and large, we have supported those pro-family, traditional values issues. And the point we make in this preamble to our Pledge is that we are not going to be any different than what we've been. We are going to stand up for those things that we believe in." So Boehner was not in fact talking about the party's economic policies. He was answering a question about what he called "pro-family, traditional values issues." Those are two very different things, and the extremely tight editing of the eight-second clip in Pelosi's blog post suggests to us that whoever edited the clip realized that Boehner's full answer would not have made the point they wanted to make. Others have found plenty to criticize about the Republican plan. On the Daily Show, Jon Stewart mocked Republican comments at the Pledge event by intersplicing them with nearly identical statements made by GOP leaders in the past. But it's a gross mischaracterization to make that point by touting Boehner's comment and saying that he was referring to economic policy. Pelosi's office told us they think it's fair to interpret his words broadly. "Leader Boehner, like others in his party, may wish to take his statement back, but he was clearly in an event, speaking about the Republican agenda when he said it," said Pelosi spokesman Nadeam Elshami. "The preamble is a prelude to the pledge, which is a roadmap right back to failed policies of the past." That's an opinion that many Democrats share, but we still feel that the Speaker's office significantly distorted Boehner's comments. Even if you believe that the Republicans would indeed return to Bush-era economic policies, it does not justify making that point by twisting Boehner's comment, which was specifically tailored to social issues. Nor does it justify running a video clip that is highly abbreviated and removes all context from Boehner's statement. For these reasons, we rate the blog post Pants on Fire.

pomt-11427	"Putin issues international arrest warrant for Soros"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/mar/16/viralpoliticsus/no-proof-putin-issued-arrest-warrant-soros/	Billionaire George Soros is now officially a wanted man in Russia, a viral story would have you believe. "Putin issues international arrest warrant for Soros," reads a March 10 headline on Viral Politics US. The story smashes together work by Soros groups in Russia and quotes from a Rolling Stone article that have nothing to do with Soros to create an inaccurate hoax. While Russia banned two Soros charities in 2015, we found no evidence that it issued a warrant for his arrest. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. Similar hoaxes about Soros and Putin have circulated since November 2016. Soros is a hedge fund manager who has supported liberal causes and backed Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. He has been the target of many online hoaxes, including that President Donald Trump declared Soros a "national security threat". Viral Politics US stated that Russia declared Soros and his organizations a "threat to Russian national security." That phrase is similar to the language used by Russian officials when they banned two Soros charities in 2015. "It was found that the activity of the Open Society Foundations and the Open Society Institute Assistance Foundation represents a threat to the foundations of the constitutional system of the Russian Federation and the security of the state," stated a translated version of a press statement by Russia's General Prosecutor's Office in November 2015. The Viral Politics US story pulls actual quotes from a 2010 Rolling Stone article about Goldman Sachs including this quote: "The world’s most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money." Although the Rolling Stone article makes no mention of Soros, the Viral Politics US story tries to create a connection by stating "obviously Soros wants to be like Goldman Sachs." Viral Politics US then tosses in a quote by a man named Phil Butler: "George Soros has a finger in every political pie there is. If there is a crisis on our world, it’s a safe bet he’s had a hand in it,’" Viral Politics US wrote. The online hoax provides no explanation about the identity of Butler, but we found the quote by Butler in an article for the online magazine New Eastern Outlook in July 2016. Butler described Soros as a "real arch villain" and accused Soros of manipulating the 2016 presidential election. Butler describes himself as an analyst and expert on Eastern Europe. While there is no evidence that Putin sought a warrant to arrest Soros, the billionaire has been a major critic of the Russian president and said he believes that Putin has been behind the attacks on him. In January while speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Soros said, "Open societies are in crisis, and various forms of dictatorships and mafia states, exemplified by Putin’s Russia, are on the rise." In October 2016, Soros criticized Putin for Russia's bombing campaign in Syria calling on him to "put an end to his heinous crimes against humanity." Viral Politics US wrote that "Putin issues international arrest warrant for Soros." While Russia banned two Soros charities in 2015, we found no evidence that Putin issued a warrant for the billionaire’s arrest. We rate this headline Pants on Fire.

pomt-11543	"Food stamp enrollment drops by four million in one month."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2018/feb/12/breitbart/food-stamps-dropped-nationally-after-temporary-spi/	The number of people on food stamps plummeted nationwide in November, according to Breitbart, a conservative news website. "Food stamp enrollment drops by four million in one month," stated the Feb. 7 headline. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found that the numbers are accurate, but as the story explained, the decline occurred after a spike as a result of a program to temporarily provide food stamps to people in areas damaged by hurricanes. Ultimately, the number of food stamp clients in November was on par with many of the preceding months before the impacts of Hurricane Irma in Florida and Hurricane Harvey in Texas. Data showed spike followed by decline in food stamps in the fall The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is a federal government program to help low-income people buy groceries. The average per person monthly benefit was around $126 last year. Breitbart accurately quoted monthly data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture which showed that the number of participants in SNAP dropped from about 45.7 million in October 2017 to 41.7 million in November 2017 — a decrease of about four million. Breitbart explained that the decline was preceded by an increase following temporary Disaster-SNAP enrollment in Florida and Texas after the hurricanes. Food stamp clients jumped by about three million between September and October nationwide after the USDA approved Disaster-SNAP for Florida and Texas. Jessica Sims, a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Children and Families, said that DCF handed out these disaster benefits to 3.1 million people between late September and early December. In Texas, there were 1.6 million individuals served. SNAP acts as a first responder after natural disasters, providing assistance to households that may be vulnerable as a result of their place of employment temporarily closing, or facing expenses due to damage or relocation, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. Breitbart’s statement about the four-million drop in one month makes for a catchy headline, but if we put it in context and look at the data over a few months, it showed that the November enrollment of about 41.7 million is in the same ballpark as many of the past several months, for example in May when there were 41.6 million SNAP clients. Experts told PolitiFact that monthly enrollment can fluctuate due to factors such as disaster assistance, so it’s more useful to look at longer stretches such as annual data to understand trends. Food stamps on the decline since 2013 Breitbart accurately noted that food stamp enrollment has been on the decline since fiscal year 2013. Annual SNAP data shows enrollment climbed from about 28.2 million in 2008 to 47.6 million in 2013 and has declined every year since that time. SNAP enrollment hit 42.2 million in 2017. SNAP enrollment fluctuates based on the economy. National enrollment climbed between 2007 and 2013 amid the recession and sluggish initial recovery. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The rising numbers were as a result of expanded eligibility and outreach, which began under President George W. Bush including a commitment to expand funding. Also, the 2009 stimulus package signed by President Barack Obama expanded eligibility. So far there have been no explicit changes implemented to SNAP since Trump took office in January 2017 to give him credit for the decline, said James Ziliak, director of the center for Poverty Research at the University of Kentucky. "To the extent that the economy has continued to grow under President Trump, including rising wages, then to the extent that his policies have not interfered with this pre-existing trend he deserves some credit," he said. The Trump administration has made some moves toward work requirements for people who receive certain government services, including food stamps. Trump’s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, said at a press conference in May 2017 that people need to get a job to be eligible for food stamps going forward: "If you’re on food stamps and you’re able-bodied, then we need you to go to work," he said. The federal government has sought input from the states in an effort to promote employment for food stamp recipients. According to the USDA, many SNAP households already have a person working. Nearly one-third of all SNAP households and 55 percent of households with children had earnings in 2015. We emailed the Breitbart reporter and did not get a reply. Our ruling Breitbart said that "Food stamp enrollment drops by four million in one month." Data from the USDA showed that the number of SNAP participants dropped from about 45.7 million in October to 41.7 million in November, a decrease of about four million. But as Breitbart explained, there was a temporary spike in enrollment due to Disaster-SNAP, including in Florida, as a result of a hurricane. In general, comparing two months doesn’t tell us much about longer-term trends. But Breitbart noted that food stamps have declined since 2013, which is accurate. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-01125	Regarding sexual assault against women, "It’s actually safer not to be in college than it is to be in college."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2015/jan/04/mark-warner/warner-sexual-assualt-its-safer-women-not-be-colle/	U.S Sen. Mark Warner says women in college have a greater risk of being sexually assaulted than those who don’t go. Warner made that statement in a television interview while weighing in on a Rolling Stone article that detailed allegations of a gang rape at a University of Virginia fraternity. The magazine has since backed away from the story. "Statistics show that one out of every five women are victims of sexual assault when they’re on college campuses," Warner said on Fusion. "It’s actually safer not to be in college than it is to be in college." PolitiFact Virginia examined the one-in-five statistic recently while looking at a statement made by State Sen. Richard Saslaw, D-Fairfax. We found debate among analysts over that figure. What piqued our interest this time is Warner’s claim that women college students are at a greater risk of being sexually assaulted than their non-college peers, a statement he’s made several times. Warner’s proof Warner spokesman, Kevin Hall, said the senator’s comment was based on a pair of Department of Justice reports as well as a statement from the American Association of University Professors about sexual assault. "Schools are not the safe havens they once appeared to be; college women are at higher risk for sexual assault than their non-college-bound peers," said a 2005 report on campus sexual assault by the U.S. Department of Justice’s National Institute of Justice. NIJ based its conclusion on an early 1997 survey when it asked 4,446 female college students in the U.S. whether they’d been sexually victimized since the start of that school year. Almost 16 percent of the women said they had experienced "victimization," a term that was defined as anything from unwanted touching to forcible rape. But the researchers never surveyed women who were not students. To support their finding that college women are at greater risk of experiencing a sexual crime, they cited academic studies in the late 1980s and 1990s that examined sexual assault on campuses in the U.S. and Canada. One of the studies, published in the journal Criminology, surveyed 3,472 women students at 12 U.S. colleges about sexual victimization during the 1993-1994 academic year. They found that the rate of rape and sexual assault among students on campus was about three times higher than that of all women age 20-24. The researchers -- professors at three universities -- said their results "were suggestive" of a higher rate of sexual assault among college females. But the researchers cautioned that firm conclusions couldn’t be drawn without a systematic study of sexual assault among college students as well and their non-student peers. They, too, did not survey non-students, instead relying on information from the National Crime Victimization Survey. This produced uneven comparisons. And the age range of the women students interviewed by the professors didn’t exactly match the available national data for women ages 20 to 24. What Warner overlooks Warner’s office didn’t mention two studies by another branch of the Justice Department -- the Bureau of Justice Statistics -- that contradictorily concluded college women are safer than their non-college peers. These reports are somewhat more current than the research Warner cited and surveyed identically-aged women, from 18 through 24, attending college and not. The bureau, in a 2003 study, found that from 1995 to 2000 the rape and sexual assault rate among female college students was 6.2 per 1,000 women. The rape and sexual assault rate among female non-students was 7.9 per 1,000. In a follow-up study in 2005, the bureau found that from 1995-2002, the rate of rape and sexual assault was 6.0 per 1,000 women students compared to 7.9 per 1,000 for female non-students. We should point out that on Dec. 11, 2014 -- about a week after Warner made his statement -- the Bureau of Justice Statistics released its first report since 2005 examining sexual assault among women in college and their non-student peers. That report found that from 1995 to 2013, the rate of rape and sexual assault for students was 6.1 per 1,000 compared to 7.6 per 1,000 for non-students. We won’t hold Warner accountable for information released a week after he made his statement. But the previous bureau reports from 2003 and 2005, that contradicted Warner’s claim, were available when he made his statement. You may note that the incidences of campus rape and sexual assault in the bureau studies are lower than those found in other research we’ve mentioned. The bureau says that’s because it conducts a crime survey and its definitions of an offense are narrower than those used in other surveys. The bureau says participants in its survey may not report incidents they don’t think rise to the level of crimes. A statistician at the bureau said the tighter definitions do not diminish its findings. "It’s the only national survey where you can look at the comparison between the students and non-students in terms of violent victimization and sexual assault victimization," said Lynn Langdon, co-author of the recent report. Why would non-college students have higher rates of sexual assault than colleges students? "A likely culprit is disadvantage," emailed Callie Rennison, a former statistician at the bureau who is co-director of the Criminology and Justice Research Initiative at the University of Colorado’s School of Public Affairs. "In general, individuals who have more income, greater education, live in better-off communities (among other things) tend to be characterized by lower rates of violence," she wrote. "I believe this translates to university attendance. That is, those who come from more advantage are also more likely to attend university." A final note: Warner, who has three college-aged daughters, voiced concern about sexual assaults on campuses prior to the publication of the Rolling Stone’s article in November. The senator announced in July that he was cosponsoring a bill that seeks to crack down on campus sexual assault. The measure would require colleges to designate confidential advisors to help victims report crimes. It would mandate an annual anonymous survey in which students at every university would be asked about the prevalence of sexual assaults at their campuses. Our ruling Warner says women students on college campuses are more likely to be sexually assaulted than their peers who don’t seek a higher education. He backs his statement by citing Department of Justice studies that make that same observation based on research from the 1980s and 90s. The researchers acknowledged shortcomings with their methodology and said their conclusions were "suggestive." Warner’s statement ignores a credible and more current body of research that offered an opposite conclusion to his. We rate his statement Mostly False.

"BREAKING: President Trump Pardons Kim Davis," read the headline on an Aug. 26, 2017, post on OurLandOfTheFree.com. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to cut down on fake news. The post appeared after Trump’s Aug. 25 pardon of Arpaio, the former sheriff of Maricopa County, Ariz. Arpaio had been found guilty of criminal contempt after he continued to illegally profile Latinos against a judge’s orders. His sentencing was set for Oct. 5. Davis, meanwhile, was the Rowan County, Ken., clerk who had in 2015 refused to sign marriage licenses for same-sex couples on religious grounds, in defiance of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling. A federal judge sent her to jail for five days for contempt of court for not complying with an order to issue the licenses. Her deputy clerks were eventually allowed to sign the licenses; Kentucky later took county clerks’ names off marriage licenses. She had faced three lawsuits for her refusal, but the suits had been dismissed. The same judge who jailed her later ruled that in one case, the state of Kentucky and not Davis was responsible for paying $225,000 in legal fees for the couple that brought the suit. So Davis can’t get a pardon, because technically she wasn’t convicted of a federal crime. But it doesn’t matter, because we know that the website that posted the story makes up all its content. OurLandOfTheFree.com is a parody site that, like other sites that created stories we’ve debunked, attempts to fool conservatives with absurd stories.

pomt-07831	The United States is "the only developed country in the world that has not cut its corporate tax rate."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2011/feb/15/herman-cain/obama-should-cut-corporate-tax-rate-potential-gop-/	The next presidential election is just 21 months away, and one potential candidate from Georgia was recently on national television to make an interesting case against incumbent Barack Obama. Herman Cain, a conservative businessman, motivational speaker, author and former radio talk show host, said on CNN that the president does not fully understand how to help the private sector prosper. Case in point, Cain said, the high corporate tax rates the federal government levies on businesses. "We need to lower the top corporate tax rates from 35 percent to 25 percent," Cain said Friday on CNN’s "American Morning" program. "We are the only developed country in the world that has not cut its corporate tax rate." Cain, a Henry County resident who unsuccessfully campaigned for a U.S. Senate seat in 2004, recently started an exploratory presidential committee, the customary first step toward a White House bid. Cain concedes he would be a "dark-horse" candidate, but we’re certain he would get his message out if he runs for president. So we were curious about Cain’s claim on CNN. Is the United States the only developed country in the world that has not cut its corporate tax rate, the percentage that businesses are taxed by the government? The best information on the subject comes from the Doing Business Project, which was started in 2002 to examine business regulations across the globe. Its partners include the World Bank. Each year, the project completes a report that looks at the world’s business climate. AJC PolitiFact Georgia read each one of the project’s Paying Taxes reports, which date back to 2007. During that time frame, we found 48 nations that have cut back their corporate tax rates. The reports do not specify whether the cuts were to statutory rates, which is the taxable income of corporations, or effective rates, which measure the taxes a corporation pays as a percentage of its economic profit. The larger countries that cut their rates included Canada, China, Germany, Israel, Italy, Mexico, Russia and South Africa. The list included small nations, such as Albania, Colombia, Denmark, the Dominican Republic, Ghana, Morocco and New Zealand. The United States was not among those countries. During the period covered by the reports, Iceland was the only developed country that raised its corporate tax rate, which increased from 15 percent to 18 percent. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center has a chart of America’s corporate tax rate that dates back to 1909. It shows the top rate was at its highest, 52.8 percent, in 1968 and 1969. It was last cut between 1987 and 1988, when Ronald Reagan was president, from 40 percent to 34 percent. The top rate last rose in 1993, to its current rate of 35 percent. Some research shows corporate tax revenue typically increases when the rates are lowered because more businesses pay the rates. Cain is not the only conservative to call for a lower corporate tax rate. U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., proposed lowering the top rate from 35 percent to 25 percent during his failed bid for president in 2008. McCain and others complain that the U.S. has among the highest corporate tax rates in the world. PolitiFact rated a claim by U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., that America has the world’s highest corporate tax rate as Mostly True. Obama, by the way, said in last month’s State of the Union address he is open to cutting the top corporate tax rate. The president said in that speech that the U.S. had among the world’s highest corporate tax rates, earning him a True by PolitiFact on the Truth-O-Meter. Emory University law school professor Dorothy Brown contends this point stressed by Cain and others is a red herring. She and others argue that the federal tax code contains many loopholes for businesses that allow them to pay less in corporate taxes. "I quarrel whether there is any meaning," Brown said. "The question is so what?" The big question for us is what time frame was Cain talking about on CNN when he said the U.S. is the only developed country that has notcut its corporate tax rate? The Tax Policy Center chart tells a different story. Efforts to contact Cain via telephone and e-mail were unsuccessful Monday. It has been a while since the United States cut its corporate tax rate. But to say the U.S. is the "only developed country" that has not cut its corporate tax rate is not completely accurate. At least one other one -- Iceland -- has raised the rates. Arguments can be made, however, that Iceland is an anomaly when its economy is compared to major players like the U.S. We believe Cain is trying to make a larger point that many developed countries have lowered their corporate taxes. He argues they should be lowered here in order for America to be competitive with the rest of the world. There is ample evidence that the U.S. is behind the curve on this front, but not everyone is cutting their rates. We find Cain’s statement, and the larger point he is trying to make, is on-point. But he omits important details in the quest to make that point. We rate his statement Half True.	None	Herman Cain	None	None	None	2011-02-15T06:00:00	2011-02-11	['United_States']

Some groups are using risque tactics to draw attention to their opposition, like the student-organized "Campus Dildo Carry" day, scheduled to take place next summer at the University of Texas in Austin. Gun Free UT, which opposes the law, is taking a more serious approach in its opposition, in part through a website that drew our attention thanks to this claim posted Oct. 28, 2015: "29 mass shootings have been committed by concealed carriers since 2007, while during this period only one (1) licensed civilian meaningfully intervened in a mass shooting." The same day, we took a screenshot of the blog post containing the claim, headlined "Guns in Classrooms: Report from the trenches and tasks." After we asked for some clarification on the relationship between the two sources cited in the claim, the post was taken down. Joan Neuberger, UT professor of history and a co-chair of the Gun Free UT steering committee, said the claim made on the site in a bullet point left no room for nuance. "We can see that our statement needs more context." Still, is the claim -- suggesting mass shooters won’t be stopped even if more students carry weapons -- accurate? We looked first at whether 29 mass shootings have been committed by licensed concealed carriers since 2007. Then we turned to whether only one licensed civilian "meaningfully" intervened in a mass shooting in the period. Counting mass shootings In an Oct. 28, 2015 post, The Washington Post’s Wonkblog cited an Oct. 14, 2015 report from the Violence Policy Center, a research and advocacy group that promotes gun control, stating that since 2007, there had been 29 mass shootings by people with concealed weapons in the U.S. The National Rifle Association, which backed SB 11, has taken issue with the center’s breakdown. NRA Institute for Legislative Action spokesman Lars Dalseide directed us to a criticism of the center’s methodology on Bearing Arms, a Second Amendment rights advocacy blog. The Oct. 26, 2015 Bearing Arms post looks at each of the shootings compiled by the center and concludes that only six instances were actually mass shootings committed by concealed carry permit holders using concealed weapons. That’s a whopping difference. So what gives? For one thing, the Violence Policy Center and Bearing Arms define "mass shootings" differently. In its analysis, the center defined a mass shooting as the killing of three people or more. According to VPC Communications Director Avery Palmer, this definition is "consistent with the federal definition contained in the Investigative Assistance for Violent Crimes Act of 2012." This is also the definition used in "A Study of Active Shooter Incidents in the United States Between 2000 and 2013," the FBI report from which Gun Free UT pulls its statistic on civilian interventions. On the other hand, the Bearing Arms post author, Bob Owens, defines a mass killing as the killing of four people or more, thus disregarding incidents in which three people were killed. His definition is actually consistent with the FBI definition of a mass murder (as opposed to a mass shooting). In a 2005 report on serial murder, the FBI defined mass murder as "a number of murders (four or more) occurring during the same incident." Only one civilian intervened? We come to the second part of the claim, that "during this period (since 2007), only one licensed civilian meaningfully intervened in a mass shooting." Gun Free UT pulls this figure from the aforementioned FBI study on active-shooter incidents. It’s worth noting that while Gun Free UT implies the FBI report contains data on interventions from 2007 through the present, it actually only examines incidents through 2013. According to the report, there were five instances in which "the shooting ended after armed individuals who were not law enforcement personnel exchanged gunfire with the shooters." Gun Free UT did not count four of these incidents because the intervening civilians were security guards armed for their jobs. When we took a closer look at the one case where an armed civilian stopped the shooting, we found something interesting. The FBI report didn’t just look at mass shootings -- it focused on all "active shooter incidents" (in which "an individual actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a confined and populated area") during a 13-year period. As it turns out, the situation cited by Gun Free UT was not what either the center or the FBI would define as a mass shooting in that two people died, rather than three. In that case, Ernesto Villagomez, 30, killed two people and wounded two more inside Player’s Bar and Grill in Winnemucca, Nevada. He was then shot and killed by another patron at the bar. Other analyses Unlike the FBI report, the center’s analysis considered only mass shootings committed by concealed carry permit holders. A third tally of mass shootings, published Dec. 15, 2012 by the left-leaning Mother Jones magazine, found there had been 62 mass shootings over 30 years, with not a single case in which the killing was stopped by a civilian with a gun. The Mother Jones investigation used the more restrictive "mass murder definition"-- four or more killed at once in its count of shootings. Meantime, the Wonkblog post that cited the center’s shooting count reached its own -- higher -- tally of eight instances that someone with a concealed-carry license intervened in a mass shooting situation. That count was attributed to an Oct. 3, 2015, Washington Post blog post, by UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh; two more incidents were added later to his list. In his post, Volokh acknowledged that the effect of more widespread gun possession on the outcome of mass shootings remains unknown. Of his examples, he conceded "at least some examples are ambiguous, because it might be unclear… whether the shooter had been planning to kill more people when he was stopped." By either FBI definition, the death toll only climbed high enough to count as a mass shooting in one of the 10 incidents identified by Volokh. In all the others, it is unsure whether the shooter would have continued shooting had he not been shot himself, making it difficult to do an authoritative count of interventions. For instance, in a 2014 incident at Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital near Philadelphia, a psychiatric patient shot his caseworker in the face and wounded his psychiatrist before the psychiatrist shot him. He was then wrestled to the ground. The shooter, Richard S. Plott, had more than 30 additional rounds of ammunition on him when he was stopped. There are drawbacks to any attempt to compile and compare statistics from different sources; there’s also a good reason comprehensive data on gun violence is hard to come by. Since 1996, Congress has restricted research into gun violence with a budget that states: "None of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control." The CDC read the restriction broadly and radically reduced research on gun violence as a result; Obama reversed the funding rule by executive order in 2013. Our Ruling When we looked, the Gun Free UT blog included this claim: "29 mass shootings have been committed by concealed carriers since 2007, while during this period only one (1) licensed civilian meaningfully intervened in a mass shooting." The first Gun Free UT claim is accurate in that in that 29 mass shootings, according to a definition provided by the FBI, were carried out by people with concealed weapons. An attempt by Bearing Arms to refute the claim calls the incidents mass killings, but uses the FBI definition for mass murder. The claims leaves out information that could clarify the tangle of definitions used. By Gun Free UT's own admission, the website claim lacks context. The second claim that only one licensed civilian intervened in a mass shooting is false by the FBI definition of a mass shooting, but bolsters Gun Free UT’s cause because no armed civilian has intervened in a mass shooting. We rate this claim Half True.	None	Gun Free UT Gun Free UT	None	None	None	2015-11-23T16:29:54	2015-10-29	['None']
pomt-14051	"The University of Wisconsin System budget is the biggest it has ever been."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/may/25/scott-walker/scott-walker-who-cut-funds-wisconsin-university-sy/	The 2015-’16 academic year ended with pomp, circumstance -- and skirmishes between Gov. Scott Walker and professors in the University of Wisconsin System. Walker, irked by no-confidence votes faculty are taking against the system’s leadership, fired attacks on University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee professors (including one we rated Pants on Fire). Several days later, on May 16, 2016, Walker kept up the offensive in an interview on WTMJ-AM in Milwaukee. "We have some of the best schools in the country, no doubt about it," Walker told conservative talk show host Charlie Sykes. "But we’ve got to stop feeding into this national perception that how much you pay in tuition suddenly is a correlation to what the value is. Yeah, you want to have a reasonable level of support for the system; and we do. "In fact, by the way," Walker continued, "the University of Wisconsin System budget is the biggest it has ever been. The amount of money they get from state government is only a fraction of what they have overall. So, for all this hysteria out there, they have never had more money to spend in the UW System." With the 2015-’17 state budget, Walker and his fellow Republicans in the Legislature cut $250 million over the two years from the UW System. That was an 11 percent reduction in state support and a big reason for the no-confidence votes. So, we wondered about Walker’s claim that UW System’s budget is the biggest it’s ever been. He’s essentially correct, but with some caveats. ‘All-funds’ budget Walker was referring to the system’s all-funds budget -- which, as the name suggests, is comprehensive. It includes state tax dollars, but also an array of other funds, such as tuition, revenue from enterprises such as dormitories and athletics, federal research dollars and gifts. We asked for budget figures from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau for the entire history of the UW System, which began in 1973-'74. Here’s a look at the last six years, when the figures were highest. Year All-funds budget -- actual All-funds budget -- adjusted for inflation 2010-’11 $5.591 billion $6.077 billion 2011-’12 $5.589 billion $5.889 billion 2012-’13 $5.901 billion $6.092 billion 2013-’14 $5.997 billion $6.101 billion 2014-’15 $6.098 billion $6.105 billion 2015-’16 $6.194 billion* $6.059 billion As you might expect, the current all-funds budget (2015-’16) is the largest on record. But with an asterisk. That’s because in 2015-’16, for the first time, the UW System included unspent tuition money carried over from the previous year in its all-funds budget. If that money wasn’t included, the 2015-’16 all-funds budget would have been $6.059 billion -- the second-highest ever, behind 2014-’15, rather than $6.194 billion. Adjusted for inflation -- a better measure for comparing figures over time -- the 2015-’16 all funds budget is slightly smaller than in four of the five previous years, but still near the top. State support Walker made it clear his claim was about total funding for the UW System, and that state money covers only a portion of the system’s budget. But it’s worth noting that, adjusted for inflation, state support of the system -- known as general purpose revenue -- is in a historic decline, according to figures from the fiscal bureau. The highest state support, adjusted for inflation, was in the first year of the system, 1973-’74 -- at just under $1.52 billion. That figure hit an all-time low of $1.03 billion in 2015-’16. UW System officials often cite the reduction in state support because they have generally have more flexibility in spending state tax dollars than with revenues that are designated for certain purposes. Our rating Walker said: "The University of Wisconsin System budget is the biggest it has ever been." The system’s 2015-’16 all-funds budget -- which includes not only state tax dollars but federal funds, tuition and other income -- is $6.194 billion, the biggest since the system was created in 1973-’74. But adjusted for inflation, the 2015-’16 all-funds budget is among the biggest, though not the biggest. And the 2015-’16 figure includes unspent tuition revenue that hadn’t been counted in the all-funds budget in previous years. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/81a949f8-1bd5-4d36-b133-2b1bc7d897bf	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2016-05-25T05:00:00	2016-05-16	['None']
pomt-13867	Says Hillary Clinton "savaged" the dignity of people who accused Bill Clinton of sexual harassment or assault "and shamed them."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/06/america-rising-now/pro-trump-super-pac-compares-bill-clinton-cosby-at/	Donald Trump has often attacked Hillary Clinton’s treatment of women by accusing her of enabling former president Bill Clinton’s sexual impropriety. A new ad from pro-Trump super PAC Rebuilding America Now did the same, citing tweets, excerpts from a New York Times article and Hillary Clinton’s own words. Referring to Bill Clinton's accusers, the ad claims that Hillary Clinton "stage-managed their destruction from a White House war room. She savaged their dignity and shamed them." The video attributes several quotations to Hillary Clinton, which we’ll explore later. We fact checked each individually to see if any were taken out of context. But before that, there’s some history you need to understand. Accusations The Washington Post published a guide to Bill Clinton’s alleged impropriety, dividing claims against him into alleged consensual acts and alleged harassment or assault. Five women have alleged consensual affairs, and three others harassment or assault, according to the Post. Bill Clinton has not been found guilty in any court of the accusations. Sources other than the Washington Post — such as the conservative website Breitbart — have higher numbers on how many women Clinton allegedly assaulted or harassed. The pro-Trump video does not name specific women, and a spokesperson for the super PAC declined to go into more detail. Experts we reached out to had opposing views on both the ad’s overarching message and on the substance of the alleged incidents. We didn't weigh in on those issues. What we could fact-check, however, was whether the ad accurately depicted Hillary Clinton’s quotes. Let’s go one by one. The ‘Cosby’ tweet The ad says, "When Bill Cosby was accused of sexual assault, Mrs. Clinton tweeted, ‘Every survivor of sexual assault deserves to be believe.’ " The ad initially references a Nov. 22, 2015, Hillary Clinton tweet on sexual assault. The text of the tweet is accurate. She made similar claims at a rally two weeks later, adding that survivors ought to be believed until "disbelieved" by evidence. But the tweet is not easily identifiable as a direct reference to Cosby. The tweet itself links to Clinton’s plans to tackle sexual assault in college. This might not be a coincidence — CNN aired a version of a documentary on campus assault the same day. The Cosby allegations were in the news at the time, although we were unable to find any specific Cosby-related incident that day. The closest was on Nov. 13, when four women joined a defamation lawsuit against the comedian. No evidence from the tweet itself, however, directly suggests she responded to Cosby. ‘Loony toon’ The ad, turning to allegations against Bill Clinton, said Hillary Clinton called her husband’s accusers "loony toon." The "loony toon" comment comes from the diaries of Diane Blair, a former University of Arkansas professor and friend of the Clintons. According to those notes, Hillary Clinton referred to Monica Lewinsky — whom the Post lists as a consensual affair — as a "narcissistic loony toon." The citation is correctly attributed to Blair’s diaries. The accuracy of what Blair wrote is impossible to determine. The ad claims Clinton was referring to sexual assault accusers, but she was speaking of only one woman — Lewinsky. Experts had differing takes on whether the "Lewinsky affair" was consensual or not. ‘Floozy, bimbo and stalker’ The ad says "The Clinton effort used words like ‘floozy, bimbo and stalker.' " Note, it does not say Clinton said these words — which she didn't. The terms are found in a book — Target: Caught in the Crosshairs of Bill and Hillary Clinton — by Kathleen Willey, a woman who accused Bill Clinton of groping her. The language is also found in a New York Times article. In the book, Willey writes that Robert Bennett — Bill Clinton’s former lawyer — referred to her in conversations with CBS producers as a "floozy, bimbo flake." The book attributes the "stalker" remark to Sidney Blumenthal — a former White House aide — speaking with author Christopher Hitchens. The quotations do come from an identifiable source, but again it is impossible to determine whether the quotes themselves are accurate. ‘A lot to answer for’ The ad claims that referring to the women, Hillary Clinton said "some folks are going to have a lot to answer for." The comment comes from a Today show interview with Matt Lauer on Jan. 27, 1998, soon after news of the Lewinsky affair broke. Lauer asks Clinton about her role defending her husband. "The great story here for anybody willing to find it and write about it and explain it is this vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president," Clinton said. She goes on to note prior attempts to shut down her husband’s political aspirations, eventually declaring the allegations are "not going to be proven true." "And I think that when all of this is put into context, and we really look at the people involved here, look at their motivations and look at their backgrounds, look at their past behavior, some folks are going to have a lot to answer for," she said. This could be interpreted as targeting the women making the accusations, but alternatively it could also be targeting various "right-wing" political operatives based on the interview’s prior context. The Washington Post’s Fact Checker, which previously looked into the ad, noted the ambiguity. A spokesman for the pro-Trump PAC acknowledged it as well, but found their interpretation plausible based on books alleging Clinton mistreated female accusers. The ad claims Clinton was questioning the accounts of the women involved. Going back to the source, that is not certain. The Clinton camp declined to go on record for this fact-check. Our ruling A pro-Trump advertisement makes several claims about Hillary Clinton’s hypocritical treatment of women, relying primarily on her own words or those of close confidants. The broader message — that Clinton enabled her husband’s alleged sexual assaults — has been and continues to be debated, by pundits and experts alike. We didn't weigh in on those arguments, but we did look into the ad’s more specific use of quotes attributed to Clinton. The quotes themselves are hearsay in some cases and subject to different interpretations based on context. The ad further misleads by saying Hillary Clinton "savaged" the dignity of people who accused Bill Clinton of sexual harassment or assault "and shamed them." We rate this claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/26258019-ded0-4ed2-aec3-33d9bb6b14d6	None	Rebuilding America Now	None	None	None	2016-07-06T12:00:00	2016-06-23	['Bill_Clinton']
pomt-15162	Says "Bush Jr. handed Obama a $1.4 trillion deficit" and Obama "reduced Bush Jr.’s deficit to just $492 billion."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/27/occupy-democrats/liberal-group-blames-bush-raising-deficits-credits/	During the last four presidencies, deficits disappeared under one Democrat (Bill Clinton), went up under two Republicans (George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush) and traveled both up and down under one Democrat (Barack Obama). It’s actually a pretty complicated story, but the liberal advocacy group Occupy Democrats boiled it down into one graphic on Facebook with five short lines. "Bush Sr. handed Clinton a $269 billion budget deficit. Clinton handed Bush Jr. a $127.3 billion surplus. Bush Jr. handed Obama a $1.4 trillion deficit. Obama has reduced Bush Jr.’s deficit to just $492 billion. But tell me again which is the party of fiscal responsibility." Facebook users shared this post over 145,000 times, so we thought we’d take a closer look. We asked the group’s founder and editor-in-chief Omar Rivero to explain his numbers, and he offered a small correction. Rivero said the number for the first President Bush should be a deficit of $255 billion, or $14 billion less than stated. "A tiny error, really," Rivero said. "We stand firmly by our meme and its implication that Democrats are better stewards of the debt." We’ll set aside the bigger point and just focus on the numbers and the challenge of awarding credit or placing blame on the person in the Oval Office. In particular, we zero in on the claim that "Bush Jr. handed Obama a $1.4 trillion deficit" and Obama "reduced Bush Jr.’s deficit to just $492 billion." Rivero said he picked the first year of a new president’s first term and relied on data from the White House Office of Management and Budget. We used figures from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, which runs an interactive database for this figure for the Federal Reserve, but the two were largely the same. We color coded the four presidencies and marked the years Rivero picked in red. Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis For the framework Rivero used, and making allowances for his correction, his numbers are fine. In fact, in terms of reducing the deficit, Obama did a little better than the meme said. We should mention the timing of budgets and administrations. The federal fiscal year begins in October. A new president takes office in January and for the most part, typically operates under the budget he inherited. Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist, said for that reason, it’s "reasonable" to use the years that Rivero picked. But there’s a lot more to be said. 2009: Not your typical year The Great Recession hit hard in 2008 and grew worse in 2009. In that period, the unemployment rate doubled from about 5 percent to 10 percent. With Democrats in charge of both houses of Congress and the White House, Washington passed a stimulus package that cost nearly $190 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That included over $100 billion in new spending and a somewhat smaller amount in tax cuts, about $79 billion in fiscal year 2009. George W. Bush was not in office when those measures passed. So a more accurate number for the deficit he passed on might be closer to $1.2 trillion. But Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group concerned by rising deficits, told PunditFact that the budget numbers don’t tell you much. It’s very difficult to untangle responsibility during those years, he said. "In FY2009 you didn’t just have the stimulus," Ellis said. "Many of the fiscal decisions at the end of the Bush presidency were done in consultation with the president-elect, like the Detroit auto bailout. Even with TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program) both campaigns were consulted." Ellis is wary of what he calls snapshot comparisons because he doesn’t think they are fair to either the president stepping down or the one taking over. They ignore too much context. Ellis noted that before deficits plummeted under Obama, they remained quite high. The Occupy Democrats post brushed past that fiscal reality. "The debt has increased more under President Obama so far than it did in the entirety of President Bush’s eight years," Ellis said. "I don’t think that’s an accurate measure either, but it tells a different tale." Sinclair, along with Ellis, emphasized a simple fact of budgeting that should be factored in: the role of Congress. "Since Congress is really responsible for the budget, it's always a little strange to blame the president for it," Sinclair said. And Ellis noted that about two-thirds of all spending is mandatory, in the form of entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare. That said, according to the Congressional Budget Office, policy changes under George W. Bush — including tax cuts, the Iraq War, the Medicare prescription drug benefit and agricultural subsidies — greatly increased deficits. Our ruling Occupy Democrats said that George W. Bush "handed Obama a $1.4 trillion deficit" and Obama reduced Bush’s "deficit to just $492 billion." The post picked certain years to back that up, and for those years, its numbers were accurate. But many factors complicate this simple picture. While it’s true that Bush pushed policies that drove up deficits, the federal response to the Great Recession was to some extent shared by Bush and Obama. In addition, while deficits have fallen under Obama, the claim brushes over that deficits remained above the trillion dollar mark for several years, long after Bush left office. The statement leaves out a lot of important information. We rate it Half True.	None	Occupy Democrats	None	None	None	2015-08-27T12:52:44	2015-04-25	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-02990	Since Obamacare became law, "most of our new jobs have been part-time jobs."	false	/virginia/statements/2013/oct/18/ken-cuccinelli/cuccinelli-says-most-new-jobs-have-been-part-time-/	Republican gubernatorial nominee Ken Cuccinelli says Obamacare has eroded the quality of jobs in the United States. "Since the president signed it into law, in Virginia and around the country, most of our new jobs have been part-time jobs limited to less than 30 hours a week so employers can avoid the high cost of federally imposed health care bills," Cuccinelli said in a Sept. 19 speech. Cuccinelli has sought to make his opposition of Obamacare and Democratic nominee Terry McAuliffe’s support of the law a major issue in the gubernatorial race. Cuccinelli’s statement referred to an Obamacare mandate -- scheduled to take effect in 2015 -- that businesses with more than 50 employees provide health care coverage to those working 30 hours or more a week or pay a fine. Obamacare became law in March 2010. We asked Cuccinelli’s campaign for proof that most of the jobs created since then have been part-time. Anna Nix, a Cuccinelli campaign spokeswoman, pointed us to a Sept. 2, 2013 article in the Richmond Times-Dispatch that said the number of temporary U.S. workers had risen by 2.7 million -- a 50 percent jump -- since the recession ended in June 2009. Those figures, however, don’t verify Cuccinelli’s claim that the majority of new jobs during the last 4-1/2 years have been part time. So we dug deeper. The Bureau of Labor Statistics each month reports the number of people who usually work full time and the number who usually work part time. It defines part-time employees as people who usually work less than 35 hours a week -- an even broader definition of part time than Cuccinelli cited. In March 2010, seasonally adjusted BLS figures show the U.S. had 111.2 million full-time workers. That rose to 116.2 million in August 2013, the latest month for which figures were available when Cuccinelli made his statement. That’s an increase of about 5 million. The number of part-time jobs went from 27.5 million in March 2010 to just under 28 million in August 2013, an increase of about 500,000. So, contrary to Cuccinelli’s claim, full-time jobs have grown 10 times faster than part-time employment since Obamacare was signed into law. Cuccinelli would have been on more solid ground if he had confined his statement to this year. From January through August, there were increases of 290,000 full-time jobs and 532,000 part-time positions. In other words, nearly two out of three new jobs this year have been part time. Many analysts think there’s a connection between Obamacare and the surge in part-time jobs this year, although they also say the sluggish economy has a role in the increase. The employer insurance mandate originally was scheduled to begin next year, causing hundreds of businesses to announce they are hiring only part-time workers or scaling back hours to avoid the cost of providing benefits required by Obamacare. The White House announced in July it would push back the employer mandate to 2015. Researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco wrote in an Aug. 26 memo that the trend of part-time hiring might slacken now that the insurance requirement has been delayed. The Fed researchers wrote that Obamacare’s impact on part-time employment so far and in the future is "likely to be small." About 19 percent of U.S. jobs are now part time. The researchers said once Obamacare is fully implemented, the proportion of part-time jobs is likely to increase by 1 to 2 percent "or less." Mark Perry, a economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, recently cautioned against giving too much meaning to this year’s part-time employment numbers, writing that the data is "extremely volatile" in the short term and needs to be considered over time. A final note: Cuccinelli claimed that since the signing of Obamacare, most of the new jobs have been part time not only across the nation, but in Virginia as well. We spoke to several analysts while trying to research the state numbers. But there’s no set of monthly numbers that shows the increase in full-time and part-time jobs between the signing of the Affordable Care Act and the time when Cuccinelli made his statement. Our ruling Cuccinelli says that since President Barack Obama signed the health care law, most of the new jobs created in the country have been part time. He’s flat out wrong. BLS figures show that since the signing in March 2010, there are 5 million more full-time workers and 500,000 more part-time employees. Cuccinelli would have been on the putting for par if he’d aimed his statement at the first eight months of this year, when 65 percent of new jobs were part time, although analysts differ on Obamacare’s blame for that trend. But his shot at Obamacare since its inception wound up in the woods. We rate his statement False.	None	Ken Cuccinelli	None	None	None	2013-10-18T10:51:26	2013-09-19	['None']
pomt-14590	"I waited until (the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement) had actually been negotiated" before deciding whether to endorse it.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/05/hillary-clinton/hillary-clintons-revisionist-history-tpp/	Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's position on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal became an issue during her Feb. 4 debate with Sen. Bernie Sanders at the University of New Hampshire. She says she now opposes it. MSNBC debate moderator Chuck Todd pointed out that Clinton supported the deal while secretary of state, then asked her whether she might support such agreements again if she were elected. Clinton said she had voted against a previous trade deal as a U.S. senator and, regarding the Trans-Pacific Partnership, "I said that I was holding out the hope that (TPP) would be the kind of trade agreement that I was looking for. "I waited until it had actually been negotiated because I did want to give the benefit of the doubt to the (Obama) administration," she said. "Once I saw what the outcome was, I opposed it." Did Clinton really withhold her support until the terms of the proposal had been finalized? PolitiFact has looked at the issue before. We found Clinton made plenty of strongly supportive comments about the deal while negotiations were still ongoing. Speaking in Australia in 2012, Clinton hailed the deal as "setting the gold standard." "This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field," Clinton said. "And when negotiated, this agreement will cover 40 percent of the world's total trade and build in strong protections for workers and the environment." Strong words for a deal that hadn't been completed yet. But it wasn’t just on that one occasion that Clinton was more than just hopeful about the deal’s impact. She declared in November 2012 remarks in Singapore that it would "lower barriers, raise standards, and drive long-term growth across the region. "It will cover 40 percent of the world's total trade and establish strong protections for workers and the environment. Better jobs with higher wages and safer working conditions, including for women, migrant workers and others too often in the past excluded from the formal economy will help build Asia's middle class and rebalance the global economy." As PolitiFact reported in October, she also used words such as "exciting," "innovative," "ambitious," "groundbreaking," "cutting-edge," "high-quality" and "high-standard" in describing the partnership before she left the State Department in 2013. The partners finalized the deal in 2015. Why the change of heart? In Thursday’s debate, Clinton said she opposes the trade deal because, "We have failed to provide the basic safety net support that American workers need in order to be able to compete and win in the global economy." Our ruling Clinton said, "I waited until (the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement) had actually been negotiated" before deciding whether to endorse it. As secretary of state and a member of the Obama administration, it was Clinton's job to promote the deal, even if it wasn't finalized. Nonetheless, her comments at the time were so positive and so definitive, it becomes disingenuous to argue, as she's doing now, that she didn't endorse the deal before it was finalized.

pomt-05353	Says Democratic recall opponent Tom Barrett is campaigning on "lifting property tax" limits.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/may/11/scott-walker/wisconsin-recall-gov-scott-walker-says-opponent-to/	Reducing property taxes is one accomplishment Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker touts in his bid to remain in office. In April 2012, the Republican governor announced that during his first year in office, the property tax bill for the typical Wisconsin homeowner had gone down -- the first such decrease in 12 years. Meanwhile, as we found in rating a claim by the Republican Governors Association, the Milwaukee property tax levy increased in seven of eight years under Mayor Tom Barrett, Walker’s opponent in the June 2012 recall election. So it was no surprise that Walker would seek an opportunity to hit Barrett on the issue. On May 7, 2012, a day before Barrett won the Democratic recall nomination, Walker released a TV ad claiming -- among other things -- that taxes would go up if Barrett is elected governor. At one point in the ad, the narrator says "Barrett wants to undo (Walker’s) reforms and raise your taxes to pay for it." As those words are spoken, a more specific message appears on the screen: "Barrett campaigns on lifting property tax ceilings." Walker himself repeated the more specific claim the next day on Milwaukee talk radio, telling host Jay Weber of WISN-AM (1130) that both Barrett and Kathleen Falk, who finished second in the primary, "said they’d lift the caps on property taxes." But hardly anybody likes taxes, right? Is Barrett really "campaigning on" raising them? Let’s start with some background. Walker and the Republican-led Legislature adopted strict property tax caps as part of the 2011-2013 state budget. For counties and municipalities, growth in the levy is limited to the value of new construction. Walker and lawmakers also cut school aid and reduced the overall amount of revenue that schools could raise in state aid and property taxes -- known as the revenue limit -- by 5.5 percent. The result? According to the state Department of Revenue, the total property tax levy in the state rose by just $21 million, or 0.2 percent, in 2011. And property taxes on the median home valued at $157,600 fell about $11, or 0.4 percent, to $2,951 -- the first such drop since 1999. But Walker’s ad focuses on Barrett’s position. Walker’s evidence In accusing Barrett of campaigning to lift the caps, the ad cites a news article on the website of WTAQ, an AM and FM radio station in Green Bay. The article was posted April 17, 2012, the day after Walker announced the property tax reduction. The headline on the article -- "Barrett, Falk campaign on lifting property tax ceilings" -- was almost word for word the message that appeared on the screen in Walker’s ad. But the article itself made an important distinction between Barrett and Falk. Both criticized the property tax limits, but while Falk said she would repeal the limits, Barrett "stopped short of making that promise," the article said. When we asked Walker campaign spokeswoman Ciara Matthews to back Walker’s claim, she argued that even if Barrett didn’t promise to remove the caps, he nevertheless had campaigned to do so. Matthews pointed us to another part of the article, which quoted Barrett campaign spokesman Phil Walzak as saying the caps are "absolute and draconian." Matthews also noted that a longer version of Walzak’s comment appeared in a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article the same day the radio station website article was posted. The newspaper, noting that Walzak’s comment was made in a prepared statement, quoted Walzak as saying: "Of course controlling tax increases will be a priority. But Walker's caps are absolute and draconian. They don't account for inflation adjustments, or allow adjustments for real economic growth." That statement shows Barrett is against keeping the current property tax caps in place -- but doesn’t indicate whether Barrett would merely modify the limits or lift them altogether. Matthews didn’t provide any other evidence, and we couldn’t find any other statements Barrett has made in the campaign about property tax caps. Barrett’s response Walzak told us Barrett has not campaigned on lifting the caps, and that the statement he issued criticizing them was in response to a Journal Sentinel reporter’s question. That’s a relevant point, given that Barrett has campaigned repeatedly on a number of issues -- including restoring collective bargaining rights for public employees and "ending the civil war" that he says Walker started. But he hasn’t emphasized property tax caps. Walzak also argued that Walker’s ad wrongly implies Barrett would lift the caps in a way that would lead to widespread property tax increases, leaving no controls. But what Barrett advocates, according to Walzak, is working with local governments to give them flexibility to raise property taxes when more revenue is needed to spur economic growth. Here’s the full statement Walzak issued on the subject: "Unlike the top-down imposition of policy that dictates policy instead of develops it in partnership with local leaders, Tom as governor will work with local governments and officials to determine what they need to make local investments to attract retain and create jobs on the local level. Of course controlling tax increases will be a priority. But Walker's caps are absolute and draconian. They don't account for inflation adjustments, or allow adjustments for real economic growth. These inflexible, rigid caps can actually stifle opportunities for local growth, because they can have a negative impact in investing in business parks and transportation infrastructure that are so often key to making investments that encourage business expansion or make local areas more attractive to businesses considering relocation from other states." The complete statement makes it clear that Barrett wants to change the current property tax caps. But the fact that no other Barrett statements on the caps could be found indicates he has not been campaigning on the issue. And he has not articulated to what degree he would change the caps. Our rating In a TV ad, Walker claimed that Barrett is campaigning "on lifting property tax ceilings." It was part of a more sweeping claim that taxes overall would go up with Barrett as governor. Barrett issued a statement during the campaign making it clear he wants to change the caps, so in that sense he would "lift" them. But he has not campaigned on the issue, nor spelled out how much he would modify the current limits. Walker’s claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression -- our definition of Mostly False.

pomt-08003	"A record number of Hispanics were elected to the U.S House of Representatives..."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/jan/13/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-record-number-hispanics-elected-us-h/	The 2010 midterm elections saw the rise of the Tea Party, the resurgence of the Republican Party in Congress, and a number of Hispanic candidates elected to prominent positions. There was Marco Rubio, a Cuban-American elected to the United States Senate; Brian Sandoval, the first Hispanic governor of Nevada; and Susana Martinez of New Mexico, the first Hispanic woman in the country to be elected as governor. The successes of Hispanic candidates in the midterm elections is a point noted by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush in an opinion article he penned for The Miami Herald on Jan. 9, 2011. In the article, Bush, a Republican, warns that conservatives "get unacceptably low support among Hispanic voters nationally" and urges the "center-right movement … to engage the Hispanic community." "The unprecedented success of Hispanic center-right candidates in this past election is a clear sign that now is the time to recommit to a serious outreach effort," Bush writes. "Among these newly-elected Hispanic leaders, there were many notable records and firsts. Marco Rubio was overwhelmingly elected to the U.S. Senate despite starting his campaign as a heavy underdog to more-seasoned candidates. A record number of Hispanics were elected to the U.S House of Representatives, including Republicans Raúl Labrador of Idaho, David Rivera of Florida, Bill Flores and Francisco Canseco from Texas, and Jaime Herrera of Washington." He wrote the piece in advance of the Hispanic Leadership Network Conference, which he helped organize. The conference, scheduled for Jan. 13 and 14, 2011, in Coral Gables, is aimed at engaging "members of the Hispanic community on center-right principles." We decided to check the accuracy of Bush’s claim that a record number of Hispanics had been elected to the U.S. House this past election. First, we turned to Bush for clarification. His press secretary, Jaryn Emhoff, said Bush's references to "center-right" was intended to refer to Hispanic Republicans. "An earlier sentence sets the stage when it says, ‘The unprecedented success of Hispanic center-right candidates…’," Emhoff explained. To check the validity of Bush’s claim, we turned to the National Association of Latino Elected Officials (NALEO), which keeps track of the progress made by Hispanic-Latino candidates from the local to the national level. "There was a record number of Hispanic Republicans elected, but not a record number of Hispanics in general," said Patricia Guadalupe, spokesperson for the NALEO Educational Fund. "There were two Latinos who lost their seats to non-Latinos, and in other seats you had one Latino replacing another," Guadalupe said. There are currently 24 Hispanic members of the U.S. House, which matches the record set in 2009 by the incoming class of the 111th Congress. However, the most notable shift between the two classes is the gain made by Republicans. In 2009, there were 21 Democrats and three Republicans; now, those figures now stand at 17 Democrats and seven Republicans. During the November 2010 elections, the seven Hispanic Republicans elected to the U.S House were: • Bill Flores, Texas -- Flores, a political newcomer was able to defeat longtime Rep. Chet Edwards, a Democrat. Flores’ win made him the first Republican Latino to represent Texas’s 17th congressional district. • Francisco Canseco, Texas -- Canseco, a businessman, defeated Democratic Rep. Ciro Rodriguez, (also Hispanic), for the state’s District 23 congressional seat. • Jaime Herrera, Washington -- Herrera became the first Hispanic to represent the state in Congress by defeating businessman Danny Heck. • Raul Labrador, Idaho -- By defeating Democratic incumbent Walter Minnick, Labrador became the state’s first Latino congressman. • David Rivera, Florida -- Rivera won against Democratic challenger Joe Garcia for the Florida District 25 seat vacated by Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart. • Mario Diaz-Balart, Florida -- Already a congressman representing District 25, Diaz-Balart opted to run for the District 21 seat being vacated by his brother, Lincoln Diaz-Balart. • Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Florida -- The country’s first Hispanic woman elected to Congress retained her seat in a heavily Hispanic and Republican district after running against a lesser-known Democratic candidate, Rolando A. Banciella. For a complete list of all the Hispanic members of the House elected in 2010, click here. The number of Hispanics in Congress has been rising steadily. Consider that in 1998, there were 18 Hispanic members in the House and no senators. Fast forward to 2011: There are 24 Hispanics in the House and two Cuban-American senators, Rubio and Sen. Bob Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey. Although the number of Hispanics in the House is the same now as it was after the 2008 election, Bush is correct in recognizing the growth in the past decade. However, he would have been more precise if he’d said that a record number of Hispanic Republicans were elected to the U.S. House, rather than leaving it to the reader’s assumption that he was referring to the GOP. We rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Jeb Bush	None	None	None	2011-01-13T18:22:52	2011-01-09	['None']
pomt-10801	"I have not changed my position on the (gay) marriage amendment or anything else related to marriage."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/05/mitt-romney/consistent-on-gay-marriage-not-on-amendment/	In a Sept. 14, 2007 interview on MSNBC, Romney said, "I have not changed my position on the marriage amendment or anything else related to marriage that ...you know, I think the New York Times said that I had changed my tone." Here's a look at his comments over the years: In 1994, as a candidate for the U.S. Senate, he told a Boston-area gay newspaper that the definition of marriage was a "state issue as you know -- the authorization of marriage on a same-sex basis falls under state jurisdiction." During his Senate race, Romney wrote in a letter to the Massachusetts branch of the Log Cabin Republicans, "I am more convinced than ever before that as we seek to establish full equality for America's gay and lesbian citizens, I will provide more effective leadership than my opponent." He promised the group that he would support laws preventing discrimination against gays and lesbians in the workplace and implied his hope for the eventual full integration of gays in the military. But even in 1994, he clearly opposed legalizing same-sex marriage, telling the Bay Windows newspaper that he backed the current governor's position that the law should only uphold male-female marriages. In 2002, when Romney was governor, his wife, son and daughter-in-law signed a petition supporting a proposed amendment to the Massachusetts constitution, that would not only ban the state from recognizing same-sex marriages, but further stated, "Any other relationship shall not be recognized as a marriage or its legal equivalent, nor shall it receive the benefits or incidents exclusive to marriage." But Romney quickly expressed his opposition to the amendment, saying that although he believed marriage was between a man and a woman, the language barring civil unions was "too extreme," with his spokesman telling the Boston Globe, "Mitt does not support it. As far as Mitt is concerned, it goes farther than current law, and therefore it's unnecessary." Yet in 2003, when the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled that same-sex couples could be married in the state, Romney urged the legislature to adopt a constitutional amendment banning the practice. He has since supported a similar amendment to the U.S. Constitution, despite the fact that the congressionally proposed constitutional amendment includes language similar to the 2002 Massachusetts ballot proposal that he opposed. And so we give Romney a Half-True. He is correct that he has been consistent in his opposition to same-sex marriage, but has changed his position as to the scope of an amendment that he would support.

pomt-11027	"Tim Kaine doesn’t want a border at all. He wants to get rid of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and basically the border patrol as well."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/03/corey-stewart/corey-stewart-falsely-claims-sen-tim-kaine-wants-d/	Corey Stewart, the Republican vying to unseat incumbent Sen. Tim Kaine in Virginia, blasted Kaine and other Democrats for their immigration views during a live video broadcast to his Facebook page on June 30, 2018. "The left is calling for — Tim Kaine and the Democrats are calling for — not only no border enforcement; they don’t want a border at all," Stewart said. "Tim Kaine doesn’t want a border at all. He wants to get rid of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and basically the border patrol as well. He wants to get rid of all that." The video showed Stewart driving in his car to a protest at the Red Hen, the restaurant in Lexington, Va., that sparked controversy when its owner asked White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders to get up from her table and leave. Stewart was joined at the protest by campaign supporters, including a local "Bikers for Trump" group. His comments followed some Democratic calls to abolish ICE, the U.S. government agency best known for arresting, detaining and deporting undocumented immigrants. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com After progressive candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defeated Rep. Joe Crowley, D-N.Y., with a campaign that called for ICE’s elimination, several Democratic leaders — including Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand and Elizabeth Warren — adopted similar positions. But we found no evidence that Kaine hopped on that bandwagon, despite Stewart’s claim. Noel Fritsch, spokesman for the Stewart campaign, did not respond to a request for comment. Kaine has been relatively firm in his support for bills that add to border security, while at the same time advocating for legal immigration, protection of Dreamers — immigrants here illegally who arrived as children — and other traditionally Democratic immigration policies. Kaine has also been critical of Trump’s policy of separating immigrant families at the border. With regard to ICE, Kaine has rebuked controversial raiding tactics practiced under the Trump administration, but he has not called for the agency’s termination. "Tim believes we need comprehensive immigration reform and strongly supported legislation that passed the Senate in 2013 to create a path to citizenship and fund border security," said a statement on the immigration page of Kaine’s campaign website. The 2013 bill, for which Kaine delivered a Senate floor speech in Spanish, was the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, and it passed the Senate by a 68-32 vote. Although it ultimately died in the House, the bill would have increased the number of federal agents along the U.S. border with Mexico, required construction of 700 miles of border fencing and allocated money for aerial drones, among other border security measures. The bill also included provisions that would have allowed immigrants living in the U.S. illegally to adjust their immigration status so long as they satisfied certain criteria. Later, in February 2018, Kaine co-sponsored a bipartisan bill to protect Dreamers and enhance border security. In addition to providing legal status and a path to citizenship for people who arrived in the U.S. as children, the bill would have granted $25 billion in funding for Northern and Southern border security over a 10-year period. "We’ve reached a deal that gives us the best chance to protect Dreamers against deportation from the only country they know as home," Kaine said at the time. Ultimately, the proposal fell short of the 60 votes needed to pass the Senate after the Trump administration publicly opposed it. "I think we do need to do more border control," Kaine said during an interview on MSNBC’s "Morning Joe" in April 2018. "I want to see a strategy … not just a president acting like the military was his palace guard and he could do whatever he wanted on a day in question." Ian Sams, communications director for the Kaine campaign, pointed to the 2013 and 2018 bills as well as an op-ed Kaine wrote criticizing the Trump policy of separating families at the border. Sams also noted that the $25 billion in border security funds provided by the 2018 proposal was the exact amount Trump had requested. Our Ruling Stewart said, "Tim Kaine doesn’t want a border at all. He wants to get rid of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and basically the border patrol as well." We found no evidence to support this claim. On the contrary, Kaine has backed two comprehensive immigration bills that featured significant measures for increased border security. He has not made any statements about getting rid of ICE, let alone the border. We rate Stewart’s statement Pants on Fire!

pomt-01644	The Obama administration originally "wanted 10,000 troops to remain in Iraq -- not combat troops, but military advisers, special operations forces, to watch the counterterrorism effort."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/aug/24/martha-raddatz/obama-wanted-keep-10000-troops-iraq-abcs-raddatz-c/	Sunday show pundits weighed provocations by the Islamic State this week after the public beheading of American journalist James Foley, with some military analysts arguing for a stronger military response from President Barack Obama. On ABC This Week, retired Marine Gen. John Allen said ending the threat from the Islamic State will require a coalition approach that targets the extreme militant groups across the larger region of Iraq and Syria. Martha Raddatz, ABC’s chief global affairs correspondent, was wearing her TV pundit hat when she said Allen’s idea for a strategy "makes me think back about what the Obama administration originally wanted." "They wanted 10,000 troops to remain in Iraq -- not combat troops, but military advisers, special operations forces, to watch the counterterrorism effort," she said. "So perhaps they'd go that way, but it would be a tough one." The number sounded interesting to PunditFact given Obama’s 2008 campaign pledge to pull out of Iraq entirely (which PolitiFact monitors here) and his repeated 2012 campaign proclamations that the war was over. So we decided to check it out. The plan Shortly before Obama took office in January 2009, his predecessor, George W. Bush, finalized an important agreement after about a year of negotiations with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. Called the Status of Forces Agreement, it spelled out the withdrawal of all American troops by the end of 2011. Obama, who won office in 2008 partly for his pledge to end the war in Iraq, announced his own draw-down plans a month after taking office. "Let me say this as plainly as I can: by Aug. 31, 2010, our combat mission in Iraq will end," he said Feb. 27, 2009. His speech revealed more details: He would keep between 35,000 to 50,000 military personnel there through the end of 2011 to train and advise Iraqi military and for counterterrorism purposes. What would happen after Jan. 1, 2012, -- a central point in our fact-check -- was not settled until the fall of 2011. Obama and the Iraqi government had been open to leaving more troops behind to help the country remain stable. But it didn’t happen. The result On Oct. 21, 2011, Obama announced the pullout of the vast majority of American troops in Iraq by Christmas. Staying behind were a couple hundred Marines to train the Iraqi army and provide security for diplomatic personnel. Essentially, he implemented the phase-out plan laid out by Bush. Facing a re-election challenge, Obama held the drawdown of all troops as the fulfillment of a campaign pledge. He did not harp on what some, namely Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, would see as a failure: failure to reach an agreement regarding how many American troops would remain in the country beyond Jan. 1, 2012. This was something Obama and his defense advisers had pushed for as they wrangled in negotiations with the al-Maliki-led government in the summer of 2011. The administration feared a virtually complete pullout would allow for big attacks from militant groups. Here’s what they wanted, and why it failed. Behind the numbers Military commanders in Washington and in Baghdad pushed for a residual force between 16,000 and 24,000 to conduct counterrorism work and train Iraqi security forces. The White House, reports show, was not open to a force that size. The Obama administration was initially open to leaving up to 10,000 troops in Iraq after the scheduled pullout at the end of 2011, a controversial pitch that would have required approval from Iraq’s divided government to change the 2008 agreement, the Los Angeles Times reported. The troops were to be placed in Baghdad and other "strategic" locations around the country. It did not stay there. The New York Times detailed how the one-time goal of a 10,000-person force shrank before negotiations failed altogether. Obama ruled out the 10,000-troop option in an Aug. 13, 2011, conference call, according to the New York Times, and "the new goal would be a continuous presence of about 3,500 troops, a rotating force of up to 1,500 and half a dozen F-16’s." What killed the deal The agreement failed over a demand that American troops be given immunity from prosecution by Iraqis, a very touchy political issue within the Iraqi Parliament. Some experts said Iraqi leaders may not have been willing to take great political risk with their citizens in exchange for a relatively small American force. But no immunity meant no sizable residual troop presence. "When the Americans asked for immunity, the Iraqi side answered that it was not possible," al-Maliki said in an October 2011 news conference. "The discussions over the number of trainers and the place of training stopped. Now that the issue of immunity was decided and that no immunity to be given, the withdrawal has started." Three years later, as the Islamic State advanced in the country and shocked the world, a CNN reporter asked Obama if he regretted the decision not to leave a residual force in Iraq. Obama said, "Keep in mind, that wasn't a decision made by me. That was a decision made by the Iraqi government." The political overtones have ratcheted up with international headlines about Islamic State, which also is called ISIS. Conservatives blame Obama for pulling out too soon, for leaving Iraq vulnerable, and liberals argue the pullout deadline was prescribed by Bush. "You pick your poison there," said Lance Janda, chairman of Cameron University’s Department of History and Government. "It’s fair to say no one saw this ISIS stuff coming." An ABC spokesman said Raddatz was unavailable for comment. The White House did not respond to emails. Our ruling Raddatz said the Obama administration originally "wanted 10,000 troops to remain in Iraq -- not combat troops, but military advisers, special operations forces, to watch the counterterrorism effort." For a period, at least, the Obama administration did envision leaving 10,000 troops in Iraq past the Dec. 31, 2011, pullout of forces. That number went down to about 5,000 before negotiations stalled amid a legal snare over immunity of American forces in Iraqi courts. Her claim is accurate but needs additional information.

pomt-13835	Says "220,000 New Yorkers would have immediately benefitted had President Obama’s executive action been affirmed. So almost a quarter million of our fellow New Yorkers who are hurting right now whose rights and opportunities were taken away by the Supreme Court."	mostly false	/new-york/statements/2016/jul/13/bill-de-blasio/less-immigrants-affects-supreme-court-ruling-nyc-d/	After the U.S. Supreme Court struck down parts of President Barack Obama’s 2014 executive actions on immigration reform, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio held an impromptu press conference at New York City Hall. During his remarks, he offered an estimate of the number of unauthorized immigrants in New York City who would be affected by the court’s ruling. "Two hundred twenty-thousand New Yorkers would have immediately benefitted had President Obama’s executive action been affirmed," De Blasio said. "So almost a quarter million of our fellow New Yorkers who are hurting right now whose rights and opportunities were taken away by the Supreme Court." De Blasio claimed that the Supreme Court’s ruling would damage the lives of 220,000 people in New York City. So did the Supreme Court ruling mean that many people lost their chance to legally remain in the country? DAPA and DACA Checking the accuracy of the mayor’s assertion requires accounting for the number of people affected by three actions by the Obama administration. First, the administration started the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA, in 2012. DACA allows people who came to the United States before their 16th birthday to legally remain in the country for at least two years. After the two years, they can apply for renewal. To qualify for the program, immigrants could not be older than 31 in 2012. Immigrants also had to have a relatively clean criminal record and be on track to finish high school or already graduated. The Migration Policy Institute estimated 53,000 people in New York City eligible to legally remain in the country under the 2012 DACA program, slightly more than an estimate of 48,935 by the Center for Migration Studies Second, in 2014, Obama expanded the DACA program. The age limit was lifted under the expansion. Some 15,701 people were eligible for the 2014 DACA extension, according to the Center for Migration Studies. Third, Obama also created the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans program, or DAPA, in 2014. The new program allowed parents of U.S. citizens to legally stay in the country for at least three years, after which they would be eligible for renewal. The center said its research shows an estimated 143,064 immigrants eligible for DAPA in New York City. According to the Migration Policy Institute, there are 627,000 unauthorized immigrants living in the five counties that make up New York City. Of those, 230,000 would have been eligible to legally remain in the country under either DAPA or DACA following the president’s 2014 actions, according to the institute. In 2014, many Republicans criticized DACA but weren’t able to reverse Obama’s action. But the expansion of DACA and creation of DAPA led to a legal storm between the state of Texas and the Obama administration. Texas argued that the president’s 2014 actions violated the Constitution. The Supreme Court sided with Texas. The decision struck down DAPA and the 2014 DACA expansion but left the original DACA program in place. So how many would be affected in New York City? When counting the number of people affected by the Supreme Court ruling, those eligible to legally remain in the country only because of the DAPA program or the 2014 expansion of DACA should be counted. That comes to just under 160,000 affected people, according to the Center for Migration Studies. The Migration Policy Institute pegs it slightly higher at 180,000 immigrants. Those who were eligible for the original 2012 DACA program are still eligible to apply and be granted deferred action despite the court ruling. A few groups track the number of people who were eligible under the 2014 actions, including the Migration Policy Institute. It is one of the few that have data available specifically for counties with high populations of unauthorized immigrants. That’s important because Mayor de Blasio was only referring to numbers in New York City. Its data is the latest from the U.S. Census Bureau. The mayor’s office says it also used data from the bureau to come up with its number. The bureau does not directly ask people if they are authorized to live in the U.S. legally. Michelle Mittelstadt from the Migration Policy Institute says the institute considers the population and demographics of an area to come up with a final number, and it’s among the few that does so on a local level. "The Census Bureau does not ask people their legal status with respect to being unauthorized," Mittelstadt said. "That leaves it to a small number of organizations who have developed methodology to essentially try to look at who among the foreign-born population is unauthorized." Our ruling At a press conference on June 23, Mayor de Blasio said, "Two hundred twenty thousand New Yorkers would have immediately benefitted had President Obama’s executive action been affirmed. So almost a quarter million of our fellow New Yorkers who are hurting right now whose rights and opportunities were taken away by the Supreme Court." Based on the latest data, released in 2014, the mayor overestimated the number of unauthorized immigrants the Supreme Court ruling affected.

pomt-15316	"Christian Pastor in Vermont Sentenced to One Year in Prison After Refusing to Marry Gay Couple"	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/16/blog-posting/did-vermont-pastor-get-sentenced-prison-refusing-m/	Perhaps you have seen in your social media feeds an article headlined, "Christian Pastor in Vermont Sentenced to One Year in Prison After Refusing to Marry Gay Couple." It received about 5,000 Facebook shares as well as interactions on other social media platforms. Is it real? We decided to take a closer look. The article was published at a site called NewsExaminer on July 10. It says that a pastor from Proctor, Vt., was sentenced to a year in federal prison after refusing to marry gay couples. It came just days after the Supreme Court ruled, 5-4, that same-sex marriage would be allowed in all 50 states. (The ruling didn’t legalize same-sex marriage in Vermont, which approved it on its own in 2009.) But the bottom line is that the NewsExaminer is a fake-news site, and has been classified as such by Snopes, the urban legends site. Through a posting to an NBC copycat website with the url www.nbc.com.co, the article gained traction through mistaken association with the genuine NBC News site. The article cites several individuals involved in the case, but none seem to exist. The Christian pastor who was sentenced, Paul Horner, is actually a recurring name used in stories published by the National Report and other fake news sites. According to Snopes.com, the character Paul Horner has been used in past articles about everything from the British street artist Banksy to a Dolphin mascot for a Christian organization. (We’ve previously run into the Zelig-like Horner in such articles as this one and this one.) The Hon. Myron Danus, the judge who supposedly made the ruling, is also fictitious. We checked the Vermont Court Administration Office in Montpelier, the U.S. District Court in Rutland County, and the Rutland County District Court to check if there is any judge by that name in the state, and there isn’t. Though the LGBT Pride Center referenced in the article is real -- or at least there is an organization with a similar name -- Gwen Hawkins, the supposed president of the organization, does not exist. Instead, the Pride Center of Vermont lists Kim Fountain as its executive director. We also couldn’t find a record for the Vermont Family Research Committee or its purported president, Steve Shand. There is one element of the article that is accurate: The town of Proctor exists. It is a small town in Rutland County, Vt.,with a population of just under 2,000. It is, as the article accurately says, "home to the Vermont Marble Museum, and the only marble bridge in America." However, the Christian Proctor Church is as fake as its pastor. According to the Proctor Town Offices, the town has only three churches: St. Dominic’s, Union, and St. Paul’s. Our ruling Posts about a Christian pastor in Vermont being sentenced to one year in prison after refusing to marry a gay couple have circulated on the Internet. However, the article was published at a known fake-news site, and we found no evidence to support the existence of key elements of the story, including the pastor, church, or the judge referenced in the article. We rate this claim Pants On Fire.	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2015-07-16T16:58:10	2015-07-10	['None']
pomt-14472	"There is not a single candidate in the Republican primary that thinks we should do anything about climate change."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/01/barack-obama/obama-none-gop-candidates-have-climate-change-plan/	Foreign leaders are "troubled" by some of the rhetoric coming out of the Republican presidential primary, and it’s not just what they’re hearing from Donald Trump, says President Barack Obama. "But this is not just Mr. Trump. Look at the statements that are being made by the other candidates," Obama said at a Feb. 16 news conference. "There is not a single candidate in the Republican primary that thinks we should do anything about climate change, that thinks it’s serious. Well, that's a problem. The rest of the world looks at that and says, how can that be?" Obama’s statement sounded similar to a take from Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, who recently said, "Not one Republican has the guts to recognize that climate change is real." We rated that claim False because a couple GOP presidential candidates (including some who are no longer in the running) have acknowledged its existence. Obama’s claim is different: He said none of the Republicans thinks the country should do anything about climate change. To different degrees, the remaining candidates don’t believe man-made climate change is happening, or at least not to the extent that Obama and a vast majority of climate scientists believe it’s happening. All of the Republican candidates — Donald Trump, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, John Kasich and Ben Carson — call for scaling back environmental and energy regulations. Some support going through the private sector for renewable energy source development, alongside continued development of fossil fuels, and environmental protection. But none have a fleshed-out plan to specifically address the issue of climate change. Here’s where the remaining Republican presidential candidates stand on climate change and what they propose to do (or not do) about it. Donald Trump Trump has said repeatedly that he does not believe in climate change, even suggesting it’s a conspiracy invented by China to make the United States less competitive. His website doesn’t have any information on his plans to combat climate change or how he would approach energy issues. He has said he would abolish the Environmental Protection Agency, and the environment will be "fine." When MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough asked Trump in November what he would do about climate change, Trump did not outline a specific plan, but he said, "We want to have clean air to breathe and we want to have beautiful clean water. That's very important to me." Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. Rubio believes the climate is changing, but he questions how much of it is man-made. "The climate has always changed," Rubio said in January. "There’s never been a time when the climate has not been changing." He has criticized international climate efforts, as well as Obama’s regulatory measures, saying they are more damaging to the economy than they are helpful to the environment. "If you’re overly dependent on any one source of fuel, then you become vulnerable to disruption," he said at the same event in January. "I want America to truly have a truly all-of-the-above strategy." Rubio has not released a plan to quell the effects of climate change. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas Cruz believes man-made climate change is not real. He has called it a "pseudoscientific theory" and has criticized Obama for calling it a major security threat. His website says he would abolish the Energy Department and eliminate at least 10 existing climate change and environmental programs. Like Rubio, he calls for an "all-of-the-above" approach to energy, meaning he supports development of fossil fuels as well as renewable resources, which he says amounts to an "energy renaissance." "We must harness our nation’s energy resources and remove federal impediments to energy exploration, development and trade," he wrote. Ben Carson Carson does not believe in man-made climate change. He has said it’s part of a natural cycle and cannot be "an excuse not to develop our own God-given natural resources." His energy plan calls for reducing government regulations on energy production, including fossil fuels that contribute to climate change, but also developing renewable fuels. He also calls on people to be stewards of the environment, but not at the expense of jobs and the economy. He did tell Time in October 2015 that if there is "clear-cut evidence" that a certain manufacturing practice is causing significant harm to the environment, President Carson might take some action. "I would use the EPA to work with business industry and academia to find the cleanest, most environmentally friendly way to do things, rather than just all right, we’re coming in here and we’re shutting you down," he said. Ohio Gov. John Kasich As recently as Feb. 29, Kasich has said he believes there is a climate change problem, acknowledging he is going against the grain of his party. But he has not proposed a full-fledged strategy to address it, and his fact sheet on energy does not mention climate change. He has, though called for pursuing renewable energy sources as one possible response. In August, he questioned the extent of man’s impact on the environment, calling full-blown climate change "some theory that is not proven." He said he wouldn’t want to destroy any jobs in order to address these concerns. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush Bush has dropped out of the race, but we’re including him because he was still in the running when Obama made his statement. He believes climate change is real and human activity is a contributing factor. He had an energy plan but not a specific environmental protection plan. He has argued that some of the Obama administration’s regulations go too far, such as Obama’s Clean Power Plan. Like most of the other Republican candidates, he called for reducing regulations and increasing growth in the energy sector, both fossil fuel and renewable sources. "Energy resources must be developed in a way that protects human health and the environment," his energy plan said. "Rules play an important role in making sure this is the case. But the Obama administration’s excessive rules too often usurp state and tribal authority and go beyond what is necessary." Our ruling Obama said, "There is not a single candidate in the Republican primary that thinks we should do anything about climate change." None of the remaining Republican presidential candidates have laid out a specific plan to address climate change. All of them call for scaling back Obama’s environmental regulations, to boot. Some have called for private-sector development of renewable energy sources. Bush, who was in the race when Obama made his comment, and Kasich both have said they believe human-caused climate change is real and have said pursuing these alternative energy sources could mitigate the problem. But neither has outlined a specific plan. For some Republican voters, this stance might be a plus. But it doesn’t change the veracity of Obama’s statement. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-07175	"When I became president and CEO of Godfather’s Pizza, it was supposed to go bankrupt . . . We turned it around with common-sense business principles."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/10/herman-cain/herman-cain-godfathers-pizza-turn-around/	Editor's note: This fact-check is a excerpt of a longer examination of Herman Cain's business accomplishments, including his work experience before and after Godfather's Pizza. Read the longer story here. Pizza is Herman Cain's biggest selling point. He says his track record running Godfather’s Pizza, a chain that once billed itself as "the cure for the pizza emergency," shows he has the ability to run the country. The 620-store chain was on the brink of bankruptcy when he arrived in 1986, he says, and he "turned it around with common-sense business principles." A PolitiFact examination of Godfather’s, based on interviews with industry analysts and company officials, shows Cain is largely correct. The chain wasn’t literally preparing paperwork for bankruptcy, but it was widely considered troubled. Cain changed that by uniting the franchisees, overhauling the chain's advertising, and getting his team focused on its core mission: pizza. 'They got what they paid for' Cain was an executive with The Pillsbury Co. when the company bought Godfather's in 1985. The purchase was almost incidental, according to press reports from the time. Godfather’s was part of Diversifoods Inc., a conglomerate that included more than 300 Burger King franchises. Pillsbury wanted the Burger Kings, and the chain of more than 800 Godfather’s pizza restaurants came with it. "The value of Diversifoods was its ownership of the Burger Kings, and the deal made sense without Godfather's," John McMillin, an industry analyst, told the Chicago Tribune shortly after the deal. "Pillsbury got Godfather's for nothing, and some said they got what they paid for." The chain’s problems included franchisee lawsuits, an overly long menu and a dejected workforce. Even its TV ads seemed hapless, showing a car full of executives driving around, unable to find a Godfather's. ("Find one. It's worth it," the ad lamely concluded.) As Cain said later, the chain had "had one foot in the grave and the other on a banana peel." Cain attacked problems on every front. He declared the company’s advertising account up for review, pitting ad agencies against each other in a bidding war. He trimmed the menu and enforced quality standards. He pushed more restaurants to offer delivery, and he closed low-performing franchises. He emphasized communication, giving speeches at important moments to employees and franchisees. After his first 60 days at Godfather's, he gave a speech he called "get on the wagon," which he now uses in political speeches. When he was a boy, Cain said, his grandfather, a potato farmer, would hitch up his mules for the weekly trip to town. Any grandchildren who wanted to go could ride along. Cain would finish the story in his grandfather’s thundering voice: "Them that’s going, get on the wagon! Them that ain’t, get out of the way!" 'Mesmerizing' Charles Henderson, who runs coffee kiosks in Pennsylvania, was Cain’s director of marketing back then. He says Cain is "probably the most inspirational person I’ve ever met in my life." "He can be mesmerizing. He’s very dynamic. I’m not slamming our current president, but Herman Cain will give a 20- or 30-minute speech extemporaneously, and certainly without teleprompters. He is without a doubt the most dynamic speaker I’ve ever heard," Henderson said. Henderson said Cain succeeded because he immersed himself in all aspects of the business and wasn’t afraid to get his hands into the dough. Cain baked pies on a weekly basis after he arrived in Omaha. "He loved to make pizzas. We had a test store over on Pacific Street, which wasn’t too far from Godfather’s, and once a week, he’d round us all up and we’d go make pizzas," Henderson said. Cain directed an overhaul of the Godfather's television ads that focused on Godfather's "hot slice," a customized pizza slice aimed at the lunch crowd and intended to compete with Pizza Hut's Personal Pan Pizza. The new ads showed a secretary at a desk about to have a "pizza emergency." Godfather's, of course, was the cure. Later commercials tended toward attention-getting and even bizarre humor. The "Studney twins" – an old white guy and a young black guy in garish blue and green tuxedos – promoted Godfather's two-for-one specials. Another ad featured attorney-turned-actor Ben Stein of Ferris Bueller's Day Off as a burned-out hipster needing pizza. Cain himself even appeared in a series that Advertising Age named one of the best campaigns of 1989. In one ad, Cain told viewers Godfather's has conducted exhaustive research to find out why customers preferred Godfather's pizza. He introduced his director of research, who unveiled the results by unfolding a piece of paper and reading two words: "More topping." "Enjoy your Godfather's pizza, and take life one bite at a time," Cain concluded. 'Steady the course' Jeff Campbell is the retired Pillsbury executive who selected Cain to run Godfather’s. Reached by PolitiFact at his home in San Diego, he said there was no doubt in his mind that Cain turned Godfather's around. "He was the best thing that happened to Godfather’s in a long time," Campbell said. Cain has said that the chain returned to profitability within 14 months of his arrival. That number wasn’t possible for PolitiFact to independently confirm because the chain did not report its profits as a stand-alone unit, but industry analysts do not dispute that Cain stabilized the company. Technomic, a research and consulting firm focused on the restaurant industry, has research data on Godfather’s going back to the 1970s. At PolitiFact’s request, vice president Darren Tristano examined the revenues and franchise numbers for Godfather’s during the time Cain headed it from 1986 to 1995. It's not possible to determine profitability from those numbers, but they do show Godfather's place in the market, particularly in comparison with its competitors. "It’s really hard from that period to find a strong positive or a strong negative. It’s more like ‘steady the course,’ " Tristano said. Still, "steady the course" isn’t bad for a company that was troubled to start out with and in an industry that’s punishingly competitive, analysts said. Godfather’s position was particularly perilous. It wasn’t as big as chains like Pizza Hut and Domino’s, and it also had to compete with locally owned mom-and-pops in just about every market. "They had to be very innovative to compete with the big three and with the little guys. They couldn’t rest on their laurels," said John Correll, a Michigan-based pizza industry consultant. "For a number of years, Herman Cain and his management team were able to pull that off." Pizza Hut, the industry leader at the time, was a particularly difficult foe. After Godfather's launched its "pizza emergency" campaign in 1986, Pizza Hut matched it with ads imitating the emergency broadcast system. In the event of a real pizza emergency, "you should go directly to Pizza Hut and order their famous pan pizza," the ad said. Pizza Hut executives said the similarity was coincidence. Cain said the alleged thievery wouldn’t matter in the end, and he wouldn’t pursue legal action. "It's not a big deal to us," Cain told AdWeek, which documented the feud. Godfather’s never grew fast enough to outpace giants like Pizza Hut and Domino’s, but today it still claims about 620 franchises across the country. John Chisholm was a Godfather's franchisee who owned 90 restaurants in five states when Cain arrived to run the company. "His leadership and his ability to deal with people were just outstanding. I have nothing but the highest praise for Herman Cain," Chisholm said. Cain's primary accomplishment was motivating the people who worked for Godfather's, Chisolm said. The turn-around happened "mostly through motivation and talking to people and getting people to work as a team." Chisholm recalled Cain's first speech to the entire company as one of the "most charismatic" he ever heard. Cain included a copy of the speech in his 1999 book, Speak as a Leader. "Sixty days ago I came to Godfather's with a curiosity about what I would find. I had already accepted my newly bestowed responsibilities even before I stepped foot on Nebraska soil and before I met or knew anyone or anything about Godfather's. … Sixty days ago, I came to Godfather's anxious to tackle a situation considered by some of our external constituencies to be irreversible. I came without a golden parachute because I never entertained the idea that the situation was irreversible. I came committed to prove the skeptics wrong because I have a personal, fundamental belief in the power of human determination. I came to Godfather's believing in you even before I met you. I challenge you to commit and believe in yourself and Godfather's pizza as a system." Two years after Cain was named chief executive officer, Pillsbury decided to get out of the pizza business and sell Godfather’s. Cain and his management team decided to buy the chain in a leveraged buyout for an undisclosed sum. Cain left the position in 1996 when he went to work for the National Restaurant Association. Cain now says of his time at the pizza chain, "When I became president and CEO of Godfather’s Pizza, it was supposed to go bankrupt . . . We turned it around with common sense business principles." Our ruling A thorough review of business records and interviews with executives who worked with Cain show that the chain was widely considered troubled when he arrived. It's a slight exaggeration to say it was supposed to go bankrupt. But from all accounts, Cain's performance as CEO is widely considered a success. So we rate this statement Mostly True.

pomt-11613	Says Texas schools are ranked "43rd in the nation."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2018/jan/25/andrew-white/andrew-white-texas-ranks-43rd-nation-schools-not-s/	Andrew White, the Houston investor among Democratic aspirants hoping to deny Greg Abbott a second term as governor, says the state’s public schools rank poorly. White specified at his December 2017 campaign kickoff: "For schools, we’re 43rd in the nation. Let me say that again. We’re 43rd in the nation. How can we claim that we’re preparing our kids for tomorrow when we can barely prepare them for yesterday?" It’s not unusual for a candidate to suggest schools need a lift. For instance, Abbott, a Republican, promised on his way to winning the state’s top elected post to make Texas "No. 1 in the nation for educating our children." It’s also worth noting there are varied ways of comparing schools. For instance, US News rankings, drawing in part on student scores on national math and reading exams, place Texas’ public schools 41st--though the state's high school graduation rate ranked fifth. So White, who continued to cite the state’s No. 43 ranking into 2018, made us wonder. White spokeswoman Desi Canela, asked how White reached the declared ranking, pointed out news accounts quoting a study released toward the end of 2015 by Education Week, a national publication that reports on education from kindergarten through high school. The stories, posted in January 2016 by Houston Public Media, the San Antonio Express-News and the El Paso Times, each headlined the No. 43 ranking bestowed based on dozens of indicators across the categories of school funding, student achievement and future student success. A correction and more recent rankings When we turned to verify the No. 43 ranking, we learned that the cited study was amended a few weeks after publication to correct errors in its initial school finance section. As a result, Texas schools edged up to rank 41st among the states (42nd if you count the District of Columbia). Also, we noticed, more recent Education Week studies, released in December 2016 and January 2018, respectively, show Texas schools ranking 40th among the states (41st if you count D.C.). To our inquiry, Sterling Lloyd of the Education Week Research Center summed up by email: "In the 2016 report, Texas received an overall grade of C-minus and a score of 69.7. In 2017, it earned a C-minus (70.2). For the 2018 grading, it got a C-minus (70.6). "So, the slight improvement in ranking between 2016 and the subsequent years reflects a modest gain in the state’s numerical score if not its letter grade. This change was driven by an improvement in Texas’ School Finance score, where it gained about a point between 2016 and 2017 and about a point between 2017 and 2018. The improvement for Texas in the School Finance score reflects gains on equity in the distribution of funding across districts within the state. For instance, the gap between the highest- and lowest-spending districts in Texas narrowed from 2016 to 2017 and from 2017 to 2018." Why Texas placed 40th White couldn’t have had the latest rankings when he announced his candidacy. So to learn more about Texas’ ranking, we focused on the second-to-latest breakdown. The publication’s web page presenting those state-by-state rankings, dated Dec. 30, 2016, shows Texas’s C-minus score of 70.2 trailing both No. 1 Massachusetts, with a B-grade score of 86.5, and the national C-grade average of 74.2. States with worse-than-Texas rankings included California, New Mexico, Oklahoma and, in last place, Nevada with a D-grade score of 65, the page shows. Texas got its C-minus based on the following Education Week-bestowed grades: SOURCE: Web page, "Quality Counts 2017: State Report Cards Map," Education Week, Dec. 30, 2016 A separate web post elaborates on how Texas fared, specifying that the state ranked 24th among the states and D.C. for its "K-12 Achievement Index," which takes into account 18 indicators; 39th in the "Chance-for-Success" category, which considers 13 indicators; and 44th for "School Finance." Other takes We looked next for perspective outside of Education Week. Houston Public Media’s story quoted the Texas Education Agency saying: "It’s difficult to effectively evaluate the state’s performance from a national report where no state made the highest" possible "grade, no state made the lowest grade and the majority of states were all lumped into the same grade category." When we followed up, the agency’s Lauren Callahan reaffirmed the quoted statement and also said by email that the agency doesn’t comment on rankings "since each utilizes a different methodology in determining a final grade." Callahan noted too that the agency has been assigned by law to implement a system giving A-to-F grades to campuses and districts. "Specifics of that system will be in place later this year," Callahan said. We also asked Children At Risk, a Houston-based nonprofit that appraises schools, what it makes of White’s cited rankings. Andy Canales replied by email that the group, which has worked with Education Week, considers the publication’s reports ranking the schools in each state to be sound studies "in line with research by Children At Risk." Holly Eaton of the Texas Classroom Teachers Association, which was among education advocacy groups that we asked to weigh in, pointed out that Texas spends less per student than many states. Generally, Eaton said by email, rankings can oversimplify. Notably, she said, the Education Week studies don’t adjust test results that figure into its grades to account for demographic differences. Once that’s done on results on the National Assessment of Educational Progress, Eaton noted, Texas surges close to having the nation’s best student performance results, according to research by the Urban Institute focused on 2013 and 2015 NAEP scores. By email, Lloyd agreed that it’s important to consider demographics when thinking about a state’s academic performance. But Education Week, he said, tries "to make our methodology for the grading as straightforward as possible. Adjusting for demographics can make the grading less straightforward for the public. It adds methodological details that need to be evaluated." Eaton later commented that Land’s response "illustrates the classic tension in performance reporting between the desire for clarity (thus oversimplification) vs accuracy (thus complexity)." We shared with Canela the fact that Texas schools lately rank 40th in the rankings and didn’t draw additional comment. Our ruling White has said Texas schools rank "43rd in the nation." In fact, Texas schools ranked 40th among the states heading into 2017, according to the latest Education Week rankings that were public before White spoke. We rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-13242	"Sen. (Richard) Burr voted no on the Violence Against Women Act."	half-true	/north-carolina/statements/2016/oct/18/deborah-ross/nc-senate-race-democrat-deborah-ross-ad-against-go/	In a recent campaign ad, North Carolina Democrat Deborah Ross blasted her opponent, Republican Sen. Richard Burr, for voting against the landmark Violence Against Women Act. "Sen. Burr voted no on the Violence Against Women Act," a narrator says in the ad, while the text, "Richard Burr: Opposed Violence Against Women Act," appears on the screen, along with a citation for a bill considered in the Senate in 2012. Here’s a screenshot from the ad: Is Ross’ ad correct? In part, but it it leaves out important context. What was Burr voting for? First, we should note that the ad used some loose language about what Burr was actually voting on. The 2012 vote referenced in the ad was for a reauthorization bill -- that is, an updating of the existing Violence Against Women Act, which had lapsed in 2011. Burr was not in Congress when the act itself was initially passed in 1994; he was sworn in for his first term in the U.S. House the following year, in 1995. The 2000 and 2005 votes Congress voted to reauthorize the act in both 2000 and 2005, and both legislative efforts were fairly uncontroversial. For the 2000 effort, Burr was in the House, and he voted in favor of the reauthorization, which was passed by the overwhelming margin of 415-3. While that version didn’t become law, another version did become law during that Congress; it passed the House by voice vote. Individual House members’ votes aren’t recorded in a voice vote, but they are usually only held for non-controversial measures. By the time the 2005 reauthorization effort rolled around, Burr had been elected to the Senate. The reauthorization bill passed the Senate by unanimous consent, a process by which senators are given a chance to object to a bill and, if there no objections are made, the bill is deemed passed. So Burr would not have opposed the 2005 reauthorization. The 2012 vote The 2012 reauthorization effort was far more controversial than the previous two, since it involved changes that some social conservatives found objectionable. At the time, the Democrats controlled the presidency and the Senate, while the Republicans controlled the House. The Senate bill would "allow Indian tribal courts to try certain non-Indians in some cases of domestic violence on reservations, expand the number of temporary visas for illegal immigrants who were victims of domestic violence and extend the protections of that act to gay men and lesbians," the New York Times reported at the time. These provisions were anathema to many conservatives, and when faced with a vote on April 26, 2012, Burr was one of 31 Republicans to vote against it, while 15 Republicans voted for it. Overall, the measure passed the chamber by a 60-31 margin. Instead, Burr voted for a failed Republican-sponsored amendment that would have stripped out some of the elements of the bill that were controversial to Republicans. We were unable to find a contemporaneous explanation by Burr on the reason for his vote through Google or Nexis. The only comment he made on the bill to a media outlet came was procedural rather than substantive, when he said that he thought there were more urgent bills for the chamber to prioritize than the reauthorization. Ultimately, the Republican-led House passed a version that omitted the provisions of the Senate bill that conservatives opposed. The House and Senate were unable to come to an agreement, and the measure was dead for the duration of that Congress. It’s worth noting that Politico reported on March 14, 2012, that the Democratic effort to push a vote on the Violence Against Women Act in the spring of 2012 was to make it a "political weapon." "Republicans have several objections to the legislation, but instead of making changes, Schumer wants to fast-track the bill to the floor, let the GOP block it, then allow Democrats to accuse Republicans of waging a ‘war against women,’ " the Politico story said. "It’s fodder for a campaign ad, and it’s not the only potential 30-second spot ready to spring from Senate leadership these days." With this ad, that mission was accomplished. The 2013 vote After the failure to get the two chambers to agree on a single version in 2012, the new Congress took up the effort again in 2013. Partisan control of each part of government remained the same in 2013, and the reauthorization effort played out in a similar fashion. Republicans pursued an amendment to strip out some of the elements they found problematic, such as the provisions related to native Americans and gender identity. On Feb. 7, 2013, the amendment failed by a 34-65 margin, with Burr voting in favor of it. Then, on Feb. 12, 2013, the Senate passed the original measure, 78-22. Burr was among a handful of Republican senators who switched their position and supported the bill. In fact, Burr has subsequently trumpeted elements of this bill. Burr joined with Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., to introduce the Child Protection Compact Act, which was enacted as part of the Violence Against Women Act reauthorization. This provision "seeks to protect and rescue children from trafficking by creating ‘Child Protection Compacts’ between the United States and countries with significant numbers of children in human trafficking," Burr’s Senate website says. On the other hand, the Ross camp argues, the refusal of Republicans to approve the original bill resulted in a year-long delay in the reauthorization, which kept sexual violence awareness and assistance programs on college campuses from being established, even though reports of sexual assault on college campuses were at an all-time high. So where does this leave us? The Ross camp argues that the ad is accurate since it said that Burr voted against the 2012 version of the bill. They have a point, but making this argument requires ignoring that Burr voted to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act three times -- in 2000, 2005 and 2013 -- even as he voted against it once, in 2012. The Ross camp also argues that the 2012 vote is important because Burr opposed -- and even voted to strip -- provisions involving LGBT and native Americans. They also have a point here, but their argument would have been stronger had the ad specifically cited Burr’s actions toward LGBT and native Americans. The ad makes no such distinctions; a viewer would be left to assume that he opposed anything to combat violence against women. Finally, we think it’s relevant to note here that, according to Politico, the Democrats specifically teed up this vote to put Republicans in a bind so they could use their votes in campaign ads -- a tactic that both parties have used when they are in a position to do so. Our ruling Ross’ ad said Burr "voted no on the Violence Against Women Act." Burr did vote against the 2012 version of the law’s reauthorization, which was important because it effectively meant delaying the revival of an act that had expired. However, the ad ignores that three other times over 13 years Burr voted for a reauthorization of the same law. We rate the statement Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/20e330b1-b189-4aaa-8daf-e644b117ea97	None	Deborah Ross	None	None	None	2016-10-18T19:07:36	2016-10-18	['None']
pomt-09477	The health care bill "dumps 15 to 18 million low-income Americans into a Medicaid program that none of us want to be a part of because 50 percent of doctors won't see new patients."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/01/lamar-alexander/health-care-reform-expand-Medicaid-doctors/	Little known fact: The health care bill will open up Medicaid to millions of Americans. The expansion has been overshadowed by debate over the public option, taxes on "Cadillac" health care plans, and a litany of other controversial items in the overhaul. But during the Feb. 25, 2010, health care summit between President Barack Obama and members of Congress, Sen. Lamar Alexander, a Tennessee Republican, pointed to the provision as one of his biggest problems with the bill. "It dumps 15 to 18 million low-income Americans into a Medicaid program that none of us want to be a part of because 50 percent of doctors won't see new patients," Alexander told Obama in his opening remarks. "So it's like giving someone a ticket to a bus line where the buses only run half the time." No one likes to wait for the bus, so we decided to look into Alexander's claim. Currently, Medicaid is available to low-income individuals who are pregnant, disabled, elderly or have children 18 years old or younger; the program covers about 60 million patients. The Senate and House health care bills, and Obama's latest health care proposal, would open up the program to all people under 65 with a low income. The Obama proposal and the Senate bill would offer Medicaid benefits to those with incomes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, while the House version would allow those with incomes up to 150 percent of the federal poverty level to enroll. All that would mean a major expansion of the program. Medicaid is funded jointly by the states and the federal government, but administered by the states. So, the proposed expansion has proven particularly controversial among state officials, who say local budgets are already strapped and can't handle additional enrollees. One of the biggest complaints among doctors is that Medicaid reimbursements are already too low. We asked Alexander's office for some information on the statement, and his spokesman, Ryan Loskarn, pointed us to two recent studies about impacts of the potential law change. The first, compiled by the Congressional Budget Office, was published on Dec. 19, 2009, and looked at the impact of the Senate bill's Medicaid expansion provision. The CBO estimated that the expansion would increase the number of enrollees in Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program by about 15 million, costing states about $26 billion over 10 years. (CBO does not specify how many of those would be only Medicaid patients, but the experts we spoke with told us that they would make up the vast majority of new enrollees.) The second study was published on Jan. 8, 2010, by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. According to the report, the Senate bill would put 18 million people on the Medicaid beneficiary list. An additional 2 million with employer-sponsored health insurance would enroll in Medicaid for supplemental coverage. So, if anything, Alexander is understating the high end of the overall estimate. Meanwhile, the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, a group that analyzes health care policy, estimated that Medicaid would enroll as many as 17.1 million new beneficiaries under the health care bill. So, by all accounts, Alexander is in the ballpark on how many people would be newly eligible for Medicaid. To back up the second part of Alexander's claim -- that 50 percent of doctors won't see new Medicaid patients -- Alexander's office pointed us to a 2007 Wall Street Journal article about access issues in Medicaid. The story mentioned a 2006 report from the Center for Studying Health System Change that estimated nearly half of doctors have stopped accepting or limited the number of Medicaid patients. According to that 2006 study, about 52 percent of doctors surveyed said they were accepting all new Medicaid patients, while only 21 percent said they were accepting no new patients. Presumably, the rest of the doctors surveyed were limiting to some degree the number of new Medicaid patients they were accepting. So, to say that 50 percent of doctors are accepting no new Medicaid patients based on that study is incorrect, said Alwyn Cassil, the group's director of public affairs. Furthermore, the Center for Studying Health System Change updated those figures in 2009 and provided more detail. Currently, 40.2 percent of doctors are accepting all new Medicaid patients, 12.4 percent are accepting most, 19.2 percent are accepting some, and 28.2 percent are accepting no new patients. Cassil did emphasize the fact that the 2006 study and the 2009 study are hard to compare because the group has changed its survey methods in the last few years. In 2006, for example, the group spoke with doctors over the phone. This time around, they administered a written survey. So, the group doesn't know if the most recent statistics are really worse than they were a few years ago or if patient rejection was simply underreported during the last survey. Nevertheless, Alexander raises a good point, Cassil said. "It is a valid point to raise, physician willingness to accept new Medicaid patients," she said. "If you're going to be throwing another 15 million into the program, you've got to be thinking about that." Joan Alker, executive director for the Georgetown Center for Children and Families, agreed that Alexander's statement is generally true, but glosses over some important details. "I would say that certainly, access to physicians is a concern and that there's room for improvement," she said. "But being on Medicaid provides more access to patients," than they would get if they had no insurance at all. Alexander's statement "suggests that having Medicaid is meaningless, which is misleading." Leighton Ku, a health policy professor at George Washington University, said that those statistics are more nuanced than they seem. First, he pointed out, Medicaid patients surveyed often don't report great difficulty in finding doctors. But more importantly, Medicaid patients tend to be concentrated; there are many doctors that see just a few Medicaid patients, and a handful of clinics that see a lot. So, it's reasonable to think that some doctors aren't seeing new Medicaid patients because there are not many in their area. Finally, he said, many primary care physicians aren't seeing new patients at all, whether they are on Medicaid or have private insurance. In the first part of his statement, Alexander is in the ballpark: Anywhere from 15 to 18 million new patients could enroll in Medicaid if the health care overhaul is put into law. We also found that Alexander's underlying point, that some Medicaid patients might have trouble finding doctors, is a valid concern. But he overstates the percentage of doctors that won't accept new Medicaid patients and based that claim on old data. As a result, we find Alexander's claim to be Half True.

pomt-07735	Says Tri-Rail shows the potential problems with investing in high-speed rail.	mostly false	/florida/statements/2011/mar/01/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-raps-tri-rail-while-rejecting/	It's become Florida Gov. Rick Scott's version of a campfire ghost story: Stay away from high-speed rail, or you'll wind up with a huge money suck on your hands. Just like Tri-Rail in South Florida. Scott has repeatedly tried to draw parallels between the two rail systems, saying the 71-mile commuter train now running through Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade counties is hardly covering its costs. So why would the Orlando to Tampa system? Scott again drilled home the point during a national TV appearance on Feb. 27, 2011, when he was asked to explain his decision to reject $2.4 billion in federal funding for the high-speed rail line. "What I have said all along is our taxpayers aren't going to take the risk of the cost overrun in building it. It could be $3 billion ...," Scott told CNN's Candy Crowley. "We already have a train that goes from Palm Beach to Miami. Only one-sixth of the cost of operation is covered by the fares." While legislators and the Florida Department of Transportation said private contractors would be required to pay for any high-speed rail construction cost overruns, Scott halted the project before it went out for bid. So we can't really check that part of his statement. But we can examine his comparison to the Tri-Rail system. The numbers for Tri-Rail The Tri-Rail system started operating in 1989 as a temporary way to alleviate traffic congestion that was expected to be created by a massive road-widening project on Interstate 95. But the state Legislature decided to keep the system alive permanently through a funding agreement between the state and Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties. The federal government also helps fund the rail line through the Federal Highway Administration and the Federal Transit Administration. A total of 3.6 million riders used Tri-Rail in fiscal year 2010, down from 4.2 million riders in FY 2009. Scott described his problems with Tri-Rail in more detail during a Feb. 21 interview with the St. Petersburg Times, and suggested its story acts as a warning for people considering the high-speed rail proposal. "Let's all remember. We have Tri-Rail right now. Tri-Rail costs us $64 million to operate. The fares only cover $10 million of it," he said. "The state's funding almost $35 million of that. So I'm not going to put our state taxpayers in a similar position." The fuller context of Scott's thoughts on Tri-Rail better explain his comment to CNN that only one-sixth of the cost of operation is covered by fares -- fares of about $10 million divided into a $64 million operating budget. We reached out to the governor's office to ask them about their figures, but we did not get a response. So we turned to the South Florida Regional Transportation Authority, the agency that oversees Tri-Rail. According to the authority's certified financial reports, Tri-Rail took in about $10.3 million in operating revenues in fiscal year 2010 -- an increase of $3 million since 2007. That's the good news. The bad? Operating expenses totaled $54.5 million in FY 2010, according to the financial reports. Bonnie Arnold, a spokeswoman for the authority, confirmed the figures in the report. She said the authority also received $10 million in federal money for preventative maintenance, which might be how Scott arrived at his $64 million figure. That's in addition to the normal operating subsidies provided by the federal government. The financial report concluded that rider fares covered between one-fourth and one-fifth of Tri-Rail's operating costs in 2010 (23 percent, see Page 63 of the report), up from 22 percent in 2009 and 19 percent in 2008. The rest of the money comes in the form of subsidies from the state, the counties and the federal government. The report reveals that Scott is a little off by saying one-sixth, which is the equivalent of about 17 percent. But the more important question is whether Tri-Rail's failures at the fare box really are evidence that high-speed rail won't work as it's proposed? Are the two rail lines enough alike for comparison? That's where this claim gets off track. A subsidy surprise? Governments and transportation experts walked into the Tri-Rail project with their eyes wide open. They knew the project would be subsidized by taxpayers. The question was just how much. The legislation that created the Tri-Rail line required the commuter system to recoup 60 percent of its operating costs. That number, however, was quickly panned as unrealistic. "Almost no one can recover that," then Tri-Rail executive director William Howard told the South Florida Business Journal in 1988, before the system was even operating. The pessimism was shared by George Sirianni, a public transportation specialist with the Florida Department of Transportation. Sixty percent is "really high," he said. "The national average for public transportation systems is only about 20 to 30 percent." In 1992, the state formally amended its requirement, saying that Tri-Rail needed to recoup 25 percent of its costs, according to the Miami Herald. That's about the what the system now pays for, though it's not what was initially anticipated by the Legislature. Compare that to the Tampa-Orlando line, where experts say there will be no public government subsidy. The most recent available ridership studies for the Tampa-Orlando line predict about 2.4 million riders in the system's first year, enough to cover the operational expenses of the system. In rejecting federal funding, Scott said he was briefed on a new ridership study that concluded the system would have 3.07 million riders annually. We're assuming the new study concludes that passengers will cover the costs to operate the high-speed rail line. (We can't say for certain because the state has yet to make that study available, and in fact, has taken down the official web site discussing the high-speed rail project.) So to recap, Tri-Rail was created with the idea it would be subsidized; high-speed rail is being proposed as a system that won't need government support. But that's not the only difference. The Tampa-Orlando line would have five stops over 84 miles of track, with trains reaching speeds up to 168 mph. A trip between Tampa and the Orlando International Airport would take 55 minutes, according to estimates. Tri-Rail, meanwhile, has 18 stops over 71 miles and it takes one hour, 55 minutes to travel from one end of the route to the other. Rob Gregg, director of transit management and innovation at the University of South Florida's Center for Urban Transportation Research, said high-speed rail is like an interstate while commuter rail is like a parkway. The clienteles, and costs, would be different, too, said Stephen L. Reich, another USF transportation expert. Tri-Rail is mainly intended to serve people coming to and from work, while more than one-third of projected passengers on the high-speed line would be tourists traveling from Orlando International Airport to Disney World. A one-way ticket on the high-speed rail would cost an estimated $15 to $30, depending on how far a rider travels. On Tri-Rail, commuters can purchase an unlimited monthly pass for $100 and a roundtrip ticket cost between $4.40 and $11.50. "The high-speed rail and Tri-Rail systems are different in technology, application and target markets," Gregg said. "Tri-Rail is targeting commuters/workers during peak congestion periods. The high-speed rail corridor surely targets tourists as well as business/commuter trips. "What should be reflected upon is the larger context of investing/subsidizing such systems relative to the entire transportation system (roads, transit, airports, etc.) and economic viability to the region (generating jobs, products, services and thus revenues)," Gregg said. "Disney, a profit-motivated business, 'subsidizes' its comprehensive transportation system (trams, buses, monorail, Cruise Coaches) as a part of its entire financial model." Look at the side-by-side of the two projects. In Tri-Rail's case, subsidies were always anticipated, but high-speed rail is projected to cover its own costs through ticket fares. Riders of Tri-Rail use the system to commute to work in South Florida, while Central Florida's high-speed rail will be used for more leisure and tourist travel. The ticket prices, train speeds and time schedules are all projected to be be dramatically different. The costs and benefits of Tri-Rail are simply not the same as the high-speed rail, and expecting them to operate the same way is misguided. Subsidies dog more than just rail projects Most of the talk here is about subsidies. Scott is right that they are typical for rail systems. But they also are typical for most every other form of transportation system. We did some research. In Jacksonville, the local bus service covers around only 20 percent of its costs through rider fares. The majority of its money comes from government -- the biggest chunk from the city of Jacksonville. In Pinellas County, riders are only paying for about 23 percent of the cost of the Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority bus system, said spokesman Bob Lasher. Property tax collections are keeping that system running. Highways, too, rely on more than just fees paid by users through tolls or gas taxes. According to an analysis by the Pew Charitable Trust, only half of the federal money set aside in 2007 for highway construction and maintenance was generated by user fees. That's down from 10 years earlier when user fees made up 61 percent of total spending on roads, Pew found. Scott has asked that the $2.4 billion he is rejecting for rail be used in the state for port and highway projects. The federal government has said the money will be used for rail. Robert Puentes, senior fellow and director of the Metropolitan Infrastructure Initiative at the Brookings Institution, said the comparison between Tri-Rail and high-speed rail is like comparing apples to oranges. "If comparing different types of rail, you would also have to look at highway travel and the enormous subsidies there to be fair," Puentes said. Our ruling If Scott were on a crusade to end public subsidies for all forms of transportation, that would be one thing. Transportation systems -- including roads, buses, ports and trains -- more than not require government help. But Scott is trying to isolate the problem to trains when citing Tri-Rail's revenue problems as a reason for nixing high-speed rail in Central Florida. It may be a convenient talking point, but the two systems are hardly alike. In the end, high-speed fail might fail and the projections for ridership might be too rosy. But people shouldn't use Tri-Rail as evidence any more than they should cite any other form of mass transit. We rate this claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-08693	John Boehner said the jobs of "teachers and nurses and police officers and firefighters" are "'government jobs' that weren't worth saving."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/08/barack-obama/obama-says-boehner-doesnt-think-jobs-teachers-poli/	President Barack Obama defended his economic policies in a campaign-style speech in Milwaukee on Labor Day, drawing a sharp contrast with Republicans in Congress. "When it comes to just about everything we've done to strengthen our middle class, to rebuild our economy, almost every Republican in Congress says no," Obama said. "Even on things we usually agree on, they say no. If I said the sky was blue, they say no. If I said fish live in the sea, they'd say no." Obama mentioned specific legislation and singled out Republican House leader John Boehner of Ohio for criticism. "When we passed a bill earlier this summer to help states save jobs -- the jobs of hundreds of thousands of teachers and nurses and police officers and firefighters that were about to be laid off -- they said no. And the Republican who thinks he's going to take over as speaker... when he was asked about this, he dismissed those jobs as 'government jobs' that weren't worth saving. That's what he said, I'm quoting -- 'government jobs.'" We wanted to check Boehner's comments to see if Obama was making an accurate claim. Obama signed the bill into law on Aug. 10. It sends $26.1 billion to states facing budget shortfalls, providing $10 billion for salaries and compensation for teachers and another $16.1 million to help states pay for Medicaid, the long-standing government insurance program for the poor and disabled. Medicaid is a major part of state budgets, and Democrats says that this funding will help states avoid cuts to other parts of their budgets that pay for public employees like "nurses and police officers and firefighters." We want to be clear that the law only directly funds teachers. The other job categories are potential secondary effects and likely vary by state. We checked with the White House about what Boehner said about those jobs, and they pointed us to remarks he made in a major speech on the economy in Cleveland on Aug. 24, 2010. Boehner criticized the Obama administration's economic policies both broadly and in several specifics. One of the news highlights from the speech was Boehner's advice that Obama fire his top economic advisers, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and National Economic Council director Larry Summers. But Boehner also singled out the state aid package for brief criticism. Businesses, he said, are not creating jobs because of uncertainty about what the federal government will do, something he said he told Obama in a recent meeting. "Not long after we spoke, he signed a $26 billion 'stimulus' spending bill that funnels money to state governments in order to protect government jobs. And even worse, the bill is funded by a new tax hike that makes it more expensive to create jobs in the United States and less expensive to create jobs overseas. Listen, this cannot continue," Boehner said. (The quotes around "stimulus" are from the text Boehner's office posted online.) So, Boehner did call the jobs the bill aimed to save "government jobs." To be clear, public school teachers are government employees. But did Boehner say they "weren't worth saving"? The quote above is the only time Boehner specifically mentions that law in the speech, but he repeatedly condemns government spending and says that real job creation must come from the private sector. He does not mention the professions of teachers, nurses, police or firefighters, and he never said that "government jobs" weren't worth saving. We asked Boehner spokesman Michael Steel about Obama's charge. He said that Boehner "did not say that government jobs, 'weren't worth saving.' The president's statement is inaccurate." (Two days after the Labor Day speech, Obama repeated the remarks in a speech in Cleveland but softened them slightly. This time Obama said that Boehner "dismissed these jobs – teaching our kids, patrolling our streets, rushing into burning buildings – as quote 'government jobs – jobs that I guess he thought just weren't worth saving.") Obama's Labor Day statement was accurate in that Boehner did refer did refer to teachers' jobs as government jobs. But the Republican leader did not say government jobs weren't worth saving. He merely said the stimulus was misguided because it put too much emphasis on government spending. So we rate Obama's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-15124	"Contrary to media reports, Georgia’s gas tax change led to no price increase at the pump."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2015/sep/09/e-frank-stephenson/georgia-gas-taxes-despite-pump-price-fall/	Anyone who took a road trip over Labor Day – or paid attention to headlines over the holiday – couldn’t help but notice prices at the pump. The national average of regular gasoline hovered at $2.40 a gallon over the weekend and dipped another penny to $2.39 a gallon by Tuesday, according to AAA. Georgia matched that average, and Atlanta even fared better, with metro drivers paying an average of $2.34 a gallon. That’s the lowest price since 2004 – despite a change in the state gasoline tax over the summer that critics warned was a tax hike for Georgia drivers. PolitiFact Georgia already ruled claims about a tax hike as Mostly True. The chairman of Berry College’s economics department, writing for the Georgia Public Policy Foundation, suggested that media reports were "surprising" given the change would not and did not mean higher gas prices. "Contrary to media reports, Georgia’s gas tax change led to no price increase at the pump," according to the piece by economics professor E. Frank Stephenson and student Clay G. Collins. "There may well be some good reasons to criticize the transportation bill, but hiking gas taxes isn’t one of them." Did we miss something in our earlier assessment of Georgia’s gas taxes? We decided to revisit the issue and, sadly, the math. The history As a reminder, lawmakers changed how drivers pay gas taxes as of July 1, as part of a larger transportation funding bill. Switching from a 7.5 cent per gallon and excise tax and a 4 percent state sales tax per gallon to a single 26 cent excise tax on gasoline is projected to raise nearly $670 million this year. In our previous fact-check, we noted that the effective rate then would jump from 17 cents per gallon to 26 cents, or 9 cents before local sales taxes are included. However, analysts at the right-leaning Tax Foundation pointed out that the price of gas would play a role in the final price. In short, prices weren’t expected to jump 9 cents overnight. But the amount motorists paid would increase over time, as gas prices and inflation increased. The Berry College analysis Stephenson did something similar in his analysis. He and Collins (a student who did not return requests for comment) used AAA and gasbuddy.com to find monthly gas prices in Georgia and the surrounding states for June and July – before and after the change took place here. In June, the research showed Georgians paid an average of $2.71 per gallon of gas. They paid about $2.63 a gallon in July – a drop of 8 cents after the change in how taxes are paid. Stephenson and Collins used prices in Alabama, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee as the control for market factors such as crude oil prices. They found the neighboring states’ average price per gallon was $2.59 in June and $2.51 in July. In other words, Georgia saw the same drop in gas prices as its neighbors, even though it alone changed how it taxed gasoline. In an email, Stephenson rejected the idea that change created a net tax increase, given those final prices. "Market prices indicate otherwise because Georgia’s gas prices changed in line with neighboring states," Stephenson wrote. "Your suggestion is that prices in neighboring states should have decreased 8-9 cents more than prices in Georgia but that just didn’t happen." Math matters The figures Stephenson uses in his analysis are easily, and readily verifiable. But does the price at the pump really mean taxes didn’t go up? Not if you do the math, which PolitiFact Georgia did with the help of a second economist, Bruce Seaman, a Georgia State professor who specialties include public sector taxation. Using Stephenson’s own figures, we first looked at what would have happened if, in June, the new tax system was in effect. That requires taking the $2.71 pump price, and subtracting the then-existing 7.5-cent excise tax to get to $2.62 and dividing by the state and local sales taxes of 7 percent. That leaves us with a $2.46 per gallon price, without taxes. Under the new tax structure of a 26 cent excise tax and 3 percent local sales tax on every gallon, the price would have been $2.79. In other words, there would have been about an 8 cent increase in the price if the new system was in place in June. And in July? Applying similar math, the $2.63 pump price would have been $2.45 without any taxes. And under the previous tax system, the pump price would have been $2.54 per gallon – meaning motorists would have paid about 9 cents less had the tax structure not changed. Seaman said while it was an interesting point that Georgia’s change in prices was similar to neighboring states, the data likely exaggerates the point that the tax increase is just not immediately evident. "My dilemma is he concludes that Georgia did not experience a net tax increase, even though when holding market forces constant, the math suggests there was," Seaman said. "I have to admit, as I’m sitting here right now, I don’t have a great explanation for why, even over one month, we benefitted more in the market than other states from the decline in refinery gas prices," Seaman added. "But that doesn’t change the math, that there is a net tax increase." Stephenson did not respond to specific questions about the math but said the argument that the market is camouflaging the tax increase "relies on having some price decrease that was specific to Georgia, was the same magnitude as the putative tax increase, and was at the same time as the would-be tax increase." An 18-month review of gas prices show that Georgia’s prices have increased relative to neighboring states but did not during the tax change, Stephenson added. But Seaman said even that data had anomalies that "are not inconsistent with Georgia having bigger price reductions, without the tax change, and lower prices than other states." Our ruling In Atlanta’s car-centric world, gas prices are nearly as hot a topic as bad drivers. So Berry College economist E. Frank Stephenson caught our attention with his piece that the change how Georgia taxes gasoline was "much ado about nothing" because an analysis of prices before and after the change show rather than increasing taxes, pump prices went down this summer. "Georgia’s gas tax change led to no price increase at the pump," Stephenson wrote in dismissing warnings of a tax increase. Stephenson is correct that average gas prices dropped this summer in Georgia, where we plunged to an 11-year low during the recent Labor Day weekend. He used neighboring states to show that Georgia prices dropped the same as states that did not alter their gas taxes this summer. That analysis, however, doesn’t indicate what sorts of market forces could depress pump prices, even as a growing share of that cost is taxes. And, the math shows just what was predicted when Georgia switched to a higher statewide excise tax on July 1: motorists paying several cents more per gallon than they would have under the former system. If not for the tax change, Georgia motorists would be paying even less at the pump now. Stephenson uses accurate numbers but leaves out critical facts that provide that important context. We rate his claim Half True.	None	E. Frank Stephenson	None	None	None	2015-09-09T00:00:00	2015-08-14	['None']
pomt-14133	Cervical cancer in Africa is "fully preventable with basic education, screening and vaccines."	mostly true	/global-news/statements/2016/may/05/joe-biden/biden-says-cervical-cancertotally-preventable-afri/	Vice President Joe Biden has called for a "moonshot" to cure cancer. The disease took his son in 2015, and now it has become his mission to eliminate some cancers and turn the rest into treatable, chronic diseases. Biden took his campaign to the Vatican where he said that "nearly 50 percent of cancers are preventable." "Take cervical cancer --  530,000 new cases are diagnosed each year," Biden said. "270,000 people die each year; 87 percent in developing countries. In Africa, it’s the second-most common cancer after breast cancer. It’s a travesty. But it’s fully preventable with basic education, screening, and vaccines." Biden’s comment about cervical cancer in Africa caught our attention. Is cervical cancer fully preventable with the right interventions? A fact-sheet on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s website tells us that Biden is almost but not quite right. "Every year in the U.S., more than 12,000 women get cervical cancer, and 4,000 die from it. 93 percent of cervical cancer deaths could be prevented through screening and HPV vaccination." Now, that is for the United States with a system of doctors, clinics and hospitals that far surpasses anything found in any African nation. If it’s not fully preventable here, it’s difficult to see why the results in Africa would be better. Beth Meyerson, a researcher at the School of Public Health at Indiana University is in the middle of a study on cervical cancer strategies in Africa. Meyerson told us "Sub-Saharan Africa would not be able to achieve 100 percent prevention." Meghan Dubyak, a Biden spokeswoman, said the vice president was trying to make a slightly different point. "The vice president was referring to the travesty of cervical cancer being preventable," Dubyak said. To be sure, cervical cancer is highly preventable. The journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention, says "cervical cancer is a relatively rare disease in countries that have instituted and maintained national screening programs." In this light, Biden’s statement draws attention to Africa’s unfortunate distinction. As this World Health Organization map shows, it is a hotspot worldwide for cervical cancer. In every dark blue country, the rate of new cases is over 30.2 per 100,000 women per year. By comparison, the rate in the United States is about 8.1 per 100,000 women per year. Of the 20 nations with the highest incidence of cervical cancer, 16 are in Sub-Saharan Africa. (Some researchers note there are vast gaps in this cancer data and say the true prevalence "remains largely unknown.") A 2015 report from the Sub-Saharan African Cervical Cancer Working Group, a body of physicians, epidemiologists and cancer researchers, described the key reasons behind the reach of the disease. Screening is sorely lacking. The group found a "lack of widespread services, delays in receiving results, lack of the high-quality laboratories needed for cytology based screening and absence of adequate centres for the evaluation and treatment of identified patients." Dealing with cervical cancer exposes the many cracks in the health care systems across the region. Richard Wamai, assistant professor of public health at Northeastern University, said the countries of Sub-Saharan Africa are ill equipped for this challenge. "Detection will require expanding the health service system, which requires investments in infrastructure," Wamai said. "That calls for prioritization which is difficult to do because of competing health demands. Cancer in general is, to me, the most worrying of all other diseases for the continent. There is very little preparation and in many cases policy makers are not yet awoken to this impending tsunami." Public health experts also say vaccination programs are essential. Some strains of human papillomavirus (HPV) can lead to cervical cancer and some of those strains can be blocked by vaccines. But just as Sub-Saharan countries lack the infrastructure for screening, they also lack a system for vaccinating young women. Speaking at a January 2016 event in Washington, Deborah Birx, U.S. Special Representative for Global Health Diplomacy, gave a bleak summary of the status of health care in Sub-Saharan Africa. "There is no systematic health care for girls between the time they turn 5 and the time they get pregnant," Birx said. That age range would be key for any vaccination program. On top of that core challenge, Meyerson said the price tag for vaccines puts them out of reach. "Many African countries find that the HPV vaccination cost is too high to have broad coverage," Meyerson said. Our ruling Biden said cervical cancer in Africa is "fully preventable with basic education, screening, and vaccines." The experience of the developed countries shows that nearly all deaths from cervical cancer could be eliminated with widespread screening and vaccination programs. Neither currently exist in Africa, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. We rate the claim Mostly True.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/19d8a964-9041-48d5-be9a-f0efd6eaa027	None	Joe Biden	None	None	None	2016-05-05T18:04:10	2016-05-02	['Africa']
pomt-01169	The authors of a report on CIA’s torture techniques "never interviewed a single CIA official."	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/dec/11/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-committees-torture-report-failed-/	In a preemptive strike to a Senate committee report detailing past examples of alleged torture by the CIA, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio called the release of the document "reckless and irresponsible." Rubio raised concerns that the release could endanger lives of Americans overseas, incite violence and create problems for our allies. "The one-sided report that will be released by Democrats on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence cost U.S. taxpayers over $40 million dollars to produce, and its authors never interviewed a single CIA official," Rubio wrote in a statement with Sen. Jim. Risch, R-Idaho, on Dec. 8. The report garnered widespread media coverage upon its release. But did the authors really fail to interview a single CIA official? We took a closer look. CIA torture report drew from inspector general interviews On Dec. 9, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence released a report about the CIA’s interrogation techniques in the wake of 9/11 that had been years in the making. About 500 pages of the 6,700 page report were made public. The report concluded that the techniques were not an effective way to gain intelligence from detainees, and that the CIA misled Congress and the White House. The report detailed such techniques as "rectal rehydration" and the use of coffin-size confinement boxes. Rubio has a point that the committee did not conduct face-to-face interviews with CIA employees and contractors. Here’s how the report addresses that point: "CIA employees and contractors who would otherwise have been interviewed by the committee staff were under potential legal jeopardy, and therefore the CIA would not compel its workforce to appear before the committee." But there are two wrinkles. First, then-CIA Director Michael Hayden -- whose tenure started in 2006 years after the interrogation techniques under scrutiny started -- testified in a closed-door session before the committee in 2007, though the committee deemed the testimony less than entirely helpful. A 38-page appendix in the report -- "Example of Inaccurate CIA Testimony to the Committee April 12, 2007" -- shows how Hayden’s testimony conflicted with CIA records on multiple points including the number of detainees, the information gleaned from them and interrogation tactics used. For example, Hayden suggested that the CIA interrogation program was successful in obtaining intelligence from all detainees. But the report counters, "CIA records reveal that 34 percent of the 119 known CIA detainees produced no intelligence reports." The second problem with Rubio’s claim is that the report did draw from existing interviews of CIA officials, not to mention "more than six million pages of CIA materials," including "operational cables, intelligence reports, internal memoranda and emails, briefing materials" and other records. Specifically, the committee had access to interviews of CIA officials that had been conducted by the CIA's inspector general, as well as the CIA’s oral history program. A background document provided by U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, the committee’s chair, stated, "These documents included summaries of more than 100 CIA inspector general interviews with extensive quotations, as well as CIA cables, emails, letters, briefing notes, intelligence products, classified testimony, and other records. Of particular value were the interview summaries, which included responses to many of the questions the committee would have asked had the committee been able to conduct its own interviews." The interview reports and transcripts included former CIA director George Tenet; Jose Rodriguez, director of the CIA’s counterterrorism center, CIA General Counsel Scott Muller; CIA Deputy Director of Operations James Pavitt; CIA Acting General Counsel John Rizzo; CIA Deputy Director John McLaughlin; and a variety of interrogators, lawyers, medical personnel, senior counterterrorism analysts and managers of the detention and interrogation program, according to Feinstein. Rubio spokeswoman Brooke Sammon said the senator didn’t count Hayden’s interview because it pre-dated the 2009 start of work on the report. "Any appearance before that was simply the CIA director appearing before the oversight committee," told PolitiFact. As for the transcripts of prior interviews, Sammon echoed a point in the Republicans’ minority report that argues that transcripts of interviews done by the inspector general aren’t the same as if the committee had done their own, fresh interviews. The minority report criticizes the study for "failure to interview the relevant intelligence officers" and argues that it led to "significant analytical and factual errors." Republicans withdrew their participation in the study in 2009 when Attorney General Eric Holder decided to re-open the criminal inquiry. But the minority report argues that the committee could have interviewed witnesses after the Justice Department closed the investigation in August 2013. Examples of information from CIA interviews cited in report However, there’s ample evidence that the interviews of CIA officials provided the report’s authors with details about the interrogation of specific detainees and techniques. For example, it includes multiple statements about "Cobalt," a detention facility. The agency’s chief of interrogations told the inspector general that Cobalt "is good for interrogations because it is the closest thing he has seen to a dungeon, facilitating the displacement of detainee expectations." One senior interrogator told the inspector general that his team found one detainee who, "'as far as we could determine,' had been chained to the wall in a standing position for 17 days." The report also includes information about the waterboarding of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of 9/11. James Pavitt , the CIA’s deputy director of operations, told the inspector general that he "did not recall specifically ordering that a detainee be waterboarded right away," but he "did not discount that possibility." Experts weigh in on the report We checked with intelligence experts to see whether the lack of face-to-face interviews with CIA employees (other than Hayden) casts a shadow on the report, and most said the committee had plenty of testimony to draw from without them. While in-person interviews with CIA officials could have potentially been useful to the committee, said Anthony Clark Arend, a government and foreign service professor at Georgetown University, "all the necessary information that could have been obtained from those interviews was available to the committee through other means." University of Notre Dame law professor Mary Ellen O’Connell, a specialist on international law, said the large amount of information from CIA officials available from the inspector general and other sources meant that the Senate panel had "ample basis on which to draw conclusions." "Indeed, this testimony could be viewed as more reliable than anything officials might have given directly to an investigating committee, given that such a committee and staff might have been viewed as adversarial," she said. Patrick Eddington, a former CIA analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, noted that the CIA was given the opportunity to respond to the draft report. He also noted that the CIA’s current director, John Brennan, submitted his response to the committee and mentioned that an agency review team responded to the report. "I do not think the reliance on other investigative transcripts—especially those of the CIA IG —in any way diminishes the power of this report summary," Eddington said. Our ruling Rubio said that the authors of a report on CIA’s torture techniques "never interviewed a single CIA official." He has a point that the committee did not conduct fresh, face-to-face interviews with CIA officers as it was writing the report. However, this glosses over important context. The committee used testimony by then-CIA director Hayden, and the committee had access to transcripts of numerous prior interviews of key CIA officials conducted by the Inspector General and other entities. Rubio’s statement creates the misleading impression that the report wasn’t based at all on interviews with CIA employees, and that’s not the case. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2014-12-11T11:08:36	2014-12-08	['Central_Intelligence_Agency']
pomt-02332	Florida's revenue "is growing at a faster rate than almost any state in the country."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/mar/26/jeb-bush/floridas-revenue-growing-faster-rate-almost-any-st/	Former Gov. Jeb Bush waved off any talk of a 2016 presidential run at a meeting of Broward County business leaders on March 21, 2014. Instead, he spent a lot of time talking up Florida’s rebound from the Great Recession. Bush said Tallahassee had been hit hard in the last few years, but was making a comeback. "The revenue of the state is growing at a faster rate than almost any state in the country, because our state has been fiscally well managed and we grew our way out of the hole," he told attendees at the Broward Workshop business breakfast in Davie. It’s probably fair to say the state has bounced back from the worst of the economic downturn, but is the revenue rate outpacing the rest of the country? We wanted to hold Bush accountable. Revenue reporting State revenues can include any number of sources -- property taxes, sales taxes, corporate income taxes, agency fees and even the Lottery. Florida doesn’t have a personal income tax, relying heavily on sales tax dollars. We asked Bush’s camp to elaborate on what the former governor meant when he made the claim, but they didn’t specify how he arrived at his conclusion. Lucy Dadayan, a senior policy analyst at the Rockefeller Institute of Government, suggested looking at general revenue numbers since 2008, when the effects of the recession really began to take hold nationwide. General revenue from a state’s own sources is a better way to account for budgeting, because unlike total revenue accounting, it’s not subject to federal aid or trust fund cash. The Institute used Census data to calculate total taxes and miscellaneous general revenue to determine how much each state brought in for fiscal year 2012, the last year with complete Census data. (Dadayan said the Census Bureau’s annual numbers are more reliable than quarterly data.) The institute found the state’s collections for taxes and other revenue were still 7 percent lower in 2012 (almost $48 billion) compared with 2008 (almost $51.6 billion), making Florida 15th out of 19 states that had not yet rebounded to pre-recession levels. "The numbers don’t support the statement, if we look at the bigger picture, rather than the nominal growth in the most recent quarters," Dadayan said. If we were to look at total revenue in the same time period, Florida has risen dramatically from 2008 ($68.9 billion) to 2012 ($82.8 billion), about 20 percent. That increase is impressive until you compare it to a year earlier, when the state’s total revenue was $98.2 billion. That means Florida is down 15.7 percent since 2007. Many reports look at revenue in terms of total taxes, including income and sales taxes, by quarters, which gives us another option for examining the data. So what is the most recent quarterly growth rate, and how does it compare to the rest of the country? Between the first and second quarters of 2013, Florida had a 4.5 percent increase in total tax revenues, the Rockefeller Institute reported. That makes Florida 33rd in the nation for revenue growth. If we do that calculation as a year-over-year change from 2012 to 2013, the Institute said Florida had a 4 percent rate increase during the fourth quarter. In that measure, Florida is 17th among all states. The National Conference of State Legislatures focused on state general fund revenues in its report on State Budget Actions for the 2013 and 2014 fiscal years. That measure excluded intergovernmental funds and revenues dedicated to programs outside of the general fund, policy analyst Todd Haggerty said. The report found Florida’s revenue increased 5.9 percent from fiscal year 2012 to 2013. That made Florida 20th on the list. For fiscal year 2014, the NCSL estimated the state’s general fund growth rate at 4.5 percent, putting Florida in a tie for seventh place with Massachusetts. That’s a specific measure based on an estimate for the next fiscal year, which begins July 1. So while there are other ways to parse numbers, there’s not much to support the claim, according to Nick Johnson, the vice president for state fiscal policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. He said the 2014 estimate should be taken with a grain of salt, because every state reports its own estimates, and those estimates have different criteria. States also account for general funds differently. "On the whole, I'd say Florida's revenue growth lately has been mediocre, certainly nothing to brag about," Johnson said. The ruling Bush said that "the revenue of the state is growing at a faster rate than almost any state in the country." A few reports compiled with data encompassing different kinds of revenue can be confusing, but all paint the same picture: Florida revenues are still down from pre-recession levels, and don’t generally reflect a growth rate consistent with what Bush is claiming, either annually or in recent quarters. There is one report that says 2014 general revenue is expected to grow at a rate in the top 10 of all states. That data is self-reported from the state, however, and is only an estimate. According to experts we talked to, the Sunshine State is lagging behind the rest of the nation when it comes to getting its revenues back to pre-recession levels. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-11143	Speaking of immigration cases, says, "We have thousands of judges."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/30/donald-trump/donald-trumps-false-claim-about-thousands-immigrat/	President Donald Trump has denounced the way the United States processes immigration cases, calling for thousands more judges to address a backlog on top of the current ranks. Trump highlighted the role of judges in immigration proceedings in early May after he falsely attributed a "catch and release" immigration practice to Democrats. "We have thousands of judges. Do you think other countries have judges?" Trump said. "We give them, like, trials. That’s the good news. The bad news is, they never show up for the trial. Okay?" In a May 24 interview with Fox News’ Brian Kilmeade, Trump again said the United States was the only country that had judges, while others had "security people. People that stand there and say you can't come in." "We have thousands of judges, and they need thousands of more judges. The whole system is corrupt. It's horrible," Trump said. "So yeah, you need thousands of judges based on this crazy system. Whoever heard of a system where you put people through trials? Where do these judges come from? You know a judge is a very special person. How do you hire thousands of people to be a judge? So it's ridiculous. We are going to change the system. We have no choice for the good of our country." Trump’s conversation with Kilmeade centered on immigration, so we wondered if there are "thousands of judges" clearing immigration cases. Far from it. Fewer than 400 judges currently have this task. There also aren’t that many federal judges who hear other matters. (Immigration is regulated at the federal level.) There are slightly over 1,300 Article III federal judges that serve on the the Supreme Court, courts of appeals, district courts, and U.S. Court of International Trade. Adding the current number of immigration judges to that count still falls short of "thousands." The White House did not offer data to back Trump’s claim of "thousands" of judges, but pointed to remarks he made in April about increasing the number of immigration judges. "We’re trying to hire thousands of judges," Trump said during a roundtable discussion on tax reform. The number of pending immigration cases has been increasing over the years. In fiscal year 2008, there were about 186,000 pending cases. That number has grown substantially over the last decade. Nearly 700,000 immigration cases were pending as of March 31, 2018. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 provided funding for the hiring of at least 100 additional immigration judge teams with a goal of fielding 484 immigration judge teams nationwide by 2019, according to an April report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office. (Judge teams consist of an immigration judge, judicial law clerk, legal assistant, and three administrative support staff, according to the American Immigration Lawyers Association.) The Office of the Chief Immigration Judge within the U.S. Justice Department provides direction and sets priorities for the approximately 350 immigration judges located in about 60 immigration courts throughout the country, according to the Justice Department. James McHenry, director of the Executive Office for Immigration Review at the Justice Department, pegged the number of immigration judges at 334 in an April statement to a Senate committee. "The reference to ‘thousands’ of immigration judges is inaccurate," said Judge A. Ashley Tabaddor, president of the National Association of Immigration Judges. The Executive Office for Immigration Review has historically faced challenges filling positions due to a department-wide hiring freeze between January 2011 and February 2014, and to normal attrition, said Jeremy McKinney, secretary for the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Still, there are not thousands of immigration judges, he said, "not even close." Our ruling Speaking of immigration cases, Trump said, "We have thousands of judges." There are fewer than 400 immigration judges nationwide. The number of Article III federal judges is about 1,300. Even a combination of those numbers falls short of thousands.

pomt-11805	Under Scott Walker, "average wages, when adjusted for inflation, are lower today than they were under Jim Doyle."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/nov/17/matt-flynn/wages-under-scott-walker-less-under-jim-doyle-demo/	The day before Gov. Scott Walker made his re-election run official, Matt Flynn issued a pre-emptive strike, comparing the two-term Republican unfavorably to another two-term Wisconsin governor, Democrat Jim Doyle. "Scott Walker’s time is up," was how Flynn, a Democrat running in the 2018 race for governor, began his Nov. 4, 2017 news release. "Average wages, when adjusted for inflation, are lower today than they were under Jim Doyle." Walker, who has been governor since 2011, has used a number of economic statistics to argue that things are better than they were under Doyle, who served from 2003 through 2010. So, let’s see how the claim from Flynn, a lawyer and former chairman of the state Democratic Party, stands up. Under Walker, are average wages lower in Wisconsin than they were under Doyle? The claim alludes to Walker bearing some responsibility, but doesn’t directly blame him. And governors play an important but limited role in wages. Flynn’s evidence To back Flynn’s claim, his campaign cited two sets of statistics, both adjusted for inflation. 1. Under Walker in 2016, the median hourly wage was $17.43 -- 5 cents lower than in 2009 under Doyle, "before the full effects of the Great Recession set in." The figures are from the latest U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Occupational Employment Statistics, which are estimates based on data collected from employers in all industry sectors in Wisconsin. But Doyle served another full year. The figure for 2010 was $17.37 -- 6 cents lower than in 2016 under Walker. More importantly, the Bureau of Labor Statistics warns against using this particular set of data to make comparisons over time. So, we’re discounting this point. 2. The median hourly wage eclipsed $18 in 2003, 2005 and 2010 under Doyle -- but through 2016, had not reached that level under Walker. The figure in 2010, Doyle’s last full year in office, was $18.10, higher than the latest inflation-adjusted figure for Walker, $17.96 in 2016. That’s according to a 2017 report by COWS, formerly known as the Center on Wisconsin Strategy, at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The report cites statistics produced by the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. The Washington, D.C.-based institute says it used Current Population Survey data, produced jointly by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Census Bureau, that are good for comparisons over time. So, the second statistic tends to support Flynn’s claim -- although both statistics he cites are for median wages, rather than average. While average is the term Flynn used, many people use that word even when referring to median. Some economists recommend using the median, since it is a midpoint -- half of people earned wages below that point and half were above. In contrast, the average can be greatly influenced by extremes; for example, it will be pulled higher if there are many people earning very high incomes. Our numbers We produced our own inflation-adjusted numbers for average wages, the term Flynn used, with data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that can be used for comparisons over time. The average weekly wage in Wisconsin in 2016 was $885 -- higher than every year under Doyle -- according to the latest figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. The QCEW figures come from quarterly counts of employment and wages reported by employers covering more than 95 percent of U.S. jobs. By another measure, for only the private sector, the average weekly wage in August 2017 was $827 -- higher than the August figure for every year under Doyle dating back to 2007 -- according to the latest Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Current Employment Statistics figures. (Figures before 2007 are not available). So, the average wage under Walker is higher than when Doyle left office in 2010. Our rating Flynn says that under Walker, "average wages, when adjusted for inflation, are lower today than they were under Jim Doyle." Adjusting for inflation, the average wage is higher under Walker than it was when Doyle left office in 2010. But sometimes people use the more common term average when they’re actually referring to the median -- which some economists say is a better measure for wages because an average can be distorted by people who earn very high wages. The median wage was higher when Doyle left office than it is under Walker. Flynn’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details -- our definition of Half True.

pomt-11134	"We’ve been down this road before—blanket protectionism is a big part of why America had a Great Depression."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/31/ben-sasse/protectionism-big-part-great-depression-ben-sasse-/	Shortly after the Trump administration said it would slap tariffs on metals from the European Union, Canada and Mexico, Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., released a tersely worded statement on the looming "trade war." "This is dumb. Europe, Canada, and Mexico are not China, and you don’t treat allies the same way you treat opponents. We’ve been down this road before — blanket protectionism is a big part of why America had a Great Depression," Sasse's statement said. " 'Make America Great Again' shouldn’t mean 'Make America 1929 Again.' " Does Sasse have his history right when he says, "We’ve been down this road before — blanket protectionism is a big part of why America had a Great Depression"? He does, as we’ve recounted previously. The Smoot-Hawley tariffs If you’re a fan of the 1980s teen flick Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, you’ve already gotten a cheat sheet on what our research found. In a career-making scene, Ben Stein played a high school teacher explaining the causes of the Great Depression to a roomful of listless students. (It was actually a top-of-the-head riff by Stein, a trained economist.) Here’s the part that’s relevant to our fact-check (watch it here): "In 1930, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, in an effort to alleviate the effects of the... Anyone? Anyone?... the Great Depression, passed the... Anyone? Anyone? The tariff bill? The Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act? Which, anyone? Raised or lowered?... raised tariffs, in an effort to collect more revenue for the federal government. Did it work? Anyone? Anyone know the effects? It did not work, and the United States sank deeper into the Great Depression." Stein’s monologue pretty much tracks with what Sasse said: The United States imposed tariffs, they backfired, and the Depression got worse. Specifically, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 — sponsored by Sen. Reid Smoot, R-Utah, and Rep. Willis Hawley, R-Ore. — raised tariffs on manufactured foreign imports to 40 percent in some cases, the highest in U.S. history. It also extended tariff protection to some agricultural products. It was signed on June 17, 1930, or seven and a half months after Wall Street’s "Black Tuesday" on Oct. 29, 1929. The Smoot-Hawley tariffs, in turn, led other countries to retaliate with high tariffs of their own. Several economists and historians who studied the period told us the Stein-Sasse version of events is quite accurate. Expert opinions Douglas Irwin, a Dartmouth College economist and author of Peddling Protectionism: Smoot-Hawley and the Great Depression and Trade Policy Disaster: Lessons from the 1930s, said there was "no real reason" to impose the Smoot-Hawley tariffs, and that it was mainly done for "domestic political reasons." In fact, President Herbert Hoover is said to have signed the law only reluctantly and over the spirited objections of many economists. "Protectionism did not cause the Great Depression," Irwin said, but he added that it’s fair to say it made the depression "longer and more painful." After the tariffs were enacted, other countries, including Canada, retaliated against the United States by establishing a preferential trade bloc with Great Britain and other countries, thus hurting U.S. exports. "Other countries also used trade restrictions and protectionism as beggar-thy-neighbor policies to help their domestic economies during the worldwide slump," Irwin said. The problem, Irwin said, was that "if every country tries this strategy, everyone worse off since one country's imports are another country's exports. World trade reduced significantly, and since trade barriers are easy to impose and hard to relax, the problem festered for some time." Indeed, it took until 1933 for this downward spiral to ease. That’s when President Franklin D. Roosevelt -- a committed opponent of the Smoot-Hawley tariffs -- took office. As a side effect, the skirmishes over trade also frayed relations between former allies and may have contributed to the tensions that led to World War II, or at the very least complicated the Allies’ efforts to respond to the threat from Germany and Japan. This isn’t to say that there is unanimity among scholars about the precise role of Smoot-Hawley in worsening the Great Depression. "Economists today debate the tariffs’ effect on the Great Depression -- some feel it substantially worsened the downturn, while others think its negative effect was small," said Andrew Wender Cohen, a Syracuse University historian and author of Contraband: Smuggling and the Birth of the American Century. For instance, Robert S. McElvaine, a Millsaps College historian and author of The Great Depression: America 1929-1941, said the spotlighting of Smoot-Hawley has been articulated most aggressively by conservative, free-market advocates because it takes the focus off 1920s-era tax cuts and general income inequality during that decade. Still, McElvaine agreed that, even if the tariffs weren’t the biggest factor for prolonging the Great Depression, the tariffs did have an effect, and it was clearly negative. It’s also tricky to isolate causes of economic turmoil because they were tightly interwoven, experts said. "It's entirely possible that international trade would have dwindled even if government had not resorted to protectionism," said John E. Moser, an Ashland University historian and author of Global Great Depression and the Coming of World War II. "However, most economists agree that protectionism at the very least did not help, and likely prolonged the Depression." Our ruling Sasse said, "We’ve been down this road before — blanket protectionism is a big part of why America had a Great Depression." While the downturn that became the Great Depression had been under way for about half a year by the time the United States passed the Smoot-Hawley tariffs, economists agree that the resulting trade war worsened the impact on both the global and domestic economy. Sasse was cautious to say that the tariffs were "a big part" — rather than the only reason — for the Great Depression. So we rate his statement True.

pomt-05320	On signing a no-tax pledge	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/17/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-rejected-state-tax-pledge-signing-nati/	These days, it’s hard for candidates to claim they truly oppose taxes if they haven’t put it in writing. As a presidential candidate in 2012, Mitt Romney signed a pledge to forswear tax increases. In fact, in his official tax proposal, Romney has advocated across-the-board tax cuts. But has he been consistent over the years about putting his commitment not to raise taxes in the form of a pledge? The question about Romney and the tax pledge was raised in late 2007, when the Democratic National Committee released a 30-second ad and a four-minute video charging, among other things, that Romney had changed his position on signing a no-tax pledge. We checked the ad shortly after it came out. In this report, we’ll put that question to the Flip-O-Meter. We’ll start by noting that the Flip-O-Meter rates politicians' consistency on particular topics from No Flip to Full Flop. The meter is not intended to pass judgment on their decisions to change their minds. It’s simply gauging whether they did. Romney and the 2002 gubernatorial campaign During his 2002 campaign for governor of Massachusetts, Romney said he would not sign a pledge circulated by Citizens for Limited Taxation, a Massachusetts-based anti-tax group. Here’s how the Boston Globe covered the news: "In a break with Acting Governor Jane Swift and her GOP predecessors, Republican gubernatorial candidate Mitt Romney is refusing to rule out tax increases and said yesterday he will not sign a ‘no new taxes’ pledge," the newspaper wrote. "Romney said that while he opposes all tax increases in principle, he will not make such a pledge in writing." The article went on to quote Romney saying, "I am not in favor of increasing taxes. … At this stage, I am inclined to make that position as clear as I can but not to enter into a written pledge of some kind, and that's true on this and other issues." The Globe cited another comment by Romney that had been reported by the Union-News of Springfield, Mass. "I'm against tax increases," Romney told attendees of Western Massachusetts GOP meeting, according to the Union-News. "But I'm not intending to, at this stage, sign a document which would prevent me from being able to look specifically at the revenue needs of the Commonwealth." Barbara Anderson, an official with Citizens for Limited Taxation, was unhappy with Romney's refusal to sign, which came after he’d met with her for half an hour. "He's thinking like an independent businessman who doesn't sign pledges," she suggested to the Globe. Meanwhile, the Boston Herald quoted Eric Fehrnstrom, then Romney’s deputy campaign manager, saying, "Mitt Romney doesn't have to sign a piece of paper to have a position on an issue. He's pledged to oppose any tax increase, he doesn't support them, his position on taxes is clear." In an interview with the Globe, Fehrnstrom was even more dismissive, calling the pledge "government by gimmickry," the newspaper reported. Put it all together and you have a candidate who didn’t just decide against signing a pledge but who cast doubt on the propriety of such pledges in general. Romney’s decision on a pledge in late 2006 On Dec. 31, 2006, Romney became the first major candidate in the 2008 presidential election to sign a prominent taxpayer protection pledge offered by Americans for Tax Reform, an influential anti-tax group headed by Grover Norquist. "In signing the pledge, Gov. Romney firmly commits himself in writing to fiscal discipline and economic common sense," Norquist said in a news release. "Mitt Romney has told taxpayers in no uncertain terms that he plans to look out for their interests." Romney hardly signed the Norquist pledge covertly. On Jan. 4, 2007, he issued a press release touting his action, and on Oct. 5, 2007, he released a radio ad spotlighting it. "For years, conservative candidates for president signed their name on the dotted line pledging to oppose tax increases," Romney said in the ad. "I'm Mitt Romney. I'm proud to be the only major candidate for president to sign the tax pledge. The others have not. I signed the tax pledge because I want everyone to know where I stand. We've got to get taxes down and grow our economy." In this case, then, Romney not only signed a written pledge but actively broadcast it to the electorate. It’s worth noting that the two pledges are not exactly the same. One addressed the state context and one the federal context. The Massachusetts text was a "pledge to ... all the people of this state, that I will oppose and vote against any and all efforts to increase taxes." The Norquist pledge, to which Romney is still a signatory, requires the signer to "oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals and/or businesses … and oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates." Still, despite the differences in wording, we think the pledges are equivalent in their underlying requirements. Our ruling In 2002, Romney refused to make "a pledge in writing" on taxes. Four years later, he signed one and touted it as a selling point for his candidacy. In our book, that’s a Full Flop.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-05-17T16:51:18	2007-01-04	['None']
pomt-02555	"Eighty-five percent of the states in the United States that had electrocution have now abolished it."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2014/feb/03/scott-surovell/surovell-says-85-percent-states-have-stopped-using/	The possibility that Virginia will return to its electric chair to execute all condemned prisoners is shocking to Del. Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax. Since 1995, Virginia has given such prisoners a choice in their manner of death: lethal injection or electrocution. Seventy-nine inmates have died by injection; seven chose the chair. Drug manufacturers have stopped producing the products used to put people to death by lethal injection. Virginia’s supply ran out on Nov. 30. The House of Delegates, on a largely party-line vote on Jan. 22, passed a bill saying if drugs for the lethal injections are unavailable, electrocution will be used instead. Surovell led the Democratic debate against the bill, saying Virginia should seek a more humane form of capital punishment rather than return to the electric chair. "Eighty-five percent of the states in the United States that had electrocution have now abolished it," he said. We wondered if that statistic is accurate. Surovell sent us two articles to back his statement. One was a 1994 study by Deborah Denno, a law professor at Fordham University, which said that 26 states have used electrocution dating to the 19th century. Surovell also sent us a December 2012 article in Virginia Lawyer that cited Denno’s number of 26 states once allowing electrocutions, but added that all but four "have now moved away from it -- either by legislative abandonment or judicial ruling." That translates to an 85 percent drop in states. The four states that still allow electrocutions, the article said, are Virginia, Alabama, South Carolina and Florida. Two more -- Kentucky and Tennessee -- permit prisoners convicted only before 1998 and 1999, respectively, to select electrocution. The U.S. Department of Justice has different numbers, but they’re misleading. The department issued a report last July saying that as of 2011, the 36 states with capital punishment all allowed lethal injections. Eight of those states, DOJ said, also allowed for the possibility of electrocutions. Two of the states really don’t belong on the list, however, because their laws do not currently permit use of electric chairs. Arkansas allows any inmate convicted of a capital offense on or before July 4, 1983 to request death by electrocution. But there are no prisoners left on the state’s death row that qualify for the option. Oklahoma’s law "authorizes electrocution if lethal injection is held to be unconstitutional." That hasn’t happened. Our Ruling Surovell said, "85 percent of the states in the United States that had electrocution have now abolished it." Academic research shows 26 states have allowed electrocutions since the 19th century. A review of laws today shows that six states may still use their electric chairs at a condemned prisoner’s request. That means 77 percent of the states that had electrocutions have ended the practice. Surovell is right that states are shutting down their electric chairs, but his percentage is slightly off. We rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Scott Surovell	None	None	None	2014-02-03T10:40:01	2014-01-21	['United_States']
pomt-07115	Says tax revenue was lower than expected in May and "that's basically a clear indication the governor's counselors are probably right -- that we are still not out of the woods yet."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2011/jun/20/chris-widener/state-sen-chris-widener-says-may-tax-revenue-dip-s/	For the past year, the financial outlook for the state of Ohio has been on a gradual upswing marked by a dropping state unemployment rate and rising tax revenues that have outpaced expectations each month since June 2010. The rising financial tide has brought with it questions from reporters trying to sort out what and how much money the state may have left at the end of the fiscal year 2011 on June 30. And it has left Statehouse Republicans eager to tamp down on the speculation that there will be hundreds of millions in "extra money" lying around to potentially ease the burden of deep cuts made to state government, K-12 education and other areas of the state budget. That was the backdrop on the evening of June 7, just a few minutes after the Senate Finance Committee voted out the state budget, when Sen. Chris Widener, the committee's chairman, was asked about what the state might do with the "hundreds of millions" left in the bank in excess revenue for 2011. The Springfield Republican suggested that the state's economic recovery could nosedive at any moment and talked about sitting in on a meeting with a half-dozen financial experts on the governor's board of economic advisers who had "very disparaging reports" on the future of the American economy. Trying to hammer home his point that future revenue growth in the state is a shaky proposition, Widener referenced the state’s tax revenues for May, which had just been released. "You know the revenue estimates for the month of May? I think the (Senate) President (Niehaus) mentioned after session. We’re down for the month as compared to estimated revenue," he told reporters. "That's not a good sign. That's basically a clear indication the governor's counselors are probably right--that we are still not out of the woods yet. We're going month by month." Widener made a similar remark on June 15 during a public budget conference committee meeting. With tax revenues running above estimates for every month since June 2010, a poor showing in May could certainly be interpreted as an ominous sign. So PolitiFact Ohio decided to check if May's tax revenue was really down as Widener suggested, and if so, what could be the cause. We started with tax revenue data was released by the state budget office prior to Widener's statement. It showed May tax sources off by $3.8 million -- a negative 0.2 percent of all tax revenues. However, one of the best indications of the health of Ohio's economy relative to expectations -- personal income tax -- was $94 million above estimates. So what caused collections to come up short? It turns out domestic insurance tax, which Ohio insurance companies pay on the premiums they collect, was the guilty party. Revenue from that tax for May was 48 percent below estimates for the month, which adds up to a whopping $87 million, according to the revenue data. Dave Pagnard, a spokesman for the state budget office, said in an e-mail that the numbers for domestic insurance tax were off because of the timing of the mailings of the billings -- notices were sent too late in May for the payments to be received in time to count in the monthly numbers. He forwarded a 26-page Monthly Financial Report dated June 10, 2011 from state budget director Tim Keen to Gov. John Kasich that gives a detailed explanation about what happened with the domestic insurance shortfall. "This is primarily attributable to the loose billings and payment schedule for this tax as the Department of Insurance must certify the amount of billings to the Treasurer of State no later than the first Monday in May (May 2nd). The Treasurer of State then has up to 20 days after certification to send out the bills. Those billed then have 20 to 30 days after certification to submit payment," the report says. "As a result of this issue, the balance of the May billings (which totaled $195.5 million) will be received in June and thus June receipts for this tax should exceed the estimate by approximately the same amount of the May shortfall." Translation: It's a timing issue. The state of Ohio will pick the money up in June so the numbers aren't really off by $87 million -- only a temporarily accounting problem. In fact, had the domestic insurance revenue not been delayed, the state would have been $82.2 million in the black for the month of May. So how does Widener’s claim rate on the Truth-O-Meter? The Senate Finance chair offered up the failure of the state to hit its tax revenue marks in May as evidence that Ohio could be sliding back from a gradual recovery. And while it’s true that the state was under revenue estimates -- just barely -- it's a mirage based on the state's domestic insurance tax notices going out too late in May for most of them to be returned within the calendar month. While Widener was correct that May's tax revenues were slightly below estimates, he said it was "clear evidence" that Ohio is "not out of the woods yet" and could fall back into an economic decline. There’s room for debate on the progress of economic recovery in Ohio, but in this case the numbers were really nothing more than evidence of bureaucracy in state government. The lower than expected revenues were a result of timing, not depressed collections. That’s a critical fact. On the Truth-O-Meter, a statement that contains an element of truth but leaves out critical facts that would give listeners a different impression gets one rating: Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-03286	Says the 2014-15 state budget "cut border security and funding to fight criminal gangs."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/aug/02/dan-patrick/dan-patrick-says-2014-15-state-budget-cut-border-s/	In a video announcing his run for lieutenant governor June 27, 2013, state Sen. Dan Patrick said that border security is a federal responsibility but Texas’ problem, and the state shouldn’t budget less for it. "This year’s budget, despite increasing nearly 9 percent, actually cut border security and funding to fight criminal gangs," the Houston Republican said. "It was one of the reasons I voted against the budget." In a recent PolitiFact check, we found that state spending (aka general revenue) rose no more than 8.7 percent from 2012-13 to 2014-15. Did that include cuts to combating gangs and securing the border? Analysis showed us that wasn’t exactly so -- in fact, budgeted border spending rose about $118 million. Border security has been a fiscal priority for Gov. Rick Perry, who has urged state efforts to supplement federal border operations starting in 2005. In 2010, he said those efforts had decreased border crime 60 percent, a claim we rated as Pants on Fire largely because its basis was crime in rural areas only, excluding towns and cities. Texas’ border security efforts, according to an April 2013 issue brief from the Legislative Budget Board staff, began with state programs funded by federal grants in 2005-2007, followed by lawmakers signing off on $124 million in state spending from 2008-09 through 2012-13. State border operations are coordinated by the Governor's Office of Homeland Security within the Department of Public Safety, it said. The state created centers in the border area and Austin to gather intelligence, built a crime laboratory in Laredo, used software to map criminal activities in real time and coordinated federal, state, local and private law enforcement, the brief said, and also bought six aircraft, six patrol boats and 326 patrol vehicles. Patrick spokesman Logan Spence told us by email that Patrick’s claim referred to three specific categories of DPS spending in the biennial budget: "organized crime," "border security" and "local border security." Spence emailed us summaries from the budget board, which advises lawmakers on state funding issues, giving the amounts appropriated for those categories in the past two budgets sent to Gov. Perry. The summaries, from Sept. 7, 2011, and May 20, 2013, showed all-funds spending, meaning state plus federal and other funds: "Organized crime" -- $17.4 million drop, from $134.6 million to $117.2 million. "Border security" plus "local border security" -- $6.1 million drop, from $89 million to $82.9 million. DPS spokesman Tom Vinger told us via email that those changes were attributable to funds being moved to different areas within the department, plus "one-time big ticket items" under border spending and revised estimates for items such as federal grants in the "organized crime" spending. Spence had also sent us budget board summaries that wrapped in border operations conducted under Texas Parks and Wildlife and Trusteed Programs in the Governor’s Office. Those summaries, from May 2011 and June 2013, indicated that all-funds border security spending in those programs plus the DPS "border/"local border" categories went from $219.5 million in 2012-13 to $94.1 million in 2014-15 -- indicating a drop of $128.1 million. Then again, the June 2013 summary also said "additional funding is provided" to DPS for border security above the $94.1 million total. Including that unspecified spending, the budget allocates more than $100 million to border security operations not spelled out in those estimates, we heard from a chief budget-writer and the staff of the board that advises lawmakers on spending issues Budget board staff spokesman John Barton told us via phone that by July 15, 2013, the board had estimated a total for border spending in all parts of DPS’ budget: $331.2 million in the 2014-15 budget. That total suggests an increase of $118.3 million over the agency’s revised 2012-13 border security budget total of $212.9 million. Vinger confirmed the amounts in the July 15 estimate were budgeted for DPS, offering no further comment. For another legislative perspective, we contacted a spokesman for Senate Finance Committee chairman Sen. Tommy Williams, R-The Woodlands. Via email, Gary Scharrer asserted that as a committee member, Patrick would have known the wider scope of border spending and could have requested such numbers before his June campaign announcement. Scharrer said via email that according to Senate Finance Committee staff, border operations spending across all agencies in 2014-15 was $343.2 million, up $121.6 million from the previous budget. We weren’t able to learn what date that estimate was produced, but Scharrer said Patrick would have been aware that such spending was going into the budget. "He would have been in the loop on border security budget discussions," Scharrer said. Noting the Senate gave the budget act its final approval on May 25, Scharrer said, "The numbers were available" to Patrick. "Sen. Patrick could have checked with LBB or DPS for clarification – or verification – before going public. Many members fact-check ahead of time," Scharrer said, adding with a note of humor that they do so "to save themselves from PolitiFact sweeping in after them." As to budgeted money to battle criminal gangs, Barton told us DPS’s "organized crime" category was not the only state money spent to fight gangs. However, he said, the budget board did not have an estimate of such a 2014-15 total. Spence said he stood by the information he sent us. "People read those summaries and rely on those summaries as accurate data from the Legislative Budget Board," he said. Asked about the budget board staff’s July 15 estimate of $331.2 million border spending in DPS for 2014-15, Spence said, "I think there’s a disagreement about what is border security spending." Citing a couple of items mentioned in the July 15 estimate, Spence said, "A raise for troopers is not border security spending. Police academies and all those things... If the budget says ‘Border security spending is this,’ then members of the committee and members of the Senate are going to rely on that." Barton said all items in the estimate relate directly to border security. For instance, he said, the nearly $75 million in listed pay raises reflects money going to officers involved in border operations. Our ruling Patrick said the 2014-15 state budget written by lawmakers and signed into law by Perry "cut border security and funding to fight criminal gangs." Yet his cited figures drew from budget summaries that did not show all border spending. Budgeted border security funding in 2014-15 exceeds the total in the 2012-13 budget by about one third, while budgeted 2014-15 spending on battling gangs has yet to be fully calculated. It’s a PolitiFact principle not to hold people responsible for information that wasn’t available when they made their claims. In this instance, though, our sense is Patrick could at least have pinned down total border security funding before he spoke. The fact that anti-gang spending has still not been totaled leaves Patrick’s claim with a possible element of truth. We rate the full statement as Mostly False.

pomt-09849	The health care reform plan being proposed in Congress would mean "big tax increases."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/14/us-chamber-commerce/us-chamber-commerce-ad-says-health-reform-plan-wou/	The Campaign for Responsible Health Reform, sponsored by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, released a 30-second TV commercial that warns the health plans kicking around in Congress will translate to "big tax increases." With the visual of a red balloon expanding until it pops, the announcer says: "Washington's latest health reform idea: a trillion-dollar health plan, and a government-run public option, with big tax increases, even on health benefits. And the federal deficit? The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says the deficit will grow $239 billion. Inflated taxes. Swelling deficits. And expanded government control over your health. Tell Congress, 'Let's slow down and reform health care the right way.'" There's no denying the health care plans being considered in Congress would be expensive. In order to meet the plan's goal of reducing the number of uninsured, the government would be providing more in health care subsidies. That costs money. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the plan would cost in the neighborhood of $1 trillion over 10 years. But would it mean "big tax increases, even on health benefits?" The answer: It depends. There is not a single health care plan, there are several versions kicking around various committees in the House and Senate. And they have different approaches on how the plan would be paid for. Most of the discussion has focused on the the House plans because there is not a detailed Senate version yet. In the House plan, the tax increases are targeted at the wealthy. So if you make $1 million a year, yes, the plan would mean a big tax increase. We can be even more precise. The House versions of the bill would help pay for the health plan with a surtax on high earners that would break down as follows: for couples making between $350,000 and $500,000 (or $280,000 to $400,000 for individuals), a new 1 percent tax; between $500,000 and $1 million ($400,000 to $800,000 for individuals), 1.5 percent; and over $1 million (or over $800,000 for individuals), 5.4 percent. In other words, a family making $1 million would have to pay $9,000. Small businesses filing as individuals would face the same levies at those income levels. In all, that is estimated to bring in about $540 billion over 10 years. "That hits the very top earners," said Bob Williams of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. "But that proposal would not affect many people." In fact, he said, less than 2 percent of the population fall into those income categories. But according to the Chamber, the high earners aren't the only ones who will see tax increases. In the House versions of the health plan, there's a tax penalty — anywhere from 2 percent to 8 percent on payroll taxes — for large companies that do not provide government-approved health care plans. There's also a tax penalty on uninsured people who refuse to buy insurance (that's the incentive to get everyone on some health plan). As for the Chamber of Commerce claim that the plans would even include taxes on health benefits, you need to go to the Senate side for that discussion. Although there's nothing currently in writing in a bill, the Senate Finance Committee is mulling a tax on so-called "Cadillac" or "gold-plated" health plans, plans that cost well above average. Essentially it would tax any amount paid for insurance plans over a certain threshold — perhaps $8,000 for an individual, or $21,000 for a family, said James Galfand, senior manager of health policy for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. While it would not directly tax employees' health benefits, he said, it would amount to the same thing, as those costs would be passed on by the insurance company or employer. We think the Chamber of Commerce ad is a bit premature in warning that the health plan would include taxes on health benefits. It might, but so far, that's not in any published version of the bill, and the House specifically did not include it in its plan. The Chamber of Commerce ad does raise some legitimate concerns about how the health care plan would be paid for. But we think it's slightly misleading to say it would lead to "big tax increases." That's true for some high earners. But it's not true for the vast majority of people who do not make that level of income. Uninsured people who decline to purchase insurance will see a tax hit, but that's also expected to be a small minority. Things may change as these bills seek to solve the question of paying for the plan, but as the plans are now, some people would see a big tax increase, but most would not. That leaves us at a Half True.	None	U.S. Chamber of Commerce	None	None	None	2009-08-14T18:29:22	2009-08-12	['United_States_Congress']
pomt-14388	"The fact is voter fraud is rampant."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2016/mar/17/greg-abbott/light-match-greg-abbotts-claim-about-rampant-voter/	Greg Abbott took exception to President Barack Obama’s pokes about voter turnout and the governor followed up with a claim that, if supported, would arguably justify Texas Rangers manning polling stations. Obama, kicking off the South by Southwest Interactive conference March 11, 2016, told Evan Smith, CEO of the Texas Tribune, that the U.S. is the world’s only advanced democracy that "makes it harder for people to vote," perhaps referring to voter registration hurdles or the mandate in dozens of states, including Texas, that voters present a photo ID before casting a ballot (he didn’t specify). Obama otherwise called it important for conference participants to study ways of redesigning "our systems" to step up voter turnout. Then the Democratic leader said, to laughter, "the folks who are currently governing the good state of Texas aren’t interested in having more people participate." Abbott, a Republican, told reporters three days later: "To the contrary of the president’s comment, the… fact is, despite our voter registration laws, we had the highest level of turnout than ever before in the primary that occurred just a few weeks before he made that comment." We’re separately checking his turnout tout. Abbott, the former longtime state attorney general, went on: "The fact is voter fraud is rampant--and in Texas, unlike some other states and unlike some other leaders, we are committed to cracking down on voter fraud." Rampant fraud? We wondered, especially because we’ve looked into identified instances, finding them rare. Abbott offers no backup Abbott didn’t respond to our request for elaboration. So we don’t know the basis of his "rampant" claim. But generally, the prevalence of voter fraud has widely been doubted. In 2013, for instance, a chart provided by then-AG Abbott showed 18 convictions, no-contest pleas or guilty pleas on voter fraud charges from 2002 through 2012. That’s not a lot of fire but it was sufficient for us to find False a Democrat’s claim that studies had shown voter fraud to be non-existent in Texas. No surge, state records suggest After Abbott disagreed with Obama, we asked the Texas attorney general’s office for its latest breakdowns. Could there have been a fresh surge in fraud? Not according to the state documents, updated through February 2016. But we did learn of the 2015 case of Rosa Maria Ortega, charged with illegally voting in 2012 and 2014. A Tarrant County grand jury indicted Ortega for illegally voting in five Dallas County elections dating from 2005 through May 2014, according to a Nov. 9, 2015, Dallas Morning News account. The story said she’d allegedly registered to vote by swearing incorrectly that she was a citizen and it quoted Sharen Wilson, the Tarrant County criminal district attorney, saying: "This is a big deal. People insist this kind of thing doesn’t happen, but it’s happening right here at home." According to the state's updated information, about 20 voting-related referrals to local prosecutors have occurred since 2014 including a few "illegal voting" matters such as the Ortega case. A conservative compendium Nationally, the conservative Heritage Foundation in 2015 posted a state-by-state breakdown of voter and election fraud convictions. Its Texas section walks through convictions reached against a dozen Texas residents from 2006 through 2015 for schemes ranging from vote-buying to impersonation fraud at the polls to, in a 2012 instance, trying to register to vote despite lacking citizenship. In 2015, most recently, Francisco "Frankie" Garcia, Rebecca Gonzalez, Diana Balderas Castaneda, and Guadalupe Escamilla were convicted of trying to buy votes in a Donna school board race with cocaine, cash, beer and cigarettes, the foundation says, with all four pleading guilty. Also in 2015, Hazel Woodard of Fort Worth pleaded guilty to impersonation fraud; Woodard had been a candidate for Democratic precinct chair who had her teenage son vote for her husband at the polls out of concern the elder Woodard wouldn’t make it to the polls, the foundation says. The gig was up, according to the foundation, after the dad showed up to vote after all. More rare than a lightning strike? Other resources indicate there’s not much there there. In 2012, the News21 investigative project headquartered at Arizona State University’s journalism school compiled a database that showed 104 Texas cases of alleged election fraud among 2,068 nationwide since 2000. The News21 students, who published their results Aug. 12, 2012, gathered allegations through public information requests, news accounts and court records. According to the project’s website, the students included all cases "that had reached some level of official action: That is, someone was charged, an investigation was opened, a specific accusation was made against a named person." All told, News21 determined that 37 of the 104 Texas allegations were made against voters. Most of the cases were still pending at the time the students published their project in 2012, but 15 had resulted in a guilty plea or conviction, according to the database. A follow-up PolitiFact fact check, posted in August 2015, found that in Texas since 2002, there had been 85 election fraud prosecutions, not all resulting in convictions. Some perspective: From 2000 to 2014, per the Texas Secretary of State’s online record, about 72 million ballots were cast in Texas (and that’s not counting municipal and other local-only elections). In 2015, Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, said most of the Texas prosecutions would not have been prevented by the voter ID law. "There were a bunch of prosecutions for unlawfully turning in a ballot that people weren't supposed to have possession. There are a few instances of marking someone else's ballot without their consent — those are all absentee ballots. There are a few of fake registration, or of voting while ineligible — none of which are stopped by a rule requiring ID at the polls," Levitt said. "There are vanishingly few instances of voter fraud — incidents flat-out, not just prosecutions — that could be stopped by applying a rule requiring ID at the polls." Also in 2015, Lorraine Minnite, a Rutgers University political scientist professor who has testified as an expert on behalf of plaintiffs challenging the Texas voter ID law, pointed out 2012 court testimony by Major Forrest Mitchell, a criminal investigator with the Texas Attorney General’s office, in which Mitchell admitted that only about five of the more than 300 election fraud referrals that had been investigated since 2002 dealt with in-person voter impersonation. Mitchell’s testimony indicated that two of the cases could have been prevented by a voter ID law. Three people were prosecuted, though, since one case involved two people. According to an August 2014 analysis posted by the Washington Post, Levitt found only three credible allegations of fraud in Texas elections since 2000 which the state’s Republican-brought voter ID law was crafted to prevent. Separately, Minnite found four cases of this kind from 2000 until 2014. Four cases of fraud for 72 million votes cast suggests the incidence of Texas voter fraud was about 1 in 18 million. Plaintiff’s lawyer: ‘Not rampant’ While we didn’t hear more from Abbott, we did reach Jennifer Clark, a voting-rights lawyer for the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, which represents the Texas State Conference of the NAACP and the state’s Mexican American Legislative Caucus in an ongoing lawsuit challenging the Texas voter ID law. By phone, Clark told us that "under no definition of rampant is voter fraud rampant in Texas and the United States," though, she said, "that doesn’t mean it doesn’t happen." Our ruling Abbott, defending the Texas mandate to present a photo ID at the polls, said: "Voter fraud is rampant." If Abbott has the goods on this, he’s keeping secrets. Best we can tell, in-person voter fraud--the kind targeted by the ID law--remains extremely rare, which makes this claim incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

pomt-06750	"When Social Security first started, there was 16 workers for every retiree. Today there are three workers for every retiree and soon there will be only two for every retiree."	true	/florida/statements/2011/aug/24/marco-rubio/reagan-library-speech-marco-rubio-takes-social-sec/	Freshman U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., gave a highly anticipated and hyped address at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library on Aug. 23, 2011, where Rubio continued his call for a smaller, fundamentally different and more conservative federal government. Rubio was invited to speak at the library at the personal invitation of former First Lady Nancy Reagan, and Rubio entered the library to deliver his remarks with her on his arm. He joked it was just the second person he'd walked down the aisle with -- the first being his wife Jeanette. (Rubio also helped Reagan up when she stumbled.) He addressed the crowd for more than 20 minutes, talking about his Cuban-immigrant roots, his experience coming of age during the presidency of Ronald Reagan, his belief in the American free enterprise system and his conviction that America can be both a prosperous and compassionate nation, according to the Los Angeles Times. Rubio also argued how both Democrats and Republicans created programs and levels of spending that -- while well intentioned -- were doomed to fail from the start. "You see, almost in forever, it was institutions and society that assumed the role of taking care of one another. If someone was sick in your family, you took care of them. If a neighbor met misfortune, you took care of them. You saved for your retirement and your future because you had to. "We took these things upon ourselves and our communities and our families and our homes and our churches and our synagogues. But all that changed when the government began to assume those responsibilities. All of the sudden, for an increasing number of people in our nation, it was no longer necessary to worry about saving for security because that was the government's job. "For those who met misfortune, that wasn't our obligation to take care of them, that was the government's job. And as government crowded out the institutions in our society that did these things traditionally, it weakened our people in a way that undermined our ability to maintain our prosperity. "The other thing is that we built a government and its programs without any account whatsoever for how we were going to pay for it. There was not thought given into how this was going to be sustained. When Social Security first started, there was 16 workers for every retiree. Today there are only three for every retiree and soon there will only be two for every retiree. "Program after program was crafted without any thought as to how they will be funded in future years or the impact it would have on future Americans. They were done with the best of intentions, but because it weakened our people and didn't take account the simple math of not being able to spend more money than you have, it was destined to fail and brought us to the point at which we are at today." Rubio is suggesting that pre-government intervention with the creation of programs like Social Security and Medicare and welfare, people and private groups provided the same support. We're not going to attempt to check that fact, though we should note we're not necessarily agreeing to that point. According to the Social Security Administration, only about 15 percent of the labor force had any type of pension plan in 1932 and only about 5 percent of laborers actually received retirement benefits. During the height of the Great Depression over half of the elderly in America lacked sufficient income to be self-supporting, the federal government said. That out of the way, we wanted to check Rubio's example of the Social Security system, that the number of workers per retiree has dwindled from 16 to 1 when the program started to almost 2 to 1 today. Our colleagues at PolitiFact Georgia examined a similar claim made by U.S. Sen Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia. Experts they talked to said the best information comes from the Social Security Administration, the federal agency that administers the program. Social Security was created in 1935 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt as part of his New Deal. The program has been amended several times over the years, which makes an apples-to-apples comparison somewhat problematic. But on regurgitating the data, Rubio is largely correct. The first set of Social Security Administration data comparing the ratio of workers to retirees comes from 1945 (the first benefits were not paid out until 1940). In 1945, there were almost 42 workers per retiree. In 1950, after changes to the program expanded coverage to an additional 10 million Americans and improved benefits, there were 16.5 workers for each Social Security recipient. That's the number Rubio is citing and is supported by experts. By 2011, the worker-to-retiree ratio had dropped to 2.9 to 1. The ratio is projected to continue to shrink, to 2.4 workers per retiree in 2022 and 2.2 workers per retiree in 2027. We should note the workers-per-retiree figure shrunk quickly following 1950. By 1955, the ratio was down to 8.6 workers per retiree. By 1965, the ratio was 4 workers per retiree. None of that speaks counter to Rubio's statement. In some ways, it illustrates the main problem with Social Security -- more and more money is going out in benefits and less and less money is coming in through payroll taxes. Rubio said, "When Social Security first started, there were 16 workers for every retiree. Today there are three workers for every retiree and soon there will be only two for every retiree." The official numbers from the Social Security Administration back him up. We rate this claim True.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2011-08-24T15:59:17	2011-08-23	['None']
pomt-04243	Says that under the new healthcare law, full- and part-time workers will be required to buy insurance costing $375 to $1,000 a month, starting in 2014.	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/nov/18/county-line/county-line-restaurant-chain-says-full-and-part-ti/	Just before the November 2012 elections, employees of an Austin-based restaurant chain were warned the 2010 federal health care overhaul will cost them. An open letter; headlined "Health Insurance -- Starting in 2014," was tucked in with paychecks for employees of the County Line restaurants, according to an Austin Chronicle news article posted online Nov. 2. As of January 2014, the letter says, "YOU will be required to get and pay for health insurance. Your employer may help you but YOU will be legally required to buy health insurance." The letter continues: "How much will I have to pay? The best estimate from the Congressional Budget Office for the minimum level of health insurance coverage" when the law takes effect is $4,500 a year, or $375 a month, for individual coverage, and $12,000 a year, or $1,000 a month, for family coverage. Reader Sally Villarreal of Austin wrote us asking if the declared costs hold water. Under the law, many Americans will be required to have coverage as of 2014 or pay an income-tax penalty. But not every resident will directly pay the full costs. The law provides tax credits subsidizing purchases by people with lower incomes. Also, many full-time workers will not face the full tab. The County Line letter, for instance, says employees considered full time, or working more than 30 hours a week, would have half their individual premium costs covered by the chain. Under the law, businesses with 50 or more full-time employees must offer those employees an affordable plan or pay a penalty for not doing so. The letter does not say if the chain plans to offer part-time workers health-plan help, though it says such workers will have to get insured, regardless. As a result of the law, the letter says, "many of our employees will be restricted to working less than 30 hours a week." By telephone, Glen Garey, general counsel of the Texas Restaurant Association, who said he reviewed the letter before its distribution, told us he expects the law to cause restaurants to strive for a lid on full-time workers. The letter closes: "THIS IS THE LAW. It’s not a maybe. It is already happening." After noting that the Supreme Court has upheld the insurance mandate, the letter says: "The law could be repealed, but that would require a Republican president, and Republican majorities in the Senate and House... At this point, ‘Hope’ is not a strategy." That portion could have been read as a timely appeal to vote against President Barack Obama and Democrats who supported the law, which is often called Obamacare. Not so, County Line co-owner Skeeter Miller told us by telephone. Miller said the County Line, whose restaurants employ up to 1,000 people each year, distributed the notice because some workers incorrectly believed they were going to be getting free health care. So, will premiums cost $350 to $1,000 a month as the County Line says? Miller said he based the employee notice on a Jan. 11, 2010, letter from Douglas Elmendorf, director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, to Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, who had requested information on likely premiums for policies fulfilling the requirement that Americans get insured. The budget office letter says the agency’s cost estimates — for 2016, not 2014 — address Snowe’s question about the likely costs to obtain what are designated as minimal "Bronze" health plans, as opposed to more costly "Silver" plans providing greater coverage. "Overall, CBO estimates that premiums for Bronze plans purchased individually in 2016 would probably average between $4,500 and $5,000 for single policies and between $12,000 and $12,500 for family policies," Elmendorf wrote. Sure enough, those figures boil out to monthly costs of $375 to $417 for single policies and $1,000 to $1,042 for family policies, close to what the County Line told its workers. But the budget office figures were laid out with caveats, including that they do not reflect the subsidies available to lower-income Americans, the budget office letter says, and also "represent national averages; premiums for specific individuals would differ on the basis of their age, average spending on health care in their area of the country, and the specific plan they chose." By email, budget office spokeswoman Deborah Kilroe advised us the figures have not been updated. Separately, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas, a health insurer, replied to our inquiries about the expected costs of coverage without specific forecasts. Blue Cross spokesman Ross Blackstone said by email: "We don't forecast costs like that because there are just too many variables that determine a person's premiums (type of policy, geographic region, utilization in that area, state reporting requirements, etc.)." For an insurance industry perspective, Jennifer Cawley of the Texas Association of Life and Health Insurers guided us to Robert Zirkelbach of the America’s Health Insurance Plans, a national trade association representing the health insurance industry. By telephone, Zirkelbach said the 2010 estimate remains the best available national forecast, but averages also don’t tell the full story. He said several factors--including the law’s minimum coverage requirement--to drive up premiums. "How much an individual or small business’s premiums will go up depends entirely on the amount of coverage someone has today," Zirkelbach said, meaning that if current coverage is especially minimal, the 2014 increase will likely be more substantial. Another variable, he said, would be the number of beneficiaries placed under each policy. Next, we noticed the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, which has widely studied U.S. health care, cites the budget office figures on its web page outlining the law’s mandate. Kaiser’s summary says premiums would vary by the age of people being insured. In 2010, it says, employees paid $899 on average toward the cost of individual coverage in an employer-based insurance plan and $3,997 for a family of four. That’s a lot less than the budget office cost estimates for 2016, but also solely reflects employee shares of premiums. Meantime, premium costs have gone up. According to a 2012 Kaiser survey of employer health benefits, annual premiums for family coverage cost $15,745 of late, with workers on average paying $4,316 toward those costs. Premiums for worker-only health coverage reached $5,615 annually, Kaiser said, with workers on average paying $951. Kaiser said the survey was conducted between January and May 2012 and included 3,326 randomly selected, non-federal public and private firms with three or more employees, 2,121 of which responded to the full survey. We asked Kaiser’s Gary Claxton, who oversaw the survey, to speak to the cost claim in the County Line’s notice. By telephone, Claxton suggested several flaws, including, he said, the implication that workers would be burdened with the full premium costs whereas employers would partially fund costs for full-time workers. Also, Claxton said, part-time workers might qualify for subsidies. Either way, he said, "the employee is not paying the whole thing." Carter Hobbs, a County Line employee who helped draft the employee notice, agreed by phone that the 2010 projections reflect full premium costs, not costs to employees alone. "How that cost is covered is a whole ‘nother discussion," Hobbs said. Our ruling The County Line letter to workers says full- and part-time workers will be required to buy health insurance in 2014 costing $375 to $1,000 a month. Those figures align with the budget office’s 2010 letter on what it would cost to purchase health insurance in 2016--not 2014. Also, those estimates did not attempt to calculate the effect of premium subsidies and were clearly presented as ballpark forecasts. Broadly, too, the County Line notice risks the misimpression that insurance costs would be borne by workers alone when results will not be that simple. We rate this claim as Half True.

pomt-12141	"There's no such thing as a lone wolf. ... That was a phrase invented by the last administration to make Americans stupid."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/aug/10/sebastian-gorka/no-obama-administration-didnt-invent-term-lone-wol/	Sebastian Gorka, a deputy assistant to President Donald Trump, is none too fond of the terrorism-fighting approach of former President Barack Obama. He made this clear during an Aug. 8 interview on MSNBC. "There's no such thing as a lone wolf," Gorka said. "You do know that. That was a phrase invented by the last administration to make Americans stupid. There has never been a serious attack or a serious plot that was unconnected from ISIS or al-Qaida. At least through the ideology and the TTPs, the tactics, the training, the techniques and the procedures, that they supply through the internet. Never happened. It’s bogus." However, Gorka’s assertions are flawed, several terrorism experts told PolitiFact. (The White House did not provide any additional explanation in response to an inquiry.) The lone wolf as a metaphor for independent terrorism clearly pre-dated the Obama administration. We’ll also note that Gorka’s claim that there has "never" been a serious plot unconnected from ISIS or al-Qaida is dubious. The term lone wolf 'was a phrase invented by the last administration' This is easily debunked. Just look at a few of the books that used the term in the context of terrorism before Obama took office in January 2009: • Brian T. Bennett, Understanding, Assessing, and Responding to Terrorism: Protecting Critical Infrastructure and Personnel, 2007: "Lone wolf terrorism involves individual extremists who usually operate alone or on the fringes of established extremist groups, inflicting serious harm or causing significant damage." • Jeffrey F. Addicott, Winning the War on Terror: Legal and Policy Lessons from the Past, 2002: "Because they operate on their own, without affiliation to any known group or state, individuals who engage in ‘lone-wolf terrorism’ are far harder to predict, track, or deter." • Linda Jacobs Altman, Hate and Racist Groups: A Hot Issue, 2001: "The lone wolf and leaderless cell became part of the new face of racist terrorism in the 1990s." In addition, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 amended the definition of an "agent of a foreign power" to include a "lone wolf" category. The provision was widely known as the "lone wolf" amendment. So, how far back does the term go? Experts said that its specific application to terrorism originated with the ideas of white nationalist Louis Beam, who in the early 1980s advocated "leaderless resistance." Tom Metzger, the founder of the group White Aryan Resistance, advocated a similar approach. The idea "was adopted by American right-wing extremists in response to a federal law enforcement crackdown on domestic terrorists during the 1980s," said Mark Hamm, an Indiana State University criminologist who coauthored the book The Age of Lone Wolf Terrorism. "Leaderless resistance is based on the idea that a terrorist group, no matter how secret or well-organized, simply cannot evade law enforcement, so terrorism is more readily accomplished by individual actors rather than a group." In 1998, FBI agents in San Diego opened "Operation Lone Wolf" -- an investigation into the criminal activities of a self-proclaimed white supremacist, Alex Curtis. The following year, a widely noted New York Times article was headlined, "New Face of Terror Crimes: 'Lone Wolf' Weaned on Hate." Over the next few years, the term became increasingly associated with terrorism of all stripes and was used by government officials, academics, and the media. "The reason was obvious: There were numerous sporadic terrorist attacks carried out by individuals and small groups," said George Michael, a criminologist at Westfield State University and author of Lone Wolf Terror and the Rise of Leaderless Resistance. "Furthermore, many of the perpetrators had little or no connections to terrorist movements." So while the term "lone wolf" was used increasingly during Obama’s presidency, its application to terrorism was already decades old, and it was not "invented" by the administration. 'There has never been a serious attack or a serious plot that was unconnected from ISIS or al-Qaida' Analyzing this statement requires a bit more nuance, so we won’t factor it into our rating. But the claim is still problematic, experts said. On the most basic level, there have been countless of terrorist attacks that have nothing to do with Islamic radicalism -- starting with the white nationalist movements that helped promulgate the term "lone wolf" in the first place. Other examples of terrorism, stemming from a variety of motives, include the 16 lethal bombings by Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski between 1978 and 1995, the Oklahoma City bombing by Timothy McVeigh in 1995, and the series of bombings by Olympic Games bomber Eric Rudolph between 1996 and 1998. Meanwhile, across the globe, "there are a range of attacks by lone perpetrators that are tied to ethnic rather than religious causes, and not all were Islamic by a long shot," said Jeffrey Kaplan, a terrorism specialist who is starting a posting at King Fahd Defense College in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and who co-authored the book, Lone Wolf and Autonomous Cell Terrorism. Even limiting the universe to post 9/11 attacks with Muslim perpetrators produces some exceptions to Gorka’s firm "never," said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. He cited two attacks without apparent links to al-Qaida or ISIS: • On July 4, 2002, Hesham Mohamed Hadayet opened fire at Los Angeles International Airport, killing two and injuring four. Hadayet, a 41-year-old Egyptian national, died after being shot by an airport security guard. The FBI concluded that Hadayet’s killing spree was a terrorist act, but that he acted alone and hoped to influence U.S. government policy toward Palestine. • On July 28, 2006, Naveed Afzal Haq killed one woman and injured five others at the Jewish Federation of Greater Seattle. A witness told the Associated Press that Haq declared himself "a Muslim American, angry at Israel" before opening fire. FBI officials said he was not acting part of a terrorist group, but "acting out some kind of antagonism toward this particular organization." The attack was ultimately classified as a hate crime by the county prosecutor. Gartenstein-Ross said he’s sympathetic to Gorka’s broader skepticism about the impact of lone wolves. For starters, there is evidence from a recent University of Miami study that online pro-ISIS groups have highly fluid memberships, suggesting that true lone wolves -- people acting genuinely on their own without any interactions with like-minded individuals, online or otherwise -- are rare in the Internet age. Experts have cautioned that overuse of the term "lone wolf" may even be hampering investigations. "When you systematically describe attackers as lone wolves, you sometimes end up missing the networks they were connected to," Gartenstein-Ross said. Our ruling Gorka said, "There's no such thing as a lone wolf. ... That was a phrase invented by the last administration to make Americans stupid." Contrary to what Gorka said, the concept of the lone wolf terrorist predates the Obama administration by decades. We found the term widely used by government officials, academics, and the media, all before Obama took office. We rate the statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-05180	When Mitt Romney was governor, Massachusetts lost 40,000 manufacturing jobs, a rate twice the national average, and fell to 47th in job creation, fourth from the bottom.	half-true	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/jun/14/barack-obama/obama-attacks-romney-over-40000-lost-manufacturing/	In the presidential campaign, the TV ads have been a battle of numbers. The latest come from President Barack Obama, who highlighted Mitt Romney’s job record in a advertisement airing in New Hampshire and around the country titled, "We’ve heard it all before." "When Mitt Romney was governor, Massachusetts lost 40,000 manufacturing jobs, a rate twice the national average, and fell to 47th in job creation, fourth from the bottom," Obama claims. PolitiFact has addressed both parts before and rated them both Half True. In checking Obama’s claim about manufacturing jobs under Romney, PolitiFact National turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the government’s official source of employment data, and examined state-level, seasonally adjusted data for manufacturing jobs during Romney’s tenure -- from January 2003 to January 2007. Over that period, Massachusetts manufacturing jobs declined from 336,000 to 298,200 -- a difference of 38,000 jobs. So It’s not 40,000, but it’s close. As for the second part of the claim -- the rate of decrease -- Massachusetts manufacturing jobs fell by 11.3 percent over the four-year period. The drop for the nation was 5.8 percent. That means the Massachusetts decline was nearly twice that of the nation, as the ad claimed. So the Obama campaign is right about the manufacturing jobs numbers. But it's worth pointing out that the numbers before and after Romney’s term reveal that the manufacturing job loss under Romney (11.3 percent) was slower than it was in either the previous four-year period (16.7 percent) or the successive four-year period (15.1 percent). This weakens the Obama campaign’s argument. As for the part about job creation, Obama adviser David Axelrod recently threw out the same "47th-in-job-creation" claim on CBS’ "Face the Nation" and scored a Half True on the Truth-O-Meter. PolitiFact National used state-level statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, looking at figures for non-farm jobs, seasonally adjusted. Since the Massachusetts governor takes office in early January, PolitiFact used the data for December of each year as a baseline. From December 2002 to December 2006, Massachusetts ranked 47th out of 50 states (not including the District of Columbia) in job growth, calculated by using the number of jobs at the beginning and end of the period for each state to determine the percentage change and then ranking the states. Only Ohio, Louisiana and Michigan fared worse. So, the numbers check out again. But in rating claims like these, PolitiFact also interviews experts about how much the target of the attack deserves blame for the numbers. And quite often, experts say it's a stretch to blame a governor for the complex things that happen in a state economy. "Presidents, governors, and mayors can have an impact on job creation during their terms in office," said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. "Almost always, however, the impact is small in relation to the effects of events and trends over which elected officials have little control, especially in their first few years on the job. A recession that is underway or begins soon after a president or governor takes office is in no way the fault of the new officeholder. "The flip side is that chief executives cannot claim much credit for a strong economic recovery that begins shortly before or after they take the oath of office. The conditions that made the recovery possible were already present when their term in office began. The executive’s policies may have speeded or slowed the recovery around the margins, but the conditions that caused the recovery to begin were already present before the oath of office was administered." (PolitiFact has noted that Burtless contributed $750 to Obama’s campaign in 2011. However, in 2008 he provided advice on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and he has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties.) There are lots of ways to present jobs data. And the statistics can often be manipulated so that competing campaigns can make equal and opposite conclusions. The Romney campaign also has put its own twist on jobs creation data, pointing to figures that show Massachusetts' percentage of job growth improving from 49th out of 50 during 2003 to 36th during 2006. The campaign has noted that Massachusetts added more than 47,000 jobs over the course of his administration--a gross number that fails to factor in job losses during Romney’s time as governor. Our ruling Obama used accurate figures for the number and rate of manufacturing job losses in Massachusetts under Romney. He also gives the correct ranking for Massachusetts’ job creation during Romney’s tenure. But Obama exaggerated Romney’s impact on the Bay State job market, an impact that experts stress is minor at best. Also, it's important to note that the the manufacturing job loss under Romney (11.3 percent) was slower than it was in either the previous four-year period (16.7 percent) or the successive four-year period (15.1 percent). This weakens the Obama campaign’s argument. So just as PolitiFact did with the individual claims, we rate this version Half True.

pomt-13491	Says Donald Trump is "on record extensively supporting (the) intervention in Libya."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/07/hillary-clinton/clinton-says-trump-supported-intervention-libya/	When it comes to national security, Republican Donald Trump casts Democrat Hillary Clinton as too ready to take the country into war. One of his prime examples -- Clinton’s full-throated support for the attacks that toppled Libyan dictator Muammar Gadhafi. But in a NBC News forum focused on the role of the commander-in-chief, Clinton deflected that criticism. She said there was no difference between herself and Trump on the Libyan action. "He's on record extensively supporting intervention in Libya, when Gadhafi was threatening to massacre his population," Clinton said Sept. 7, 2016. Did Trump endorse the attacks to unseat Libya’s then-leader, Moammar Gadhafi? The record shows he did. Early in 2011, before the United States joined a NATO force to oust Gadhafi, Trump argued for American action. We know what Trump thought back then thanks to a video on Trump’s own video blog (credit to BuzzFeed for spotting it) "I can’t believe what our country is doing," Trump said, according to the BuzzFeed transcript. "Gadhafi in Libya is killing thousands of people, nobody knows how bad it is, and we’re sitting around. We have soldiers all over the Middle East, and we’re not bringing them in to stop this horrible carnage and that’s what it is: It’s a carnage." Trump continued. "You talk about things that have happened in history; this could be one of the worst," he said. "Now we should go in, we should stop this guy, which would be very easy and very quick. We could do it surgically, stop him from doing it, and save these lives. This is absolutely nuts. We don’t want to get involved and you’re gonna end up with something like you’ve never seen before." And then ... "But we have go in to save these lives; these people are being slaughtered like animals," Trump said. "It’s horrible what’s going on; it has to be stopped. We should do on a humanitarian basis, immediately go into Libya, knock this guy out very quickly, very surgically, very effectively, and save the lives." Trump offered a more mixed assessment on CNN after the attacks began. His primary concern was with the political leanings of the forces opposing Gadhafi. "I do really want to know who these people we're fighting for, who they are," Trump said on March 28, 2011. "I hear they are aligned with Iran. I hear they may be aligned with al-Qaida." But Trump still said, "At this point, if you don't get rid of Gadhafi, it's a major, major black eye for this country." Our ruling Clinton said Trump is on record "extensively" supporting the attacks that unseated Libya’s Gadhafi. We actually didn’t find that many comments from Trump about Libya. But when he did speak, he was emphatic. In 2011, before the first bombing runs, Trump said, "We should go in, we should stop this guy." Even when he voiced concern over who would run Libya post-Gadhafi, he supported the intervention.

pomt-00782	"Half of all Americans have less than $10,000 in their savings account."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2015/apr/09/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-half-americans-have-less-10000/	U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, speaking in Austin, bemoaned widening income differences between the country’s very rich and the rest of us. And in his remarks at a South Austin union hall, the Vermont independent mulling a run for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination also warned about American failures to save money. "Here’s something not talked about, something that can make us all very, very nervous," Sanders said. "Half of all Americans have less than $10,000 in their savings account. "And you know what that means and you know why people are so stressed out? If you have less than $10,000," he said, "that means an automobile accident, a divorce, a serious illness, a crisis of one kind or another can drive you into bankruptcy and financial disaster." Is he right that half of us have less than $10K in savings? Sanders’ backup To our inquiry, a Sanders spokesman, Jeff Franks, said by email that Sanders relied on an April 2014 USA Today news story quoting a survey indicating 52 percent of U.S. workers had said they had less than $10,000 in total savings and investments, such as a 401(k) or IRA, that could be used for retirement. It did not include their homes or defined benefit plans, such as traditional pensions that could be used for retirement Specifically, the story said, 36 percent of workers said they had less than $1,000 in such savings and investments with another 16 percent of workers reporting $1,000 to $9,999 in such savings and investments. Those results came from a telephone survey of 1,000 workers and 501 retirees by the nonprofit Employee Benefit Research Institute and Greenwald and Associates. Next, we spotted a chart on the institute’s website drawn from the same 2014 Retirement Confidence Survey. The 52 percent of workers reporting less than $10,000 in savings and investments in 2014 is up from 39 percent in 2009, the chart shows. Of course, "workers" isn’t all of us. We called the Washington, D.C.-based institute, which says it was founded in 1978 to deliver unbiased information on employee benefit plans "so that decisions affecting the system may be made based on verifiable facts." By phone, researcher Craig Copeland told us that overall, 51 percent of survey respondents, meaning retirees and others, had less than $10,000 in financial savings. Also by phone, Ruth Helman of Greenwald and Associates, which helped do the survey, paused at the senator’s wording. "Strictly speaking, ‘their savings account’ isn’t correct. It’s total savings wherever it may be, under the mattress or wherever," Helman said. Federal Reserve Bank We wondered if there were other ways of looking at savings. Several experts urged us to contact the Federal Reserve Bank, which conducts a survey focused on consumer finances every three years. Its latest survey, drawing on data collected in 2013, resulted in a chart pointed out by Copeland indicating that the median value of financial savings outside of a pension or home reported by the nearly 95 percent of families who had bank accounts or stocks, bonds and other financial assets that year was $21,200, down from $23,000 in the board’s 2010 survey. SOURCE: Report, "Changes in U.S. Family Finances from 2010 to 2013: Evidence from the Survey of Consumer Finances," Federal Reserve Bulletin, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, September 2014 Copeland said that given that more than 5 percent of families reported no such financial assets, it’s reasonable to speculate that families overall had median financial savings of less than $20,000. We also asked reserve board officials to analyze the senator’s "savings accounts" statement. By phone, William Emmons and Bryan Noeth, both employed by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, raised questions. For instance, why not count a family’s home or pension as part of its savings? Reminder: The institute, with its focus on savings for retirement, set aside these asset categories. Emmons said: "People do count on their housing equity, not only in retirement, but before that." Beyond that, the pair said, it’s not always meaningful to focus on money held in "savings accounts," which are a single wealth indicator. "A savings account isn’t where everybody holds their money," Noeth said. The two said a potentially superior way to gauge how Americans are faring, savings-wise, would be to consider net worth meaning family assets compared to debts. An agency manager, Adriene Dempsey, emailed us a spreadsheet showing that according to the board’s 2013 survey, 26 percent of U.S. families had less than $10,000 in net worth--a tick worse than the 25 percent of families according to its 2010 study. In 2013, half of American families had about $81,500 in net wealth or more, according to the spreadsheet. Total assets for a family include financial assets, such as bank accounts, mutual funds and securities plus tangible assets, including real estate, vehicles and durable goods, according to a February 2015 essay by the St. Louis Fed. We’ve elaborated on this here. So by the net-worth metric, more families are better off than if one focused on financial savings alone. We ran this "net worth" angle past the institute’s Coleman, who reminded by email that its survey (relied on by Sanders) took into account financial assets, not just savings accounts. Our ruling Sanders said: "Half of all Americans have less than $10,000 in their savings account." Some clarification went missing here: A 2014 survey indicated about half of American adults had less than $10,000 in savings and investments, such as a 401(k) or IRA, that could be used for retirement; those results encompassed more than savings accounts.

pomt-08332	Stabilizing the recent financial crisis "will cost less than 1 percent of GDP," which is less than the 2.5 percent to fix the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/28/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-current-financial-recovery-has-b/	During his Oct. 27, 2010, interview on Comedy Central's The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, President Barack Obama defended the actions taken by the federal government to stabilize the financial crisis -- the source of much voter unhappiness on the campaign trail this year. Obama said, "If you look at how we have handled this financial crisis -- if you had told me two years ago that we're going to be able to stabilize the system, stabilize the stock market, stabilize the economy, and by the way, at the end of this thing, it will cost less than 1 percent of GDP, where the (1980s savings and loan) crisis cost us 2.5 percent of our entire economy -- a much smaller crisis -- I'd say, 'We'll take that,' because we saved taxpayers a whole lot of money." That's a striking comparison, so we immediately thought it deserved a fact-check. After a bit of research, we located the federal report that made that exact comparison. It was an October 2010 document from the Treasury Department titled, "Troubled Asset Relief Program: A Two Year Retrospective." The TARP, as the program is more commonly known, was created under President George W. Bush in the fall of 2008 to head off what policymakers and business leaders feared was a serious threat to the stability of the nation's financial system. Initially, independent observers projected that TARP would cost $350 billion or more, but the October 2010 report estimates that the total cost for TARP and related programs will be far lower -- about $29 billion. "We currently expect that the overall direct fiscal cost of all our financial interventions will be less than 1 percent of GDP," the report said. Using the $29 billion figure would easily make the 1 percent cutoff, since GDP for 2009 was just over $14 trillion. For the purpose of context, the report adds that "this result is notable compared to past systemic financial crises. An International Monetary Fund study found that the average net fiscal cost of resolving roughly 40 banking crises since 1970 was 13 percent of GDP. And according to the Government Accountability Office, the net fiscal cost of cleaning up the U.S. savings and loan crisis was 2.4 percent of GDP." We located the original IMF study cited in the Treasury report and found that it offers two estimates, using different methodology, of the pricetag for the savings and loan crisis, which occurred when thrifts, under lax regulation, made a series of risky investments that eventually turned bad and left depositors holding the bag. One estimate in the IMF report is 2.4 percent, which is very close to what Obama said. The other is 3.2 percent. Since Obama was satisfied with the lower cost estimate -- which wouldn't be in his interest in making this kind of comparison -- then we'll stipulate to using that estimate. So, Obama can point to a credible source for his statistical comparison. But we still think it's worth a closer look at the context behind the comparison. Here are two broad issues that we think are important to keep in mind: • The 1 percent may not include all costs. The Treasury report includes the cost of TARP outlays to support banks, carmakers and the housing sector, as well as TARP and Treasury Department funds used to shore up the troubled insurer AIG. However, it acknowledges several other types of outlays that are not included in its calculations, and adding in these costs would increase the total burden. "Outside of TARP, we expect to incur substantial losses from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (Government Sponsored Enterprises, or GSEs), through capital injections from Treasury to the GSEs through the Preferred Stock Purchase Agreements," the report says. The report adds that some of these additional losses would be made up by gains elsewhere. One source of expected income stems from authority provided by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act, under which Treasury purchased more than $200 billion in mortgage‐backed securities guaranteed by the GSEs. "Those investments are generating notable returns," the report said. "In addition, as a result of its emergency financial programs, remittances from Federal Reserve operations to the Federal Budget have increased sharply in 2009 and 2010, and they are projected to remain elevated for some time. While considerable uncertainty remains, revenues from these two sources will significantly offset to likely losses elsewhere." Also not included in the cost is the added deposit insurance payments under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The widely popular decision to increase the level of assets protected by the FDIC from $100,000 to $250,000 means that taxpayers are now on the hook for greater payouts when banks fail. And unlike during the S&L crisis, the behind-the-scenes role of the Federal Reserve has been huge in the post-2008 recovery. After the 2008 crisis, the Fed acted in a variety of ways to stabilize various financial markets -- securing loans, for instance, or making implicit guarantees of purchases. This amounted to a "shadow budget," says Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget -- that is, one that's not officially on the books but which has consequences elsewhere in the economy. Meanwhile, the report acknowledges additional, intangible costs to the financial crisis that are hard to factor into any calculation. "Our estimates do not reflect the full economic and fiscal costs of this crisis," the report said, "whether measured in the millions of Americans still searching for work, the lost income for business, or the impact of the recession on federal and state budgets." Indeed, one obvious exclusion is that the Treasury report doesn't count the cost of the economic stimulus bill, originally estimated at $787 billion. On one level, that may be wise, since it's a cleaner way to compare the current recovery efforts to the S&L debacle, given that the earlier episode was essentially a banking crisis, not an economy-wide crisis. On the other hand, the president's statement -- which included the words "stabilize the economy" -- seems to suggest a broader interpretation that includes the cost of the stimulus. Put all of this together and you have a lot of different ways to calculate the numbers. "There are so many variables on either side that it's impossible to say whether you can really compare the costs" of the two episodes, said Kathleen Day, a former journalist and author of S&L Hell: The People and the Politics Behinid the $1 Trillion Savings and Loan Scandal. While we think the statistic Obama used is legitimate, it's more the start of the argument than the end of it. And it omits a number of costs that reasonable people might think should be included. • The figure Obama cited is a snapshot in time, but the costs are not over yet. To take but one example: The Treasury estimate relies on the assumption that the value of the federal government's investments -- which are effectively keeping down the TARP's cost -- remain stable rather than declining. "We expect that TARP investments in the banks and the credit market programs will be profitable," the report says. "The recently announced restructuring of AIG will accelerate the government’s exit on terms that are likely to lead to an overall profit on the government’s support for AIG, including the value of Treasury’s interests in AIG held outside of TARP." That may turn out to be true -- but it also may not. And if it doesn't, taxpayers could be on the hook for higher costs. In fact, if Obama had made the comparison much earlier in the crisis, the federal government would have been on the hook "for a potentially enormous bill," said Arthur E. Wilmarth Jr., a law professor at George Washington University who specializes in business and finance. "It is fortunate that the ultimate bill will probably turn out to be much lower than the worst-case-scenario." By the same token, he said, troubles in the housing market could increase the cost of recovery efforts within another year or two. "In my opinion, it is far too early to conclude that we have successfully contained and resolved the financial crisis." So where does this leave us? Obama has repeated a defensible estimate of the cost of the two financial crises. But there are lots of other estimates that would be equally if not more valid, and those wouldn't be as favorable to the White House's case. The figures Obama cited don't include many of the ancillary (and often intangible) costs of the recovery, and there's no way of knowing for sure that current cost estimates won't go up in future years. On balance, we rate his comment Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2010-10-28T18:24:35	2010-10-27	['None']

pomt-09051	"West has raised $2 million from those that would leave our beaches in ruins, end Social Security and Medicare, and give corporations free reign."	false	/florida/statements/2010/jul/01/ron-klein/klein-lumps-all-wests-donors-together/	Democratic Congressman Ron Klein has gone on the offensive in his campaign against Republican retired Army Lt. Col. Allen West -- whose $2 million war chest and national media attention have turned the race into one of the hottest Congressional contests in Florida. Klein represents a swing Congressional district that spans parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties. Klein wants to capitalize on voters' anger about the BP spill and hammers West in a June 28 fundraising e-mail. The bulk of his e-mail with the subject line "Apologize to BP?!" relates to West's stance on the oil spill and his connection to Congressman Joe Barton, the Texas Republican facing heat after apologizing to BP and calling Obama's demand for the escrow account a "shakedown." "In short, while sheets of oil are washing up today on Pensacola Beach, he’s more concerned with BP’s profits than the livelihood of fishermen, restaurateurs, or those that depend on FL tourism...," Klein wrote about his opponent West. "Barton called the Obama administration’s push for BP to set up a $20 billion account - a fund that would ultimately help pay for clean up and damages and wages for those who are losing their livelihood - a 'shakedown.' Most Republicans have made it very clear that Barton’s actions were unacceptable. Not Allen West. A continuing supporter of offshore drilling, West’s campaign is now aligned with those who would apparently give BP a pass. Thus far, the most radical Tea Partiers have taken a liking to West and what he stands for. They also haven’t been shy in contributing to his cause. West has raised $2 million from those that would leave our beaches in ruins, end Social Security and Medicare, and give corporations free reign." There are a lot of strong statements in Klein's letter that we could have chosen to fact-check. But we particularly thought that last sentence was a biting claim, and we don't mean the usual spelling of "free rein." Note Klein didn't say that West would ruin Florida's beaches, end Social Security and Medicare, and give corporations free rein -- he said that $2 million in donations to West came from donors who held those views. For this Truth-O-Meter we wanted to explore whether "West has raised $2 million from those that would leave our beaches in ruins, end Social Security and Medicare, and give corporations free reign." We contacted Klein's campaign and asked for documentation to support their claim. Campaign spokeswoman Sarah Rothschild sent us about two dozen citations for news articles and web sites that relate to West and his donors, but she declined to define what Klein meant by "give corporations free reign." We looked at most of their citations, focusing on BP and Rep. Joe Barton since that was the point of Klein's e-mail, and we break the other donors down by topic below. First, we confirmed that West had raised $2,065,855 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. It's not logical to assume that every one those donors would ruin the beaches and end Medicare and Social Security. We found a few tenuous connections to those issues among a small handful of donors but not enough for a blanket statement. Congressman Joe Barton West got $1,000 from Rep. Joe Barton's Texas Freedom Fund PAC on March 3, 2010, FEC reports show. On June 17 at a Congressional hearing on BP, Barton, the ranking member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, defended BP. The Wasington Post's Right Now blog reported that Barton said: "It is a tragedy of the first proportion that a private corporation can be subjected to what I would characterize as a shakedown, in this case a $20 billion shakedown." Later the same day, Barton apologized for his apology after Republican leaders threatened to take away his committee leadership position. The Tampa Tribune reported June 25 that West about a week earlier had also raised concerns about the BP escrow account at a business luncheon in Palm Beach Gardens. "West said that while he was 'angry with BP' for the spill, 'when you have an executive branch that goes to a private sector business and takes their private equity funds and demands that they put it into an escrow account, something is upside down in this country. That is a very dangerous precedent that we establish.'" Even though West may not like the way the restitution happened, the Freedom Fund donation came about a month before the Gulf oil well blowout. So we moved on to the other citations Klein's camp sent us. Oil and gas, banks The CRP analysis showed -- and West doesn't dispute -- that by June 29 he had received about $6,850 from donors identified as being in the oil and gas industry. But we could not find any donations in this race from BP, or even Exxon, the company involved in the 1989 major Alaskan oil spill. (As an aside, we'll note the records show that Klein received $1,000 from BP in 2006 and $500 in 2008.) CRP showed that by the same date, West had received $8,600 from donors identified as Bank of America. Klein's campaign cites lavish Super Bowl parties and financial shenanigans by Bank of America, but no connection to beaches, Medicare or Social Security or giving corporations free rein. The PACs Next, we looked at political action committees, some of them set up by controversial public officials: West got $2,500 from the PAC of an insurance company called Torchmark, according to the FEC report. The American Association of Justice in 2008 listed the company in its "10 Worst Insurance Companies in America" for what it said were transgressions, but again, nothing there about beaches, Medicare, Social Security or free rein. West got $5,000 in March 2010 from Rep. Paul Ryan's Prosperity PAC, FEC reports show, and Ryan is the congressman whose budget proposal, A Roadmap to America's Future, was described in The Atlantic Feb. 2 as "essentially privatized Social Security and strangled Medicare inflation with cost-controlled vouchers." There, finally, is a link to Klein's claim about support for deep cuts in Social Security and Medicare. Next up was former House Majority Leader Dick Armey's FreedomWorks PAC, which stands for "lower taxes, less government, more freedom." The PAC hosted a fundraiser for West March 22 and named him as one of its Champions of Freedom. Though Klein didn't cite an amount, we found FEC reports that show FreedomWorks made $841 in in-kind contributions to the West campaign in March and April 2010. In an interview on Meet the Press, Armey called Medicare "tyranny" because seniors are forced to participate, according to an Aug. 16, 2009, article in Politico. On its website, FreedomWorks is critical of Social Security. Armey was also critical of the $20 billion BP escrow fund, according to a June 17, 2010, post in Right Now, the Washington Post blog. "I'm against it -- there is no doubt that BP has resititution to make, but there is something called due process through the legitimate judicial branch of government through which these things should be adjudicated." So Armey or his PAC are highly critical of Social Security and Medicare -- part of Klein's claim -- and Armey was also critical of the creation of the BP escrow fund, though that doesn't mean he would leave our beaches in ruins. Last, we checked Sarah Palin's PAC, which gave West $1,000 in March, FEC records show. On June 20, 2010, Sarah Palin tweeted, “Gulf disaster needs divine intervention as man’s efforts have been futile. Gulf lawmakers designate today Day of Prayer for solution/miracle.” Klein's campaign also cited a June 12, 2010, Fox News report in which she blamed lax government regulations for the spill. Thouugh she criticized the Obama administration's response and "extreme environmentalists" we don't think that means Palin wants to leave our beaches in ruin. We also don't think Palin would call for praying for a miracle after clean-up efforts failed if she wanted the beaches destroyed. And blaming "lax government regulations" doesn't sound like she wants to give the oil companies free rein. Clearly, West has taken money from at least a few donors that have either been sympathetic to BP, in favor of massive cuts to Social Security and Medicare or affiliated with corporations that have been accused of wrongdoing. But that's not what Klein's campaign said. Klein's fundraising e-mail said: "West has raised $2 million from those that would leave our beaches in ruins, end Social Security and Medicare and give corporations free reign." The donors the Klein campaign cited added up to about $25,000 -- only a sliver of his $2 million campaign. The West campaign could cherrypick too and likely find negative headlines about some of Klein's donors -- including BP in previous election cycles. But we don't think that we can draw conclusions about all of Klein's donors based on his BP donations. Similarily, there is no way Klein would know the viewpoints of all of West's donors unless he researched all of their views on these topics -- an impossible endeavor. We rate this claim False.

pomt-09924	Under the "Cash for Clunkers" program, "all we've got to do is ... go to a local junkyard, all you've got to do is tow it to your house. And you're going to get $4,500."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jun/22/sean-hannity/hannity-claims-loophole-cash-clunkers-program-woul/	On his Fox News Channel program on June 18, 2009, political commentator Sean Hannity mocked the "Cash for Clunkers" program recently approved by Congress, saying a loophole would allow someone to buy an old heap at a junkyard, have it towed to his or her house, and the government would pay $4,500 for it. The Cash for Clunkers program is actually called the "Consumer Assistance to Recycle and Save Act of 2009." Having passed the House and Senate, it now sits on the president's desk awaiting his signature. Under the program, people can get $3,500 to $4,500 if they trade in their old gas-guzzler for a more fuel-efficient new car. The idea is to boost the ailing auto industry while improving the environment. There are lots of eligibility rules, and you can read all about them here in a Web site created by the government. The bill provides $1 billion for the program from July through November. In an interview with Hannity, Sen. John McCain criticized the program as more "out-of-control spending" by the Obama administration. Hannity then added his claim about how it would be easy to game the system to soak the government. "Listen, all we've got to do is you got to go to a local junkyard — all you've got to do is tow (the car) to your house. And you're going to get $4,500," Hannity said. "I'm going to go do that." Actually, legislators anticipated just such a scheme and included provisions to prevent it. First, the law requires that the vehicle must be in "drivable condition." So if it needs to be towed to your house, no dice. And second, the trade-in has to have been "continuously insured consistent with the applicable state law and registered to the same owner for a period of not less than one year immediately prior to such trade-in." In English: You have to have owned the car for a year, and you have to be able to prove it. Those safeguards were written into the bill to safeguard against the very scenario Hannity described, said Rae Tyson, a spokesman for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Hannity's statement is "not accurate," he said. You could always lie and forge documents. (Don't do it, Sean!) But that would be fraud. And the bill says anyone who knowingly violates the provisions of the program could face a fine of up to $15,000. The wording in the legislation makes this one an easy call for us. The bill is written to prohibit the very scenario Hannity describes as possible. His statement goes on the junk heap. We rule it False.

pomt-15062	Says Ronald Reagan "reversed his world’s ‘largest tax cut’ and raised taxes when revenues did not match the expectations."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2015/sep/25/stephen-colbert/stephen-colbert-brings-ronald-reagans-tax-raising-/	Stephen Colbert has interviewed a slew of presidential candidates in the first weeks of his new job hosting CBS’ The Late Show, including Jeb Bush, Donald Trump, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. His time with Cruz on Sept. 21 stood out for a fact-filled back and forth about a major Republican role model, President Ronald Reagan. Colbert asked Cruz if he could agree with Reagan’s support of amnesty for undocumented immigrants and record of raising taxes amid budget shortfalls. Cruz said "of course not" before pivoting to Reagan’s most conservative accomplishments, one being that he "signed the largest tax cut in history" and spurred economic growth. "You know, when Reagan came in, from 1978 to 1982, economic growth averaged less than 1 percent a year. There’s only one other four-year period where that’s true. That’s true from 2008 to 2012," Cruz said. Colbert jumped in, saying "But when conditions changed in the country, he reversed his world’s ‘largest tax cut’ and raised taxes when revenues did not match the expectations. So it’s a matter of compromising." PolitiFact explored Cruz’s point about economic growth in another fact-check. We wondered if Colbert’s retort was on the money or overstated. (It’s our first fact-check of Colbert in his new role — and the first one in five years, period.) Did Reagan really shift course on tax cuts when the growth stopped? A CBS press contact did not return an email for comment. Reagan’s tax cut As Cruz said, the Gipper really did cut taxes — with the help of Congress — in his first year as president. The "largest tax cut in history" that Cruz mentioned is in reference to the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, a $38 billion phased-in cut ($99 billion in 2015 dollars). Put in the way that economists prefer to discuss tax cuts, it represented 1.91 percent of the country’s gross domestic product. This law included across-the-board cuts of about 30 percent to statutory income tax rates. As Colbert said, Reagan raised taxes, too. Two laws, one in 1982 and another in 1984, were especially dramatic. These laws generally raised taxes by removing tax loopholes, not by raising the tax rate, said Dean Baker, a liberal economist and co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. Still, Baker said, "the loopholes were big ones." Reagan’s tax increases 1982: The most significant tax increase Reagan signed was also the first. The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (yes, another law with a very sexy name) increased taxes by almost 1 percent of GDP. The 1982 tax increase was "probably the largest peacetime tax increase in American history," said economist Bruce Bartlett, who advised Reagan on domestic policy and then worked as Treasury deputy assistant secretary for economic policy in the George H.W. Bush administration. (An analysis by Jerry Tempalski, an analyst in the Office of Tax Analysis with the U.S. Department of the Treasury, agrees.) This law was driven by pressure to attack the federal budget deficit, as well as the impression that Reagan’s tax-cutting was partially responsible for lower-than-expected tax revenues. Bartlett, who reviewed Reagan’s tax record for Tax Notes in 2011, cited a Treasury estimate that the 1982 law raised taxes by almost 1 percent of GDP, or about $150 billion in modern dollars. Specifically, it rolled back some but not all of the 1981 tax cut for writing off equipment, and it repealed 1981 "safe harbor" leasing provisions, said Stephen J. Entin, senior fellow at the Tax Foundation and former deputy assistant secretary for economic policy in the Reagan administration. 1983: A law Reagan signed in 1983 aimed to keep Social Security afloat by increasing payroll taxes and taxing Social Security benefits for some high-earners. This cost $24.6 billion, or almost $50 billion in 2015 dollars, through 1988, according to an administration estimate. 1984: The Deficit Reduction Act that Reagan signed rolled back part of the 1981 cut on buildings, Entin said, with the idea that Congress would enact spending cuts. "But many of those cuts were either never enacted or were later restored," Entin said. This led to $25 billion in tax receipts. Reagan also signed tax increases in 1985, 1986, 1987 and 1988 (as well as a couple other laws with revenue reductions). So where does that leave Reagan’s tax record on the whole? It’s mixed. On one hand, revenues were lower as a share of GDP in his last year in office (17.6 percent of GDP in 1988) compared to the year before he took office (18.5 percent of GDP in 1980), according to the White House Office of Management and Budget. However, the thrust of the 1981 tax cut that Cruz touted on Colbert’s show didn’t prove to have lasting effects on the whole. A 2006 Treasury Department analysis offers another view of the plunge after the 1981 law and the subsequent changes that wound it back. Reagan’s staff tallied up the effect of major legislation on tax receipts over his tenure for his final budget proposal (page 4-4). The 1981 tax cuts comprised most of the total $275 billion in tax relief, but the other side of the ledger listed $133 billion in cumulative tax increases. "Thus, Reagan took back about half the 1981 tax cut with subsequent tax increases," Bartlett wrote. Our ruling Responding to Cruz’s assertion that Reagan "signed the largest tax cut in history," Colbert said he "reversed" it and "raised taxes when revenues did not match the expectations." Legislation that Reagan signed over his time in office and raised taxes did not completely reverse the 1981 Economic Recovery Tax Act. But the broader point Colbert makes is on point. Reagan agreed to raise taxes to deal with budget deficits, even if he wasn’t enthusiastic about it. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-13236	Colorado saw "increased incidents of emergency room visits by young people" and "increased incidents of driving while under the influence of marijuana" following the legalization of recreational pot.	half-true	/california/statements/2016/oct/19/scott-jones/hazy-data-make-colorado-marijuana-claim-half-true/	Asked about California’s effort to legalize recreational marijuana, Republican congressional candidate Scott Jones said the experiences in Colorado are a stark warning of what not to do. Jones is Sacramento County’s sheriff and is running against Democratic Rep. Ami Bera for the region’s 7th District Congressional seat. "We can look to Colorado ... and look at the horrific results," Jones said during a debate this week between the two candidates in Sacramento. "If you look at the increased incidents of emergency room visits by young people. If you look at the increased incidents of driving while under the influence of marijuana. All voters have to do is see what happened in Colorado to predict what’s going to happen here." Scott Jones makes his claim about marijuana at about the 10:20 minute mark in the video above. California voters in November will decide on Proposition 64, which would legalize recreational pot for those 21 and older. Both Jones and Bera oppose the measure. Several other states will also vote on legalizing recreational or medicinal marijuana on Election Day. Colorado voted to legalize marijuana in 2012 and the law went into effect in 2014. We wondered if Jones was right? Did Colorado see a spike in ER trips by young people and more cases of driving while stoned after it legalized pot? Our research The first part of Jones’ statement appears to be correct. Several studies document a rise in trips to Colorado emergency rooms by young people. As reported in the Denver Post in July, a study in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics found "Colorado’s laws on labeling and child-resistant packaging have been unable to stop an increase of young kids ending up in the emergency room after accidentally consuming marijuana." The study found "... cases for pediatric marijuana increased significantly and at a higher rate than the rest of the United States." Examining Jones’ claim about an increase in incidents of driving while under the influence of marijuana was more complex. There’s not much data yet on the topic because the state only started tracking marijuana-related traffic incidents in 2014, according to a Colorado State Patrol spokesman quoted in the Denver Post last year. Jones’ campaign manager pointed us to a Colorado State Patrol report showing mixed results. It says the percentage of DUIs in the state where marijuana or marijuana in combination with alcohol or other drugs was the perceived impairing substance increased from 12 percent in 2014 to 15 percent in 2015. The same report, however, shows the raw number of citations for DUIs involving marijuana or marijuana in combination with other drugs dropped slightly during the same two years, from 674 to 665. A separate Colorado study pointed to by Jones’ campaign reported there’s been an increase in the percentage of drivers testing positive for marijuana involved in fatal traffic accidents. Making things more cloudy, however, that report includes a note from the Colorado State Patrol that "marijuana citations" are defined as those where marijuana was present "based on officer opinion only," noting there’s "no toxicological confirmation." Radley Balko, who blogs about criminal justice for the Washington Post, wrote in 2014 that a spike in the number of drivers who are tested and found to have traces of marijuana in their system would not be a surprise in Colorado, nor would it mean marijuana necessarily contributed to a traffic accident. "All that a positive test tells us is that the driver has smoked pot at some point in the past few days or weeks," Balko wrote, noting the drug can linger in a person’s system for days after its effects wear off. "It makes sense that loosening restrictions on pot would result in a higher percentage of drivers involved in fatal traffic accidents having smoked the drug at some point over the past few days or weeks," Balko added. Our ruling Scott Jones said Colorado saw "increased incidents of emergency room visits by young people" and "increased incidents of driving while under the influence of marijuana" following the state’s legalization of recreational marijuana. Studies show the state indeed experienced a spike in ER visits by young people related to marijuana. Less clear is how marijuana-related traffic incidents have changed since the state legalized the drug. Studies have limited data and show mixed results. Further complicating the matter, marijuana can remain in a driver’s system days after the effect of the drug has worn off, making it difficult to determine whether the drug was the primary factor in an accident. Jones’ statement on the ER visits is accurate. But there’s not enough convincing data to prove the second portion of his claim. We rate it Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

pomt-10132	Barack Obama opposed a bill that would have saved Gianna Jessen's life.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/09/bornalivetruth-org/abortion-survivor-would-have-been-protected-under-/	An ad from an independent advocacy group, BornAliveTruth.org, criticizes Barack Obama's votes on abortion when he was a state senator in Illinois. The ad shows a young woman, Gianna Jessen, looking directly at the camera and saying the following: "Can you imagine not giving babies their basic human rights, no matter how they entered our world? My name's Gianna Jessen, born 31 years ago after a failed abortion. But if Barack Obama had his way, I wouldn't be here. Four times Barack Obama voted to oppose a law to protect babies left to die after failed abortions. Senator Obama, please support born alive infant protections. I'm living proof these babies have a right to live." View the ad here . The ad refers to Illinois legislation put forward in 2001, 2002 and 2003 by opponents of abortion. The intent was to require doctors to provide immediate life-saving care to any infant that survived an intended abortion. The legislation, which included multiple bills, specified that an infant surviving a planned abortion is "born alive" and "shall be fully recognized as a human person and accorded immediate protection under the law." The bills' supporters said it gave added emphasis to laws already on the books, deterring the death of abortion survivors from neglect. One of the bills' strongest supporters was a nurse, Jill Stanek, who said she had witnessed infants left to die in dirty utility rooms. Abortion-rights proponents, on the other hand, said the legislation was a back-door attempt to stop legal abortions. Illinois already had a law on its books from 1975 that said if a doctor suspected an abortion was scheduled for a viable fetus — meaning able to survive outside of the mother's body — then the child must receive medical care if it survives the abortion. The new laws didn't distinguish between viable and nonviable, meaning that an infant of any age that survived an abortion should receive care. Obama did vote against the laws, by voting no or present on the bills. (In Illinois, a present vote has the same weight as a no vote.) But because of the older law, Jessen is wrong when she says "if Barack Obama had his way, I wouldn't be here." According to the medical records provided by the organization that produced the ad, Jessen was born at 29 weeks, which would have been a viable pregnancy and subject to the older Illinois law requiring that she receive medical care. So it's not correct to say that Obama opposed that. Also, Jessen was born in California, not Illinois. We know Jessen is speaking somewhat figuratively here, but the fact is that someone born under similar circumstances in Illinois would have been protected under the law. Obama has said he supported the existing law and felt it provided sufficient protection for abortion survivors like Jessen. We rule her statement False.

pomt-02449	Says Lamar Smith "sponsored the bill that funded Obamacare."	false	/texas/statements/2014/feb/27/texas-liberty-pac/legislative-maneuver-continue-government-spending-/	No Republican in Congress voted for the 2010 health-care overhaul known as the Obamacare law. But red-and-white "Stop Lamar Smith" signs that cropped up recently in Austin charge that Smith, a Republican U.S. House member from San Antonio, "sponsored the bill that funded Obamacare." The sign attributes the claim to the Texas Liberty PAC. Founder Dave Nalle of Manor told us the group is a newborn Republican-initiated super PAC focused on defeating Smith. The claim stood out to us because Smith voted against the Affordable Care Act, and he doesn’t serve on the House Appropriations Committee, where spending bills originate. And what was the basis of the anti-Smith sign? By email, Nalle said Smith "introduced" the 2014 Omnibus Spending Bill, or House Resolution 3547, which became law on Jan. 17, 2014, according to an online summary posted by Congress. The summary identifies Smith as the proposal’s sponsor. And, Nalle told us, the law "was the primary vehicle through which programs passed in the Affordable Care Act were funded." First, we’ll look at what was in that act, and then we’ll tackle Smith’s role. The spending plan funded the government through September 2014. It cleared the House by 359-67 with Smith voting in favor of it. In a Jan. 15, 2014, press release, Smith said that he supported the spending bill for reasons including defense spending, saying too that the measure did not provide "additional funding" for the Obamacare law. A news story posted Jan. 15, 2014, by the Hill, a Capitol Hill newspaper, quoted Rep. Hal Rogers, R-Ky., the Appropriations Committee chairman, as saying: "We've made sure that this bill provides no new funding for Obamacare and have even cut existing Obamacare funds to the tune of over $1 billion." The newspaper said Rogers was referring to a $1 billion cut to a preventive health care fund intended under the Obamacare law. So, the spending plan with Smith’s name attached had at least some funding of the Obamacare law — and it funded many other government initiatives as well. To gauge Smith’s listed sponsorship of the act, we queried experts including Donald Wolfensberger, a former longtime congressional staff member who directs the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. That’s when this claim began to grow, well, spacy. Wolfensberger told us by email and telephone that Smith’s involvement began when he sponsored an unrelated minor piece of legislation. That bill morphed into the vehicle chosen by congressional leaders to get the crucial spending package passed. Smith "was a hapless victim in some way," Wolfensberger said. Let’s cut to the details. On Nov. 20, 2013, Smith introduced a one-page proposal extending the license application deadline for commercial space launch indemnity insurance, which then "passed the House under suspension of the rules (a process for noncontroversial matters), and then the Senate with an amendment," Wolfensberger noted. These actions occurred Dec. 2 and Dec. 12, 2013, Congress says. A congressional website shows this December 2013 image of Smith’s Senate-amended proposal: After the Senate version of the proposal returned to the House, Wolfensberger said, "Smith’s bill was used as the vehicle in which to stuff the 1,500-page, $1.012-trillion omnibus government funding bill," which then cleared the House and Senate to be signed into law by President Barack Obama on Jan. 17, 2014. It’s nearly 650 pages long, including the limited language of Smith’s original. There was a procedural rationale for changing Smith’s space proposal into the spending plan. Wolfensberger said because the original legislation had already been acted on by the Senate, the House-embraced appropriations swap-in removed an opportunity for Senate opponents to stall it. It all comes down to the parliamentary rules that govern Congress. "It’s still possible to filibuster the meat of a matter from the House," he said, "but there is no option to block proceeding to consideration of a House measure already amended by the Senate that’s coming back from the House." Separately, Smith’s office emailed us an April 5, 2013, report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service confirming this point and stating: "The ability to take up a matter without debate can potentially make a difference in the Senate because the Senate then needs to end debate only on the main question (or questions)." Stan Collender, who has written a guide to the federal budget, said by email that most of the Obamacare law’s provisions did not need funding through the appropriations act. "Saying that" Smith "sponsored the bill that funded Obamacare is a gross misstatement," Collender said. Also by email, political scientist Roy Meyers of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, said that while the omnibus act provided some funding to administer the Obamacare law, Smith’s original bill was for a different purpose. "So it's really a classic dirty trick by the Texas Liberty PAC to not acknowledge that the House Rules Committee made this bill the vehicle for passing the Consolidated Appropriations Act, amending the original bill to add all of the appropriations language," Meyers said. Smith’s office also sent us an email including Smith’s statement tracking with what we heard from the outside congressional observers. Jennifer Hing, a staff spokeswoman for the House Appropriations Committee, further told us by email that Smith’s measure was the only Senate-approved House bill available at the time the appropriations act was rolled into it. We circled back to Nalle, who said the conversion of Smith’s proposal into the appropriations vehicle doesn’t take away from the fact that Smith sponsored the act funding the Obamacare law. "To suggest that he is not responsible for the sponsorship of a bill which he did sponsor and which he voted to amend and to pass is disingenuous," Nalle emailed. "His votes show that he clearly supported the bill just as much when it passed as when it was originally written. There was no point in the process in which he, as sponsor of the bill, did not cooperate with and support the process which produced the final bill." Our ruling The PAC’s sign said Smith "sponsored the bill that funded Obamacare." To the contrary, legislative leaders amended a brief Smith proposal related to space ships to fold in the 2014 appropriations act, which included some Obamacare-tied expenditures. This claim distorts a leadership strategic maneuver to continue government spending to misrepresent Smith’s role and position on the Obamacare law. We rate it as False.

pomt-15025	Iran’s "regime is responsible for more than 1,000 American casualties during the Iraq war" and "has plotted a terrorist attack here in our nation's capital."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2015/oct/05/michael-mccaul/michael-mccaul-says-iran-blame-more-1000-us-casual/	Iran, a Texas congressman says, warrants blame for American casualties in Iraq and plotting an attack in Washington, D.C. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Austin, chairman of the U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security, delivered the Republican Party’s Sept. 12, 2015, weekly address, speaking mostly about why he opposes the Iran nuclear agreement announced a couple months before. Fourteen years after the 9/11 attacks, McCaul said, "the struggle continues. … We cannot forget that the radical Shi'a regime in Iran remains the world's leading sponsor of terrorism. Iran's leaders have called for our defeat and the destruction of our close ally, Israel. The regime is responsible for more than 1,000 American casualties during the Iraq war; they have plotted a terrorist attack here in our nation's capital and launched destructive cyber attacks against American companies." It’s not a surprise, perhaps, that unfriendly governments including Iran try cyberattacks, nor is it news that Iran has called for Israel’s fall. But we wondered if McCaul was right about Iran being responsible for the described casualties in Iraq and plotting an attack on our nation’s capital. By email, McCaul spokesman Walter Zaykowski answered our request for elaboration by saying the casualty count originated with the Pentagon. He said McCaul’s mention of Iran plotting an attack in Washington, D.C., reflected the May 2013 conviction of an Iranian-American resident of San Antonio for plotting to kill Saudi Arabia’s ambassador to the United States. Let’s check casualties, then flashback to the described plot. Iran’s declared connection to casualties In his email, Zaykowski pointed out September 2015 news stories about more than 1,000 Iran-linked American casualties in Iraq published by Defense One, which focuses on "topics and trends that will define the future of U.S. defense and national security." A Sept. 8, 2015, Defense One story said that according to recently declassified Pentagon documents, 196 American soldiers were killed in Iraq from November 2005 to December 2011 by 1,526 "explosively formed penetrators," which are particularly deadly roadside bombs, with another 861 American soldiers getting injured. SOURCE: News story, "How Many US Troops Were Killed By Iranian IEDs in Iraq?" Defense One, Sept. 8, 2015 (illustration reprinted with permission). The Iran connection? The story said the Pentagon attributes the presence of the EFPs in Iraq "to the Quds Force, the special forces arm of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard led by Qasem Soleimani. Various EFP ‘factories’ were found throughout Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom." This sentence in the story included a web link to a Feb. 27, 2007, New York Times news story, datelined Baghdad, describing bomb parts uncovered by U.S. forces in Iraq as possible evidence of factories making EFPs, "which explode and hurl out a high-speed blob of copper designed to cut through tough American armor." According to that story, though, an Iran connection wasn’t firmed up. The story said that while the find gave "experts much more information on the makings of the E.F.P.’s, which the American military has repeatedly argued must originate in Iran, the cache also included items that appeared to cloud the issue. Among the confusing elements were cardboard boxes of the gray plastic PVC tubes used to make the canisters. The boxes appeared to contain shipments of tubes directly from factories in the Middle East, none of them in Iran. One box said in English that the tubes inside had been made in the United Arab Emirates and another said, in Arabic, ‘plastic made in Haditha,’ a restive Sunni town on the Euphrates River in Iran. The Defense One story went on to say "the exact degree to which Iran bears culpability for arming Shia militias in Iraq with EFPs and related equipment is a matter of some dispute." That sentence noted an April 10, 2007, story in the Columbia Journalism Review cautioning against news reporters accepting characterizations of the EFPs as coming from Iran. The Defense One story noted that Gen. Joseph Dunford, the incoming chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at his July 9, 2015, Senate confirmation hearing: "We weren’t always able to attribute the casualties that we had to Iranian activity, although many times we suspected it was Iranian activity, even though we didn’t necessarily have the forensics to support that." At the hearing, the story said, Dunford said the numbers of American soldiers killed by Iran "has been recently quoted as about 500." Through the Nexis database, we spotted the question that led to Dunford’s assessment. At the hearing, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., asked Dunford: "When you served in Iraq and Afghanistan, do you know how many soldiers, Marines underneath your command were killed by Iranian activities?" DUNFORD: "Senator, I know the total number of soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines that were killed by Iranian activities, and the number has been recently quoted as about 500. We weren't always able to attribute the casualties that we had to -- to Iranian activity, although many times we suspected it was Iranian activity, even though we didn't necessarily have the forensics to support that." Defense One’s story said the U.S. Central Command, CENTCOM, "later clarified that Dunford was referring to total American deaths by EFPs and other Iranian weapons." The story quoted Maj. Genieve Davis, a CENTCOM spokeswoman saying in an email that it’s "important to understand that the CENTCOM statistics on EFP detonations are a subset of all the Iranian activities estimated to have killed approximately 500 U.S. troops in Iraq during OIF." David further said data about the roughly 300 deaths not caused by EFPs, including the kind of weapons used in the attacks, is classified, Defense One reported. To our inquiry, CENTCOM spokesman Max Blumenfeld emailed a similar statement saying 196 "U.S. service member deaths resulted from Iranian Explosively Formed Penetrators (EFPs) which are very deadly improvised explosive devices." He said too that those deaths were a subset of "all the Iranian activities estimated to have killed approximately 500 U.S. troops in Iraq during" Operation Iraqi Freedom, the U.S.-led operations in Iraq from March 2003 through August 2010. "For example," Blumenfeld wrote, "there were rocket attacks and IRAM (improvised rocket-assisted munitions) among other tactics that also contributed to American soldier deaths." Along similar lines, a Sept. 11, 2015, Defense One news story said many of the additional deaths likely were caused by improvised rocket assisted munitions, described in one Joint IED Defeat Organization document as "a rocket-fired improvised explosive device made from a large metal canister — such as a propane gas tank — filled with explosives, scrap metal and ball bearings and propelled by rockets." First seen in Iraq in 2007, the story said, the IRAM — "essentially an airborne version of a roadside bomb — a flying IED" is "the signature weapon used by Iranian-backed militias that operate with the aid of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Group," the story described the undated document saying. We asked Blumenfeld to specify casualties believed to have been caused by Iranian-connected explosives. He declined, emailing: "We cannot provide more information than what has been already furnished." The D.C. plot So, when did Iran plot a terrorist attack in the U.S. capital? On May 30, 2013, as reported by the Times that day, a U.S. district judge, John F. Keenan, sentenced an Iranian-American living in Texas and accused of plotting to hire assassins to murder Saudi Arabia’s U.S. ambassador to 25 years in prison. The story said Mansour J. Arbabsiar, a naturalized American citizen living in Texas,had been arrested in September 2011 at New York’s Kennedy International Airport, ultimately pleading guilty to his role in a scheme in which he evidently thought he was lining up a Mexican drug cartel to plant a bomb in a Washington restaurant where, the described plot went, the ambassador would be dining. The story said Arbabsiar lived in Corpus Christi though an Oct. 28, 2012, Austin American-Statesman news story, citing court filings quoting Arbabsiar’s comments to a psychiatrist, said that in 2010, Arbabsiar had moved from Corpus Christi to Round Rock, near Austiin. When Arbabsiar was arrested, the Times story said, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said the plot had been "directed and approved by elements of the Iranian government and, specifically, senior members of the Quds force," which is part of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. Holder said in an Oct. 11, 2011, statement the "deadly plot" was "directed by factions of the Iranian government." Arbabsiar, he said, was being "accused of working with members of an arm of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps to devise an international murder-for-hire scheme targeting the" ambassador. Holder said the complaint would say Arbabsiar allegedly orchestrated the plot with Gholam Shakuri, an Iranian-based member of the Qods Force. According to the complaint, Arbabsiar--with Shakuri’s approval--had facilitated the wiring of approximately $100,000 into a bank account in the United States as a down payment for the attempted assassination. Holder said the complaint also said that in the days since the defendant’s arrest, he had confessed to his participation in the alleged plot. The Times story on Arbabsiar’s sentencing said the assassination plan, according to unnamed government officials, involved Arbabsiar paying a member of the Los Zetas drug cartel $1.5 million to plant a bomb at a Washington restaurant while the Saudi ambassador, Adel al-Jubeir, dined. But Arbabsiar, drawn into the plot by a cousin in Iran who was a high-ranking member of the Quds Force, turned to a man in Mexico he believed was an associate of a drug cartel to hire a team of assassins. And that man turned out to be a confidential informer for the Drug Enforcement Administration, the story said. Keenan noted before imposing the sentence that when Arbabsiar was told that there would probably be 100 to 150 people in the restaurant when it was bombed, he replied, "No problem," or "No big deal," according to a recording of the conversation made secretly by the drug agency’s informer. The story said Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, whose office had sought the maximum 25-year sentence, called Mr. Arbabsiar "an enemy among us — the key conduit for, and facilitator of, a nefarious international plot concocted by members of the Iranian military to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the United States and as many innocent bystanders as necessary to get the job done." Arbabsiar, addressing the judge before he was sentenced, said: "Whatever I did wrong, I take responsibility for it. I can’t change what I did. I have a good heart. I never hurt anyone." He added, "My mind sometimes is not in a good place." Arbabsiar’s lawyer, Sabrina Shroff, a federal public defender, had sought a 10-year term, arguing that her client’s crime had been the result of a longstanding, untreated bipolar disorder, the story said. Iran denies involvement The Times story also said the Iranian government had denied it had anything to do with the plot. An Oct. 12, 2011, CNN news account said an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, Ramin Mehmanparast, had told the semi-official Iranian Students News Agency: "Iran strongly denies the untrue and baseless allegations over a plan to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to Washington." The CNN story also quoted members of President Barack Obama’s administration saying the plot had involved Iran. The story said Vice President Joe Biden had told NBC News: "Every nation in the world, when they learn the facts of this, will be outraged that (Iran) would violate such an international norm, in addition to obviously being a crime to assassinate anybody, and in the process probably have killed scores of Americans" who may have been in the restaurant at the time of a detonation. Also, CNN reported, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., then the chair of the Senate Armed Intelligence Committee, said after getting briefed that there was no doubt that Iran’s Quds Force was involved in the reported plot, though she could not say if higher levels of Iran’s government were too. "I could surmise that the Quds Force would not have done this without the highest levels of approval from the Revolutionary Guard and, most likely, from some higher elements of the government," Feinstein said. But, she added, she could not specify who might have known. She also added that the alleged plot may have been just one in a series of such schemes. "It's hard for me to believe that there is just one plot involving the United States," she said. Our ruling McCaul said Iran’s "regime is responsible for more than 1,000 American casualties during the Iraq war" and "has plotted a terrorist attack here in our nation's capital." McCaul has backing for this statement, although it needs clarification. To our query, a military spokesman stopped short of confirming the number of injuries the Pentagon associates with allegedly Iranian-connected explosives and Iran (perhaps unbelievably) has denied any connection to the Texas-tied plot to hire a hit man to plant a bomb in Washington, D.C.

pomt-00299	Says Richard Cordray’s "plan would allow drug dealers to remain on our streets."	false	/ohio/statements/2018/sep/26/mike-dewine/mike-dewine-misleads-about-issue-1-drug-amendment-/	Republican Mike DeWine says Democrat Richard Cordray is soft on drug dealers in Ohio, a state hit hard by the opioid crisis. "Cordray’s plan would allow drug dealers to remain on our streets," says DeWine’s TV ad. "Even when they are caught with enough fentanyl to kill 10,000 people. The same drug that is killing Ohioans every day. Cordray’s plan would create a safe haven for drug dealers." The ad refers to Corday’s support for Issue 1, a constitutional amendment that would reduce possession offenses to misdemeanors. DeWine, the attorney general, opposes the amendment. The question will appear on the November ballot when DeWine and Cordray face off for governor. We found that DeWine miscasts what the amendment would do and omits what Cordray has said about drug dealers. Key takeaways: • This isn’t "Cordray’s plan," although he supports the amendment. • Cordray has said drug dealers should serve long sentences. • The amendment reduces possession of drugs to a misdemeanor. • The amendment states that drug trafficking would remain a felony. Issue 1 on November ballot If adopted, the amendment would reclassify drug possession -- including fentanyl -- as a misdemeanor and prohibit jail time until an individual's third offense within two years. Also, those already convicted of possession could ask a court to reduce their conviction to a misdemeanor. Felons, with some exceptions for certain offenses, could get a 25 percent reduction in prison time if they participate in rehabilitative, work or educational programs. Money that is saved from imprisonment would go toward rehabilitation and crime victim funds. But the amendment doesn’t let drug traffickers, a.k.a. dealers, off the hook. It states that the misdemeanor provisions "do not apply to convictions for the sale, distribution, or trafficking of drugs" or for convictions based on volume or weight that were classified as a first-, second-, or third-degree felony offense. That leaves fourth- and fifth-degree felony possessions to be reclassified misdemeanors, which the DeWine campaign says would include fentanyl, which is deadly in small amounts. DeWine’s campaign points to an op-ed against the amendment by Chief Justice of the Ohio Supreme Court Maureen O’Connor who said an offender charged with possession of 19 grams of fentanyl would only receive a misdemeanor. Since the lethal dose of fentanyl is just 2 milligrams, 19 grams of fentanyl is enough to kill about 10,000 people, she wrote. But the key here is the word "possession." Defendants who deal drugs can still be charged with felony trafficking, said Ohio State University Law professor Doug Berman, executive director of the Drug Enforcement and Policy Center. "This is not about giving drug dealers a break; this is about freeing up resources to provide treatment to reduce the demand for the drugs," Berman said. The amendment will make prosecutors jobs harder -- they will no longer be able to only charge defendants with possession and send them to prison. Instead, they will have to prove trafficking, which involves additional elements beyond just merely possession -- and would mean that prosecutors would be putting their undercover officers on the stand. Ohio Prosecuting Attorneys Association argues the amendment may prevent felony charges for traffickers "who deliberately deal in small amounts so that they can assert simple possession as a defense." Kenneth R. Bailey , president of the Ohio Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, said someone caught with a small amount of fentanyl could be charged with misdemeanor possession. But DeWine still isn’t telling the full story. "In practice, trafficking is an often used companion charge to possession," Bailey said. "If Issue 1 passes, there is nothing that prevents a prosecutor from bringing the misdemeanor possession count with a companion felony trafficking (charge)." Generally, trafficking is not defined by the amount of the drug, but the purpose for which the possessor is going to use the drug, he said. In one case, a defendant was charged with trafficking for 10 grams of heroin and aggravated trafficking for possessing a bag containing less than a gram of heroin and fentanyl. The defense lawyers association is supporting Issue 1 with reservations, including the form of its implementation as an amendment and the removal of judicial discretion. Cordray’s comments about the amendment DeWine’s ad says it is "Cordray’s plan" to let the drug dealers go free. While Cordray has stated support for Issue 1, it isn’t his plan. Advocates collected signatures to place it on the ballot. Also, DeWine is ignoring that Cordray has distinguished between penalties he wants to see for users and drug dealers. Cordray has said, "As governor, I will work with law enforcement to make sure drug dealers are convicted and serve long prison sentences, while people who need substance abuse treatment can get it in our communities." At least 11 states as of January 2018 have lowered some drug possession crimes from a felony to a misdemeanor, said Alison Lawrence, who tracks drug laws for the National Conference of State Legislatures. Our ruling DeWine’s ad says Cordray’s "plan would allow drug dealers to remain on our streets." Issue 1 would lower possession to a misdemeanor and prohibit jail time until an individual's third offense within two years. That could apply to someone in possession of fentanyl, which is deadly in small amounts. Cordray supports the amendment, but it's a far stretch to call it his plan. Most importantly, the amendment still leaves drug trafficking as a felony, and that includes trafficking of fentanyl. Nothing about the proprosal allows drug dealers to remain on the streets if prosecutors prove the charge in a court of law. We rate this claim False.

pomt-07760	"The things I said (during the prank call by a blogger posing as GOP contributor David Koch) are the things I’ve said publicly all along" about the Wisconsin budget debate.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/24/scott-walker/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-says-his-remarks-during/	Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker faced the Madison press corps after an audio recording revealed his conversation with a prankster he thought was billionaire business executive David Koch, the conservative activist and Walker supporter. One reporter asked how state residents could trust Walker given that he told the Koch impersonator he’d "thought about" bringing in agitators to disrupt protests over his budget -- and planned a ruse to get AWOL Senate Democrats back to Madison. Walker downplayed his conversation as routine. "I take phone calls all the time," he said. "I took phone calls from small business owners earlier, from this individual … I actually talked to one of the Senate Democrats over the weekend, hoping they might be interested in finding a way to come back. I’ve talked to individual taxpayers across the state." He added about his conversation with the Koch fake: "But the bottom line is, the things I said are the things I’ve said publicly all along." That caught our ear. In executing the prank, Ian Murphy, the Buffalo, N.Y., blogger posing as Koch, got what sounded like an insider’s-view briefing from Walker during the 20-minute chat. To be sure, in the call Walker covered a lot of ground familiar to anyone following the budget showdown. Walker press secretary Cullen Werwie told us the same thing. The governor "has consistently talked about getting Democrats to come back to Wisconsin and do their job, which he did in the call as well," Werwie wrote in an e-mail. "He has consistently talked about need for civil discourse. He has consistently talked about the need to make long term, historic decisions that will effect future generations." Let’s take a look. Walker told the caller about his threat of laying off state workers, one he made publicly on multiple occasions earlier in the week, and of a plan to block the Senate Democrats getting paychecks through automatic deposit, also discussed publicly. He had also has made clear in recent days that he would not negotiate or budge from his plan to sharply curtail collective bargaining rights for state employees. He told the fake Koch the same thing. But several other items in the Walker-blogger conversation stood out. We asked Werwie if he could show that the governor had previously talked publicly about these topics Walker covered during the phone call: -- Ronald Reagan: Walker recounted how, as he prepared to release his plan, he took inspiration from Reagan, who fired air-traffic controllers after an illegal strike. Walker said his budget plan could "change the course of history" in Wisconsin just as Reagan’s stance -- in Walker’s view -- had branded the president as tough and led to the fall of communism. -- Planting troublemakers at protests: The fake Koch told Walker he was thinking about "planting troublemakers" at the pro-union rallies. Walker said "we thought about that" but rejected it because it might backfire if "there’s a ruckus caused that would scare the public into thinking maybe the governor has to settle to avoid all these problems." -- Dealing with the Democrats: Walker said during the call he would agree to speak with Democratic legislative leaders if all 14 senators return to Madison. He said he believes if Democrats return to the Capitol, the Senate would have a quorum and could approve the budget-repair bill - even if Democrats again left before the vote was called. -- Asking "Koch" for help: Walker asks for support of the "guys" -- an apparent reference to GOP lawmakers from political swing districts who are worried about how the union vote will play at home. The message needs to get out "over and over" in those districts, Walker said. It’s not clear if Walker means TV ads. Walker told reporters he was not referring to political campaign messages. Koch is the chief backer of Americans for Prosperity, which on Feb. 23, 2011, announced it was spending $342,200 on advertising to persuade Wisconsin residents to back Walker's plan. Werwie took issue with any portrayal of Walker as agreeing to the ruse involving Democrats, or any suggestion that Walker was coordinating political campaign messages with the man he thought was Koch. Regarding Walker’s talk of making history like Reagan, Werwie said Walker "has consistently talked about the need to make long term, historic decisions that will effect future generations." But Werwie did not provide any evidence that Walker had spoken publicly about President Reagan and the air traffic controllers union, the specific plan to lure senators back, the consideration of planting agitators at protests or discussions about outside "message" help for GOP lawmakers. We did our own search of news archives. George Will, the conservative commentator for the Washington Post, drew the Walker-Reagan comparison in regard to the air traffic controllers strike in 1981. He interviewed Walker for a column that ran Feb. 21. He does not quote Walker making the comparison; it is written as Will’s observation. We tried but couldn’t reach Will or Werwie as to whether Walker mentioned he was inspired by Reagan’s actions in the controllers strike. In a New York Times profile on Feb. 20, Walker said he drew inspiration from Reagan because Reagan "didn’t flinch." The story does not indicate the context of that quote. As for the plan to get Democrats to return from self-imposed exile in Illinois, we could find no new accounts about Walker and the GOP considering the ruse he discusses on the audio of the phone call. On the issue of outside "troublemakers," we could find no news accounts of Wisconsin Republicans considering this tactic. Walker, in his Feb. 22 fireside chat, had pointed at the other side, expressing concern that protesters "pouring in" from other states would affect the civility of the debate. Let’s wind this down. Walker sought to downplay the news value in his phone conversation with the blogger by saying, in essence, there was nothing new. While some of the discussion was old news, the chat did produce some revelations about strategy, tactics and Walker’s view of his actions. So, is Walker right that what was said privately matches what he has consistently said publicly? That rates a False on the Truth-O-Meter.

pomt-02774	"FACT: Repealing Obamacare would be easier than repealing Prohibition."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/dec/09/heritage-foundation/heritage-foundation-tweet-says-repealing-obamacare/	If the whirlwind of news about the bumpy rollout of President Barack Obama’s signature health care law is making you dizzy, maybe it’s time to go for a drink. Maybe at a speakeasy? We had this idea after seeing a tweet sent recently by the Heritage Foundation, the conservative think-tank. Heritage, which opposes the Affordable Care Act, sent a tweet that featured a black-and-white photograph of people celebrating the 21st Amendment, which made it legal to buy, sell, transport and drink alcohol. The caption was: "FACT: Repealing Obamacare would be easier than repealing Prohibition." The tweet seems logical at first glance — after all, Prohibition was a constitutional amendment, while Obama’s health care law is "only" a law. But would it really be easier? Experts say the issue is actually more complicated than it looks. Repealing Prohibition First, let’s go back to 1917, when Congress passed the Volstead Act, a nationwide ban on the sale, production, importation and transportation of alcohol beverages. In 1919, the Volstead Act became the 18th Amendment to the Constitution. During the "dry" period, lasting from 1920 to 1933, organized crime increased significantly. With public support flagging, the 18th Amendment was scuttled after only 13 years, through ratification of the 21st Amendment, on Dec. 5, 1933. The repeal -- as do all repeals of constitutional amendments -- required a two-thirds majority in both the House and the Senate, as well as approval by three quarters of the states. Repealing a constitutional amendment is always "a very difficult path," said Burdett Loomis, a University of Kansas political scientist. "That said, it was a fairly simple piece of policy to reverse, all things considered. Many states immediately changed their policies and legal drinking began right away," Loomis said. All told, it only took eight months to reach enough states -- 36 -- to completely overturn Prohibition. Repealing Obamacare What about repealing Obamacare? In theory, enacting or repealing a law, such as Obamacare, requires a simple majority in both the Senate and the House, followed by a presidential signature. That could happen pretty quickly if all parties were to agree. If both chambers of Congress agreed but president vetoed the bill, then a two-thirds vote is required in both houses. On the surface, then, "repeal of Obamacare appears to be easier than repeal of the 18th Amendment," concluded Steven Smith, a congressional scholar at the Washington University in St. Louis. It doesn’t involve the states at all, and it can be passed by a simple majority if the president agrees. (No constitutional amendment has been ratified since 1992, and the previous one before that was in 1971, suggesting how hard a climb it is.) But repealing a law like Obamacare is hardly a piece of cake. For starters, scholars we interviewed all stressed how complex Obamacare is. The Affordable Care Act has 2,074 pages, a fact Republicans regularly complain about. (Take a look here at our fact-check of the actual length of the bill.) By contrast, the 18th Amendment that enacted Prohibition consists of only three paragraphs. The same goes for the 21st, which repealed it. "The fact that the tweet (from the Heritage Foundation) is missing, is that there are 10 titles to the ACA," said Timothy Jost, a Washington and Lee University law professor. "It’s not only health care, it’s also Medicare, Medicaid, fraud and abuse laws, preventive care laws, etc." In addition, many provisions of Obamacare have already been enacted over the past few years, such as new regulations for medical education and training, preventive care, the right of parents to add children up to 26 years old on their policies, and an end to insurer rejections for pre-existing conditions for children and lifetime caps on medical expenses. "If all of those were repealed, no one knows what would happen to the insured," Jost said. There would also be a risk that any fraud or abuse cases currently prosecuted under the health care laws would also have to be dismissed. In addition, Medicare and Medicaid were modified and expanded as part of Obamacare, and the so-called doughnut hole for Medicare prescription drug coverage was closed. "If you repeal Obamacare and do nothing else, that would probably lead to a stop of all Medicaid payments," Jost said. Length of a possible repeal So let’s say Congress and the president really wanted to go through with a repeal of the health care law. How long would that take? "Responsible legislation repealing Obamacare would be quite long, many hundreds or thousands of times longer than the three sentences of the 21st amendment" needed to repeal Prohibition, political scientist Steven Smith said. Then there’s a whole separate problem: Many states have changed their laws according to the federal health care law, so each of those states would have to be repealed and rewritten as well. If you include all of these factors, Smith concluded, "the repeal of Obamacare legislation would be much more difficult to write than the 21st Amendment." When we ran these critiques by the Heritage Foundation, Hans von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow at the think tank, said he disagreed. "The claim that ‘responsible legislation repealing Obamacare would be quite long’ is ridiculous," Spakovsky said. He argued that it would only take a one-paragraph bill to repeal the health care law in its entirety. "The word ‘responsible’ is the key word that other so-called experts use to dispute this," Spakovsky said. "They clearly believe that parts of Obamacare should be preserved." Our ruling The Heritage Foundation tweeted that it would be easier to repeal Obamacare than it was to repeal Prohibition. It’s correct that, on paper, it’s procedurally easier to repeal a law than to repeal a constitutional amendment. However, Obamacare is a much more complicated piece of legislation than Prohibition was, meaning it would likely be far more complicated to eliminate all vestiges of the law. The Heritage tweet oversimplifies the debate. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.

pomt-14269	Race to the Top grants "require participating states to adopt the Common Core standards as a condition for receiving federal funding."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2016/apr/08/david-jolly/common-core-required-win-obama-grants-us-rep-da/	Looking to take over former presidential candidate Marco Rubio’s soon-to-be-vacant Senate seat, U.S. Rep. David Jolly wants to educate voters about his conservative bona fides in Congress — including his opposition to Common Core. The Indian Shores Republican has been in the House of Representatives for two years after winning a 2014 special election to replace his mentor, the late Rep. C.W. Bill Young. In that short span, he said, he has helped change federal education policy. "Last year, I worked with my colleagues to end funding for federal Race to the Top grants, which require participating states to adopt the Common Core standards as a condition for receiving federal funding," he said on his campaign website. The Common Core State Standards are a set of shared guidelines in English and math designed to prepare students for college and to unify educational goals nationwide. They’ve become an unpopular subject with many conservatives. We decided to test Jolly’s assertion that states had to adopt the Common Core in order to win federal grants. Race to the Top Our lesson begins with a primer on Common Core. In 2007, the Council of Chief State School Officers considered creating state-based standards that could be shared nationwide. The idea was that a high school diploma from Tennessee would then have the same value as one from Idaho or New Mexico. Two years later, the council and the National Governors Association agreed to develop what was called Common Core with input from teachers, parents and education experts. President Barack Obama’s signature education program, Race to the Top, invited states to compete for grant money from the 2009 federal economic stimulus. States had to show they were committed to improving educational standards and performance and implement reforms to win the cash. The final Common Core guidelines came out in 2010, and states could decide to use them or ignore them. Forty-five states decided to accept the standards. Minnesota adopted the English standards, but not the math guidelines. Indiana, Oklahoma and South Carolina agreed to use Common Core at first, but later backed off the plan. Jolly’s assertion is that the application process demanded states adopt Common Core to get a grant. That isn’t the case. Committing to Common Core was not a stipulation of winning a grant, but it did factor into the application process. The Education Department gave states that had adopted a set of standards extra points (40 of a possible 500) when competing for grants. The shorthand was, if you had adopted Common Core, you had a better chance at hitting the federal grant lottery. Jolly’s campaign pointed out the guidelines for the grant process that said applicants had to show a "commitment to adopting a common set of high-quality standards." They reasoned that almost all of the 19 eventual grant winners (including Florida, which won $700 million in August 2010) had adopted Common Core before winning grants. But experts told us there was no demand that states adopt Common Core before Washington would hand over funding. And even then, there was no requirement for actually implementing them. Delaware, for example, won its grant in March 2010, but didn’t adopt Common Core until August of that year. Tennessee also won in March 2010, but adopted them in July of that year. Daniel Thatcher, a senior policy specialist at the National Conference of State Legislatures, said Washington has subsequently been accused of coercing states into adopting Common Core. In 2015, a federal judge rejected former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal’s coercion claims in a lawsuit he brought against the Education Department, which his successor has since ended. Common Core did have supporters in Washington, although they often were careful about not using the term Common Core. But many state legislators and teachers unions and education reformers approved of Common Core at the time, too. (For the record, even Jindal once was a Common Core advocate before changing his mind and suing the federal government.) "For any single state, it's difficult to know whether Race to the Top merely rewarded an applicant for doing something it was already inclined to do, or whether the competition changed behavior in any material way," University of Chicago political science professor William Howell said in an email. He noted the timing of the grants during the recession may have potentially spurred some states into action to shore up finances, leading them to adopt Common Core to get a leg up. "It's hard not to conclude that features of the competition were at least partially responsible," Howell said. Congress stripped funding for Race to the Top state grants out of the spending bill it passed in December 2014. Jolly voted for the measure. His campaign said Jolly helped keep funding out of the following year’s bill after he joined the House Appropriations Committee in January 2015. Obama did not ask for Race to the Top funding in his FY 2016 budget proposal. The remaining funds for the grant program expired in September 2015. In December 2015, Jolly also voted in favor of the Every Student Succeeds Act. That bill, signed by Obama, specifically said the Secretary of Education "shall not attempt to influence, incentivize, or coerce State adoption of the Common Core State Standards." Our ruling Jolly said Race to the Top grants "require participating states to adopt the Common Core standards as a condition for receiving federal funding." Adopting education guidelines — Common Core or otherwise — was an element of a state’s overall application score and would add to point totals. Common Core critics have since accused Washington of coercing states. But there was no concrete requirement to adopt standards in exchange for grant money. Experts told us the promise of federal money during the recession may have spurred Common Core adoption in some places, but there’s no way to know that for sure. We rate Jolly’s statement Mostly False.	None	David Jolly	None	None	None	2016-04-08T11:00:00	2016-04-04	['None']
pomt-01877	An image of nine white, blond women shows "the amazing diversity of Fox News anchors."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/09/facebook-posts/facebook-post-blondes-fox-news/	For several years, this image has made the rounds on social media. We found it recently on the photo page of a San Francisco area journalist, Jamal Dajani. "The amazing diversity of Fox News anchors," Dajani wrote in a post that had been shared nearly 12,000 times by July 9, 2014. The image, Dajani told us, "reflects the uniformity of the Fox narrative -- one dimensional." In this case, the nine images are all of white women with blond hair. It's not a new dig at Fox News. Saturday Night Live mocked Fox News' lack of diversity in 2010, referring to a guest only as "attractive blonde lady" in a sketch. But with the revival of this Facebook image, we wanted to see if the criticism holds water. We can't verify that all nine people pictured are Fox News anchors or hosts (matching images can be dicey). But we can check how closely the Facebook image matches the full line-up of Fox News female personalities. We went through the Fox News website and picked out all the women with anchor or host in their job description (rotating anchor and co-host qualified). For the record, Fox News has plenty of male hosts, too, but we decided to look only at women since that was the focus of the Facebook image. Fox News female hosts and anchors' hair color We realize deciding whether a person’s hair is or isn’t blond can be a judgment call. But we included the images of each host so you can reach your own conclusion. Of the 26 female hosts and anchors listed on the Fox News website, by our count roughly about half are blond and half are not. That's not nearly how the Facebook image had it. Fox News female hosts and anchors' race As you can see from the images above, the majority of Fox News' female on-air talent is white. But they are not universally white. Arthel Neville is African-American and Uma Pemmaraju describes herself as the first Indian-American anchor to regularly appear on national television. Our ruling A Facebook post used an image of female Fox News anchors to say that the network lacks diversity in its staff. We found that for those women who are anchors or hosts in any capacity, about half are blond. And while most are white, not all are. The Facebook image gives the strong impression that all female Fox News anchors and hosts look alike. That's misleading. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-02651	"I started the whole year" as a senior on the University of Illinois football team and "led the team in interceptions and tackles from defensive back."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2014/jan/15/scott-turner/scott-turner-house-speaker-hopeful-didnt-lead-coll/	A first-term Texas legislator recently revisited his youthful determination to become a professional football player. State Rep. Scott Turner, R-Frisco, speaking Jan. 8, 2014, at a Texas Public Policy Foundation conference in Austin, said he made it to the NFL despite being sidelined through his first three seasons as a student-athlete at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Turner, lately an aspirant for speaker of the Texas House, said he thrived as a player only after agreeing to switch from offensive positions to defensive back. Referring to his senior season, Turner said: "I started the whole year, led the team in interceptions and tackles from defensive back." That’s quite an accomplishment in that many defenders can pile up tackles and interceptions. We were curious. The online 2013 Illinois Football Record Book from the university does not show Turner leading the Fighting Illini in tackles or interceptions in any seasons. At our request, Derek Neal, a University of Illinois spokesman, checked the football program’s "archive book" for the 1994 season. By phone, Neal confirmed that Turner started each of that season’s games at cornerback but said other players led the team in tackles and interceptions. Turner had 48 tackles, Neal said. Seven players had more: three linebackers, two safeties, a defensive end and defensive tackle. Dana Howard, a linebacker, led with 150 tackles, he said. Turner had two interceptions that season, Neal said, as did three other players. Another cornerback, Robert Crumpton, led the team with four interceptions, Neal said. After we obtained these figures, Turner told us he’d intended to indicate that he led players at his position--cornerback--in tackles and interceptions; he said by phone that he’d forgotten he trailed a fellow cornerback in interceptions. "I know that defensive backs never lead the team in tackles. If you do, that’s a horrible team... If I misspoke, obviously, I apologize for that," Turner said. "I don’t need to embellish the truth. I played." Our ruling Turner said he started every game of his senior season, leading the team in tackles and interceptions from defensive back. Turner indeed started every game. But he finished eighth in tackles and tied for second in interceptions with several players. He also did not lead defensive backs in either category. We rate this claim as Mostly False.

pomt-10064	Democrats have said that "even one hearing (on the stimulus bill) would be one too many, and that we have a single day to approve these five complex propositions that will affect the lives of millions."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jan/26/joe-barton/Congress-getting-little-review-of-stimulus-bill/	When Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, complained this week that Democrats were ramming the proposed $835 billion economic stimulus package too quickly through Congress, he was hardly charting new territory as far as minority party gripes. The "you're not giving us reasonable time to debate this important legislation" is a well-worn minority party refrain. But we wondered whether Barton was accurate when he said the House Energy and Commerce Committee has not — and will not — hold a single hearing on a major portion of the $850 billion stimulus plan that came before it. Here's what Barton said on Jan. 22: "While I understand the majority’s desire to move quickly on the stimulus package, I think the short leash that the speaker has put us on restricts our ability to write competent legislation. We have not had a single hearing on anything in front of us, meaning that the only opinion we’ve heard on the expenditure of billions of dollars is that of the speaker. We’ve been told that even one hearing would be one too many, and that we have a single day to approve these five complex propositions that will affect the lives of millions. That’s because the speaker wants the entire stimulus package on the House floor next week. “By my count, in front of us are 269 pages of text. I have not yet seen the most recent CBO score, but suffice it to say that these 269 pages approve the spending of hundreds of billions of dollars. Will this package of legislation waste money? Will it abuse people? Will it raise a dust cloud of unintended and unhappy consequences? Will we be embarrassed by some of what we approve here today? The answer is yes, yes, yes and yes." The portion of the stimulus plan that came before Energy and Commerce Committee includes about $170 billion in proposed spending. No one challenges the claim that the massive spending bill is being fast-tracked. At a congressional forum on Jan. 7, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi explained the urgency this way: "Nothing could be clearer than the fact that we need action and we need action now. A failure to act quickly can only lead to more job losses and more economic pain for Americans. If we act boldly and rapidly, we can begin to create new jobs and opportunities today and strengthen our economy, as you said, for the long run." President Obama has said he wants to have the package approved by mid February. Republicans have cried foul, saying there has been little effort by Democrats to craft a bipartisan package, and that they only received a draft of the proposal on Jan. 16. Less than a week later, the plan came before the House Appropriations, Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce committees, for one day of "markups." That means committee members can propose amendments. On Jan. 22, Barton's Energy and Commerce Committee, on which he is the senior Republican, held a marathon 12-hour "markup" session during which numerous amendments were added to the proposal. The fate of amendments largely depended on which side of the aisle the suggestions came from, as nearly all of the dozens of Republican-backed amendments were rejected. Don Ritchie, associate historian of the Senate Historical Office, said while congressional committees are typically permitted hearings on major spending plans, "when there's an emergency, they tend not to go along in regular order. ... When the leadership of both houses agrees it's important enough to circumvent, then they'll go around the regular order." The minority party almost always objects, he said, but both parties have done it when they control the majority. "It's not unprecedented by any means," Ritchie said of bypassing hearings. But it is unusual for such a large spending plan. "There hasn't been anything of that magnitude in a long time," Ritchie said. "That stands out by itself, I think." Barton used words like "abomination" and "truly an insult" to describe the fast-tracking of the plan. By way of explaining the need for a streamlined review, Committee Chairman Rep. Henry A. Waxman said, "We are in a deep and long recession. Our unemployment rate is over 7 percent and growing. We urgently need an economic recovery package — and we need it immediately." On Jan. 23, Obama met with Republican leadership to get their input on the proposed stimulus package; and he agreed to meet with the Republican caucuses this week, though many Republicans scoffed at the suggestion it will result in anything close to a bipartisan plan. One can argue whether the urgency of the economic crisis outweighs the need for deliberate consideration through congressional hearings, but Barton is right: There have been no hearings on the massive stimulus package that Congress is expected to vote on as early as this week.

pomt-09406	"In Texas, schools do not even have to teach sex education."	true	/texas/statements/2010/mar/20/pat-carlson/texas-eagle-forum-says-texas-schools-dont-have-tea/	While making a case for abstinence-only sex education, the right-leaning Texas Eagle Forum recently declared that sex isn't a mandated topic in Texas schools. The group states in its March 11 "News & Notes" e-mail blast: "In Texas, schools do not even have to teach sex education." Teaching the birds and bees, optional? "In my understanding, it's a local level decision," said Pat Carlson of Fort Worth, the forum's Texas president. She pointed us to the state's education code, which requires each school district's board of trustees to establish a local school health advisory council, with at least five members, including parents, clergy and law enforcement officials. The council makes recommendations on the health curriculum taught in the district's schools. An excerpt from the law: "Any course materials and instruction relating to human sexuality, sexually transmitted diseases, or human immunodeficiency virus or acquired immune deficiency syndrome shall be selected by the board of trustees with the advice of the local school health advisory council." The law further states that "before each school year, a school district shall provide written notice to a parent of each student enrolled in the district of the board of trustees' decision regarding whether the district will provide human sexuality instruction to district students." Whether the district will provide human sexuality instruction? That doesn't sound like a requirement. However, schools do have to follow the state board of education's curriculum standards — Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills — according to a spokeswoman at the Texas Education Agency, which oversees primary and secondary public education. And that curriculum requires health teachers to teach sex education at appropriate grade levels. The state's guidelines for health classes state that in grades 9-10, for example, "the student analyzes the relationship between unsafe behaviors and personal health and develops strategies to promote resiliency throughout the life span." The student is expected to explore "the relationship between the use of refusal skills and the avoidance of unsafe situations such as sexual abstinence... the importance and benefits of abstinence as it relate to emotional health and the prevention of pregnancy and sexually-transmitted diseases... discuss abstinence from sexual activity as the only method that is 100 percent effective in preventing pregnancy," and so forth. On the one hand, it sounds like local school districts can opt out of teaching sex ed. On the other, it sounds like they're required to spell out the particulars. There's another wrinkle. Last year, state lawmakers voted to no longer require high-school students to take a health course to graduate. But a TEA spokeswoman told us schools are still required to offer the course. Confused? Apparently, so is the state education agency. "It's clear as mud, " said David Anderson, the agency's legal counsel. "There is some ambiguity that a school district has to teach parts of the state curriculum about human sexuality." Anderson explained the history of this issue this way: "When the curriculum was first written in 1995 — foundation curriculum and enrichment curriculum — and districts had to teach all of the foundation curriculum, like algebra, they did not have to teach every part of the enrichment curriculum. That's where health was." Anderson noted that Attorney General Dan Morales issued an advisory opinion in 1998 stating that local school districts control the teaching of human sexuality in any enrichment curriculum (fine arts, foreign languages, technology, and health and physical education) — meaning school districts could choose not to teach sex ed. Anderson said lawmakers later amended state law to require districts to teach everything spelled out in state curriculum standards. Despite that change, Anderson said, local districts still control what — if anything — is taught about human sexuality. "It's at least an open question if a school board is required to teach some part of the health curriculum which some people might regard as sex education," Anderson said. "My guess is districts are making their (sex education) decisions locally and people are happy with that." The only unquestioned mandate that school districts must meet, said Anderson, is the parenting and paternity awareness program taught as part of high-school health classes. He added, "But I'm not sure everyone would think that means sex ed." We asked the attorney general's office to weigh in. Its spokesman, Jerry Strickland, declined, saying: "We don't provide legal opinions lightly; because of that, this would truly be an issue for TEA." When we asked Anderson plainly if schools are required to teach sex education, he said: "It's not a yes or no answer." How's this for clarity? If the responsible state agency cannot answer "yes," there is no requirement. We rate Carlson's statement as True.	None	Pat Carlson	None	None	None	2010-03-20T17:12:45	2010-03-11	['Texas']

"BREAKING: Queen Elizabeth II Dead At 94," said a May 9 headline by The Liberty Raise. The story appears to be copied from The Daily World Update, a website that purports to be satire. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. You can read more about our partnership with Facebook here. The story claimed that the queen died of a stroke in her home in Windsor. According to the story, the queen was awake throughout the stroke and managed to give some parting advice: "Don’t trust Donald Trump."

There is no truth to this headline or story. First off, the queen is 92 years old, not 94. But more importantly, the queen is not dead. If the queen had died, it would be reported by legitimate news outlets, like the BBC or the Guardian. And there would likely be a post about it in press releases of the official website of the British Royal family (which is teeming with news about the birth of Prince Louis and the impending nuptials of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry). In reality, on the same day this hoax published, the queen was actually at the Royal Windsor Horse Show where she was pictured smiling. When the queen does pass away, it will be the "most disruptive event in Britain in the last 70 years," according to Business Insider. "For at least 12 days — between her passing, the funeral and beyond — Britain will grind to a halt," the article said. "It'll cost the British economy billions in lost earnings." There was one recent death in the royal family: the queen’s dog, Willow. Willow, the 14-year old corgi was put down in April following a battle with cancer.

pomt-03235	Sen. Marco Rubio "refuses to accept the basic science" on climate change and is "a climate change denier."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/16/organizing-action/group-backing-barack-obama-says-marco-rubio-climat/	In a recent email to supporters in Florida, Organizing for Action -- a group that supports President Barack Obama -- criticized the climate change policies of Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., one of the Senate’s leading Republicans and a possible 2016 presidential contender. The email, signed by Ivan Frishberg, the group’s climate campaign manager, begins like this: "Friend -- "We're spending the next week of Action August getting serious about climate change. "To get ready, we're calling out Sen. Marco Rubio, who refuses to accept the basic science on this issue -- and is standing in the way of action. "It's time everyone in Florida knows: Sen. Rubio is a climate change denier." The email goes on to say that "there are 135 documented climate change deniers currently roaming the halls of Congress." The full list is here, but in this item we’ll be focusing on whether Rubio "is a climate change denier." We should clarify up front: In the policy context, the term "climate change" refers to rising temperatures and sea levels caused by human beings and their use of carbon-dioxide-emitting fossil fuels. (We should also note that Rubio’s staff did not respond when contacted for this story.) In supporting its claim, OFA cites a Feb. 13, 2010, article in the Tampa Tribune. According to the Tribune, Rubio called his then-Senate opponent Charlie Crist "a believer in man-made global warming" and said, "I don't think there's the scientific evidence to justify it." Asked whether he accepts scientific evidence that the global climate is undergoing change, Rubio responded, "The climate is always changing. The climate is never static. The question is whether it's caused by man-made activity and whether it justifies economically destructive government regulation." After trying to locate as many of Rubio’s comments on climate change as we could, we concluded that the Tribune story is indeed the strongest evidence OFA can use to support its labeling of Rubio as a "climate change denier." Rubio’s language to the Tribune is pretty clear: He doesn’t think there’s sufficient scientific evidence to support the claim that the climate is changing due to human factors. However, on other occasions -- both before and after the Tribune interview -- Rubio has offered somewhat more nuanced opinions on the topic. Initially, when he was speaker of the Florida House, Rubio seemed to tacitly support the idea that the earth’s temperatures were rising, even as he sometimes differed with environmentalists over specific policy options. While Rubio was speaker in 2008, the House unanimously passed a law ordering the state Department of Environmental Protection to develop rules for companies to limit their emissions of carbon dioxide, a pollutant that scientists say may be contributing to global warming. In a 2007 speech to fellow legislators, Rubio urged his state to become a Silicon Valley of the new energy-technology economy. "Global warming, dependence on foreign sources of fuel, and capitalism have come together to create opportunities for us that were unimaginable just a few short years ago," he said. "Today, Florida has the opportunity to pursue bold energy policies, not just because they’re good for our environment, but because people can actually make money doing it. This nation and ultimately the world is headed toward emission caps and energy diversification." By phrasing it this way, without any effort to question the scientific underpinnings of global warming, Rubio suggested that he tacitly supported the science behind global warming. He made the same implication when he wrote in a 2007 Miami Herald op-ed, "Whether motivated by global warming or geopolitics, there is widespread support for diversifying our energy portfolio and becoming more efficient in our use of energy." By Dec. 10, 2009, Rubio was openly hedging his position on climate change science. Confronted with accusations that he had flip-flopped on climate change, Rubio told the Miami Herald, "I'm not a scientist. I'm not qualified to make that decision. There's a significant scientific dispute about that.'' Rubio’s next flurry of comments on climate change came in 2013, after he had become a leading figure in the national GOP. Here are Rubio’s recent comments: • BuzzFeed interview, Feb. 5, 2013: In a video interview with the website BuzzFeed, Rubio said, "The United States is a country, not a planet. On the other hand, if we unilaterally impose these sorts of things on our economy, you could have a devastating impact on economics. ... There has to be a cost-benefit analysis to every one of these principles people are pushing on. … The climate’s always changing -- that’s not the fundamental question. The fundamental question is whether man-made activity is what’s contributing most to it. I know people said there’s a significant scientific consensus on that issue, but I’ve actually seen reasonable debate on that principle." • Republican response to the State of the Union address, Feb. 12, 2013. Responding to Obama’s speech, Rubio said, "When we point out that no matter how many job-killing laws we pass, our government can’t control the weather – he accuses us of wanting dirty water and dirty air." • Fox and Friends interview, Feb. 13, 2013. The day after his response to the State of the Union address, Rubio said, "The government can’t change the weather. I said that in the speech. We can pass a bunch of laws that will destroy our economy, but it isn’t going to change the weather. Because, for example, there are other countries that are polluting in the atmosphere much greater than we are at this point -- China, India, all these countries that are still growing. They’re not going to stop doing what they’re doing. America is a country, it’s not a planet. So we can pass a bunch of laws or executive orders that will do nothing to change the climate or the weather but will devastate our economy -- devastate it." • Statement on his Senate Web page, posted June 25, 2013: In response to a speech in which Obama outlined a series of measures on climate change that he could accomplish by executive order, Rubio said: "This time, President Obama is discarding the Constitution and free enterprise system in the name of a job-killing environmental agenda. We must do everything we can to stand in his way." In these comments, Rubio expressed strong opposition to Obama’s climate change policies, particularly on the grounds that the benefits would not exceed the costs. And he seemed to exude skepticism that climate change was an urgent policy concern, as well as the sentiment that human actions cannot change something as massive as the weather. Still, in these comments, Rubio never explicitly denied the science behind climate change, as he did three years earlier in the Tribune interview. In fact, in the BuzzFeed conversation, Rubio conceded that "I’ve actually seen reasonable debate on that principle." Someone who is a "denier" does not typically concede that his opponents may have a "reasonable" point. Our ruling Organizing for Action said that Rubio "refuses to accept the basic science" on climate change and is "a climate change denier." Rubio’s 2010 comments to the Tampa Tribune -- when he said, "I don't think there's the scientific evidence to justify it" -- represent the clearest evidence in support of the group’s charge. In that comment, Rubio does sound like he is denying the existence of science that supports the climate change hypothesis. Since then -- including on four separate occasions this year -- Rubio has expressed opposition to climate change policies while speaking more cautiously about the science that proves climate change is happening. On one of those occasions in February, he even conceded that he’s seen "reasonable debate" about the question. But in none of those instances did Rubio walk back his 2010 remarks, even though he had several opportunities to do so. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-05074	The Wisconsin Retirement System for public employees is "a self-funded pension plan" and "it’s the money of the workers’ that funds it."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jul/04/afscme/labor-leader-marty-beil-says-state-pension-plan-se/	Gov. Scott Walker fueled fears in some state government workers about pension security when he initiated a study that public-sector unions saw as a step toward a 401(k)-style plan they see as less secure. When the study came out July 2, 2012, it recommended against adding an optional "defined contribution" plan to the state pension system, and Walker said he was not "currently" planning "substantial" changes. Some conservative critics have decried the guaranteed pensions in the current "defined benefit" plan, while defenders noted the best-in-the-nation fiscal health of the Wisconsin Retirement System. On June 14, 2012 the state’s highest-profile public employee labor leader, Marty Beil, talked pensions during an appearance on the liberal "Sly in the Morning" radio show on Madison’s WTDY radio. Beil, executive director of District Council 24 of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), said "we have pensions here that are not out of line. We have pensions that don’t put huge amounts of economic burden on the taxpayers." Beil went on: "It’s really the employees’ money, and that has to be told, and has to be told to legislators, to neighbors and friends -- that this really is a self-funded pension plan. It’s the money of the workers’ that funds it." In 2010, the state pension system paid out some $3.9 billion. That’s a lot of cash. Is Beil right that the system is "self funded" by employee contributions and "it’s the money of the workers that funds it?" About the system We started with data compiled by the state Department of Employee Trust Funds, which administers the retirement plan for 166,000 retirees and 260,000 active workers. For 2010, the latest year available, revenues flowing into the pension fund totalled $9.78 billion -- 85 percent of which came from investment returns on the fund. That’s pretty typical of the fund’s experience. Over the past decade, except for a couple years when stock market losses wiped out any revenue gain, investment income has averaged 76 percent of the annual revenue. But what about all the money that generated the returns? When and where did it come from? For 2010, nearly all of the remaining 15 percent came from the employers who are part of the fund -- the state, school districts and most local units of government, based on collective bargaining agreements. But, wait, didn’t Walker limit collective bargaining and require the state and its employees to begin making identical contributions to the fund? Yes, but that didn’t kick in until 2011, so it has had little impact on the sources of the $77 billion in the fund, and it had no impact on the fund as of 2010. What’s relevant for this fact check is what the law was before Act 10. Here’s the history on where contributions to the fund came from. Dating to at least the 1940s, Wisconsin law has made both workers and the state responsible for contributing to the pension fund in amounts based on flat percentages or actuarial calculations related to keeping the fund healthy. Indeed, the state’s books still show a cost-sharing arrangement. But the statutes, since at least 1981, have allowed or dictated that the state cover some or all of the workers’ contributions in addition to the employer share. This was the era of collective bargaining. And that’s what happened. It became commonplace over a period of decades for almost all public employers -- the state, school districts, local governments -- to "pick up" the entire employee contribution. So, looking simply at the numbers, it’s clear the vast majority of funds in the pension system are from investment returns and taxpayer-funded contributions by employers. By that measure, Beil’s claim of a "self funded" pension system is way off the mark, given that few employees were making a direct contribution to the fund before 2011. Another high-ranking AFSCME official in Wisconsin, Susan McMurray, a lobbyist with AFSCME Council 11, agreed that "self funded" is not an accurate description. "It doesn’t really work like that," she said. "It’s not a 401(k). It’s a different mechanism." Keith Brainard, research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators, agreed: "The pension is an important part of compensation, but to say the employer is not contributing to the cost, that’s not really defensible." More to the story But that’s not the end of the story. Pensions are an integral part of an employee’s compensation package. In effect, it is money set aside now to be available when the worker retires. "It’s not like they’re giving it to us," said McMurray, who spoke for Beil. This point of view was advocated during the original collective bargaining debate by financial journalist David Cay Johnston. "The money the state ‘contributes’ is actually part of the compensation that has been negotiated with state workers in advance so it is their money that they choose to take as pension payments in the future rather than cash wages or other benefits today," Johnston wrote in a 2011 article for Tax.com. Others argue the exact opposite. "One could equally say that 100 percent of Wisconsin pensions are funded by taxpayers, since taxpayers are the sole source of income for public sector workers, including the portion of their salaries that are deducted to meet pension contributions," The Economist magazine’s Buttonwood column argued in February 2011. Asked if unions feel they gave up the same amount in foregone wage increases as they received in pension improvements, AFSCME’s McMurray said they have not documented the relationship. Joshua Rauh, a Northwestern University finance professor who tracks pension costs, told us he doubted any serious economist would dispute the tradeoff, but the extent of the wage giveback is debatable. "The answer is certainly not that 100 percent of the benefit was paid for by employees through lower wages," he said. If the system is "self-funded" as Biel claimed, what happens when investment returns lag? Critics say the taxpayer is on the hook when contributions are required beyond beyond those funded in the planned compensation package. In reality that hasn’t happened -- but only because the laws were written so that the employer contribution was open-ended. It’s important to note that in bad times, many retirees get a smaller pension, too -- unlike pensioners in other states. Our rating Beil said the Wisconsin Retirement System for public employees is "a self-funded pension plan" and "it’s the money of the workers’ that funds it." There’s an element of truth in his statement, in that workers for years made trade-offs in collective bargaining that to some unknown extent paid for the pension contribution their employers agreed to pick up. Even the state’s accounting system continued to show an annual worker contribution. But Beil’s "self-funded" remark leaves the strong misimpression that taxpayers have little or no skin in the game, when, in fact, taxpayers have been the major source of the money in the pension fund. We rate Biel’s claim Mostly False.	None	AFSCME	None	None	None	2012-07-04T09:00:00	2012-06-14	['None']
pomt-12103	"We have become an energy exporter for the first time ever just recently."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/aug/23/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrongly-says-us-net-energy-exporte/	In a 75-minute rally speech that revisited his response to the Charlottesville, Va., unrest and scolded the national media, President Donald Trump slid in a note of pride about the United States’ balance of trade in energy. "We're going to do an infrastructure bill," Trump said. "We will build gleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways, waterways, all across our beautiful land. Our greatest creations, our most incredible buildings, our most beautiful works of art are just waiting to be brought to life. American hands will build this future. American energy will power this future. We have become an energy exporter for the first time ever just recently." Was he correct to say that the United States has "become an energy exporter for the first time ever just recently"? Short answer: No. But to get to the short answer, you have to wade through several possible interpretations of what Trump meant. (The White House did not clarify his meaning for us.) First possible meaning: The U.S. has just begun exporting energy One way to read Trump’s statement is to take it literally -- that the United States only recently began to export energy. This is flat wrong. "We have been exporting coal, natural gas, electricity, refined products and energy technologies for a very long time," said Paul Sullivan, a professor at National Defense University and an adjunct professor at Georgetown University who specializes in energy security issues. "We were once, during the time of JD Rockefeller, the world's near monopoly on kerosene. Liquefied natural gas exports from Alaska to Japan have been around for a long time. Piped gas to Mexico and Canada are normal events. We have a massive electricity trade with Canada." Second possible meaning: The U.S. is now a net energy exporter Trump might have meant that the United States had only recently become a net exporter of energy -- meaning the total of all U.S. energy exports recently overtook the total of all U.S. energy imports. This is less wrong, but still not accurate. "This has been falling, but we are still a huge net energy importer," said Jason Bordoff, who directs Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. In its most recent projections, the federal Energy Information Administration concluded that the United States would become a net energy exporter around 2026, depending on the course of future patterns of global supply, demand and pricing. What’s clear is that the United States has not yet become a net exporter of energy, as Trump’s past-tense remark indicated. If that day comes in 2026 -- and it may or may not -- that would be two years after Trump finishes a possible second term. Third possible meaning: U.S. crude oil export ban lifted Perhaps rather than "energy," Trump meant to say "crude oil." If this is what Trump meant, the statement would still be problematic. It wouldn’t be the first time "ever." And the relevant change was signed under his predecessor, President Barack Obama. On Dec. 18, 2015, the United States enacted legislation to repeal a ban on most crude-oil exports that had been in place since the energy-crisis days of 1975. (Exports of refined petroleum were not blocked by the law, just crude.) Here’s a chart showing U.S. crude-oil exports going back to the 1980s. (The years between 1975 and 2015 show some export activity because trade with some countries, such as Canada, was exempt from the law.) The rapid rise in crude-oil exports near the end of the chart reflects the lifting of the export-restriction law. Other possible meanings It’s possible to substitute any number of energy subcategories into Trump’s remark to see whether they make the statement more accurate. Some do, some don’t. The United States has been a net coal exporter for many years. It has been a net exporter of refined petroleum products since around 2011. So neither of those would make Trump correct. Natural gas is a more promising option. The United States is not yet a net exporter of natural gas, but the difference between imports and exports has narrowed for nine consecutive years, according to EIA, falling to its smallest gap ever in 2016. And the agency projects that the United States will become a net exporter of natural gas once the 2017 numbers are tallied up. Energy experts say that this is a significant development, though one that Trump can take little credit for. "It has been a trend that was activated by the U.S. shale boom and made possible by the Obama administration's policy on liquefied natural gas exports," said Anna Mikulska, a fellow with Rice University’s Center for Energy Studies. Ironically, Bordoff added, a different Trump policy goal -- reviewing Obama-era increases in fuel-efficiency standards for vehicles -- could make it harder for the United States to become a net exporter of energy, the very thing he applauded in Phoenix. "Trump’s stated intention to ease fuel economy standards actually undermines the goal of becoming a net energy exporter, because it means the U.S. will be consuming more oil than we would otherwise," he said. "The EIA projections assume the planned increases in fuel economy go into effect, so the EIA projection of when we become a net exporter of energy would be pushed further out if we weaken fuel economy standards." Our ruling Trump said that "we have become an energy exporter for the first time ever just recently." This statement is problematic regardless of how you interpret his statement -- gross energy exports, net energy exports, gross crude-oil exports, and net natural gas exports. The closest he would come to being accurate is if he were referring to net natural gas exports, but even there, it hasn’t happened yet, contrary to what his past-tense statement indicates.

pomt-06482	Says he’s "never asked for more" than inflationary budget increases in his 10 budgets as Milwaukee County sheriff	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/oct/16/david-clarke-jr/clarke-says-hes-never-asked-more-inflationary-incr/	David A. Clarke Jr. wants you to know that Chris Abele is not the new sheriff in town. Clarke, the Milwaukee County sheriff since 2002, was spitting bullets when Abele -- the successor to former Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker -- proposed balancing the 2012 county budget in large part by cutting deeply into Clarke’s agency. Abele is a "novice" with "disdain for law and order" and a desire to "coddle criminals," Clarke said on the Sept. 30, 2011 "Midday with Charlie Sykes" show on WTMJ-AM (620). Abele, the sheriff went on, proposes "gutting" the Sheriff’s Department. The sheriff said he was very careful with taxpayer dollars, dating back to the Walker era, then added something that caught our ear. "I never asked for additional resources. I never asked for more," Clarke said. "Every budget I’ve ever asked for is just a cost to continue. In other words, what we’re doing now, I’m satisfied with the money that you gave us last year. If you just give us that again, with the rate of inflation because salaries go up and all those kind of things, I said, ‘I’m fine.’ He continued: "And even with that, the (County Board) would turn around and take some money away. But you know, I can live with that. I don’t run the budget and I realize the finances are not infinite. The county’s in bad shape, I understand that." We’re aware of Clarke’s past efforts to streamline the department and rein in overtime payments that before his arrival had routinely helped bust the budget. But did Clarke really confine himself -- every year -- to asking for inflationary increases? Let’s frame this dispute -- and then take a look at the numbers. Abele praises the Sheriff’s Department’s role but says that "by statute and by practice, the sheriff plays only a limited role as a traditional law enforcement agency." That’s the reason for the cuts, Abele told the County Board on Sept. 29, 2011. Clarke is outspoken in his criticism of liberal elected officials, and sees Abele as just that. Plus, Abele’s misinformed about public safety, Clarke says. In particular, Clarke took shots at Abele’s bold decision to try to direct Clarke to make specific cuts. That usurps the sheriff’s constitutional powers, Clarke argues. Now the numbers. Part of this is simple math. County records document what Clarke asked for each year compared with the adopted budget handed to him the year before. We looked at 10 budgets, from Clarke’s first in 2003 to the proposal he made for 2012. We found that in five years, his requests topped the previous year -- while in five years he asked for less or about the same. When he sought more, the increases ranged from 4 percent up to 13 percent. In every case through 2010, those increases were greater than inflation, based on the consumer price index for Milwaukee-Racine calculated by the U.S. Department of Labor. The government has not yet calculated 2011 rates. Seems cut and dried. But nothing involving Milwaukee County’s often-arcane and cumbersome budgeting process is simple, so we took a second look and talked to the sheriff and other county officials. First, Clarke. Through his budget officials, Clarke didn’t dispute that the county records, on their face, will show larger-than-inflation increases. But he said he is using a different standard: budget increases minus the costs for employee benefits. The different standard, of course, provides a different picture. Unless you’ve been been stuck in the deep tunnel for the past decade, you probably have some notion that skyrocketing pension costs after the notorious 2002 pension deal -- plus hyper-generous health insurance for county workers -- have driven up county costs and taxes dramatically. "As the County has downsized, the ‘legacy’ fringe benefits (obligations for those not still working here) have been spread across fewer employees. The health care and pension cost increases have been everybody's problem," said Stephen Cady, the County Board’s fiscal and budget analyst. "Each year, departments have had to cut to absorb the growing fringe costs that get allocated to their department." Those fringe benefit costs are from active employees, too, not just retirees. Clarke says that if you remove those fringe costs, his budget requests collectively have come in under the inflation rate. He’s right -- at least when you compare inflation through 2010 (latest year available) to Clarke’s first eight budgets. But the inflation comparison works against him if you include 2011, when his request went up 13.4 percent. In that year, we should note, an accounting change involving Clarke’s bailiffs explained a big chunk of the increase. It’s not surprising that Clarke’s budgets look better by his definition: He’s removed one of the leading -- if not the leading -- inflationary driver in the county budget from his calculations. That issue affects all departments. "This is the cost of doing business," said Abele spokesman Jeff Bentoff. "Every department is responsible for the fringe costs associated with their employees." Indeed, other departments did not get the benefit of property tax-levy increases the Sheriff’s Department has seen. Abele says the department’s levy has gone up 62 percent in the decade, while Clarke says 37 percent is a fairer number. Either way it’s a big bump compared, for example, with the zero percent increase for the Parks Department, or the drop in levy for transit. Clarke has trimmed about one in five positions from his agency, thereby eliminating some employee fringe benefit costs. But that underscores he does have some control over those costs. In any case, Clarke’s leave-out-the-benefits approach is not the conventional way the budget is viewed. Nor did he note that limitation when he made the ear-catching statement. What’s more, if we looked at every department that way, tens of millions of dollars in county tax dollars would magically disappear from the books -- but not from that tax bill in your mailbox. Our conclusion Clarke says he "never asked for more" than inflationary budget increases in his 10 budgets as Milwaukee County sheriff. It’s true if you overlook the massive fringe benefit increases that have pushed up county costs, frustrating Clarke and every other department head who cut back only to see costs rise. But the bottom line is, Clarke’s redefinition of his budget requests is unofficial and not recorded in county records. We rate his statement False.	None	David A.

pomt-09310	"We had a press conference here that interestingly no one in the mainstream media covered."	false	/texas/statements/2010/apr/19/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-says-mainstream-media-didnt-cover-a/	Texas Gov. Rick Perry, hailed by many conservatives who see Democrats in Washington as trampling on states' rights, told an interviewer for the Texas Tribune and Newsweek magazine last week that his public endorsement of a 2009 Texas House resolution on state sovereignty was not covered by mainstream news organizations. Perry said: “We had a press conference here that interestingly no one in the mainstream media covered." We wondered if Perry accurately recapped the April 9, 2009, news conference at which he endorsed a concurrent resolution authored by state Rep. Brandon Creighton stating the Legislature claims "sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States over all powers not otherwise enumerated and granted to the federal government by the Constitution of the United States." Perry’s office didn’t respond to our request for elaboration on the media presence at the press conference. Next, we found indications the news conference was covered by at least two media outlets -- the Austin American-Statesman and the Associated Press. Currently, more than 100 Texas newspapers and more than 150 Texas broadcast outlets are AP members and get its dispatches, according to Dale Leach, AP's Dallas bureau chief. Leach said the AP distributed five photos taken by a staff photographer who attended the press conference. The 246-word AP report on the press conference, sent out at 5:53 p.m. that day, quotes Perry saying: “I believe that our federal government has become oppressive. I believe it's become oppressive in its size, its intrusion into the lives of our citizens and its interference with the affairs of our state.” The article also states: “Answering a question from a news reporter, Perry suggested that (U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey) Hutchison,” then poised to challenge Perry in the 2010 GOP primary for governor, “is part of the federal government's expansion.” Our hunch: The mentioned reporter was Ken Herman, then a staff writer in the Austin American-Statesman’s Capitol bureau. Herman posted a blog and video from Perry’s press conference at 3:10 p.m. the same day; both remain online. According to the video, Perry took questions from Herman, who asked if Perry included Hutchison among active participants in expanding federal powers. Perry said she'd be among individuals in that category. Herman also asked if Perry could specify ways Hutchison had supported expansions in federal powers. “I’ll get you the long and distinguished list of those shortly,” Perry said. We found one Statesman news article that could explain why Perry says no one from the mainstream media covered the press conference. The article by Jason Embry of the Statesman’s Capitol staff -- published a week after the event -- states that Perry's remarks gave him a bounce in national attention even though the resolution itself “barely drew a mention in the print editions of the state’s daily newspapers” the day after the press conference. So, how does Perry’s recap stand up? The AP and the Statesman are clearly part of the mainstream media. We rate Perry's statement as False.

pomt-13374	Say photographs of Hillary Clinton at the debate show what could be an earpiece.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/28/blog-posting/claims-hillary-clinton-wore-earpiece-debate-dont-h/	The Internet had lots of questions about the first presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Here’s one of them: Was Clinton wearing an earpiece? "Has Hillary Been Caught Cheating (Again)?" asked Charisma News, a Christian political website. "Was Hillary Wired for Trump Debate?" asked the conservative website World Net Daily. The U.K.-based Express website summarized, "Did Hillary Clinton wear an earpiece to CHEAT the US debate? Conspiracy theory sweeps web." It’s not the first time Clinton has faced such suggestions. As Snopes.com has noted, some questioned whether Clinton had been wearing one at NBC’s commander-in-chief forum on Sept. 7. Snopes concluded that there was "nothing unusual" and what viewers were seeing "most likely captured a light source temporarily reflecting on Clinton's ear." A reader suggested we check out what happened at the first debate -- an even higher-profile event with upward of 80 million Americans watching. So we will. (Snopes gave a False rating to a related claim that Clinton had a bulge in the back of her jacket at the debate that could have been a "coughing prevention machine.") The original post, at Charisma News, said the device "was meant to match her skin tone almost perfectly." The article speculated that the device could be a hearing aid, an "inductive earpiece" used by actors to better hear cues, or an "anti-seizure device." "None of these paint a particularly good picture for the Democratic presidential nominee. Either she has an as-yet undisclosed health condition, ranging from mild to severe, or she's been cheating during the televised debates," the article says. For the record, Clinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin told PolitiFact that Clinton "was not wearing an earpiece." Asked whether she has a hearing aid, he said, "No." So, let’s take a look at the original evidence offered -- a Reuters photo and an enlargement that some say show the suspicious, fleshy bulge in Clinton’s ear. To be honest, we don’t see any device in this image. (What’s more flesh-like than flesh itself?) But we decided to look at some other images in our wire service archive to see if anything else made her ear look unusual. When we reached out to Charisma News, an editor suggested that we contact the author of the article. We emailed him the images, but we did not hear back. Image 1 (Damon Winter/New York Times) Close-up Image 2 (Doug Mills/New York Times) Close-up Image 3 (Associated Press/David Goldman) Close-up Image 4 (Associated Press/David Goldman) Close-up In these four close-ups, we see nothing that mirrors what the original Reuters image showed (which, again, didn’t even look like a device to us). We just see a lot of ear flesh. When we ran these images by Richard Quindry, a Philadelphia-area photographic and Photoshop expert, he said that only image 2 could even potentially show anything -- the narrow white form inside the ear canal. But even saying that that shape is something other than skin would be speculative at best, he said. Each of the other images -- as well as the original Reuters image -- show "nothing" to support a claim that she used an earpiece, Quindry said. Our ruling Internet claims suggested that a debate photograph of Clinton showed her wearing an earpiece. Neither the original photograph presented as evidence nor other enlargements of photographs taken at the debate show anything that looks like an earpiece or a hearing aid. Pants on Fire!

pomt-14782	"There are over 700,000 Americans on some watch list or another that would all be captured" in a Democratic amendment intended to stop suspected terrorists from buying guns.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/06/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-700000-americans-could-be-affecte/	Democrats’ proposed legislation to stop terrorists from buying guns would unintentionally harm the Second Amendment rights of everyday Americans, said presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. Rubio and other Senate Republicans voted down legislation that allowed the attorney general to ban "known or suspected dangerous terrorists" from obtaining firearms or explosives. Under current law, thousands of people on the FBI’s terrorist watch list have been able to purchase such weapons legally. But the terrorist watch list sometimes includes people who aren’t actually terrorists, Rubio said on CNN’s State of the Union Dec. 6, and it would be wrong to deny those people their right to own a gun. "If these were perfect lists, that would be one thing," he said. "But there are over 700,000 Americans on some watch list or another that would all be captured under this amendment the Democrats offered. And that's the problem." We wondered if there were really 700,000 Americans who could potentially get caught up on a terrorist watch list and be prevented from buying guns under Democratic legislation. Rubio’s count is way off. The number of Americans on the consolidated terrorist watch list is likely in the thousands, not hundreds of thousands. We reached out to Rubio’s team, but they didn’t get back to us. By the numbers The FBI’s Terrorist Screening Center maintains what is colloquially known as the terrorist watch list. The Terrorist Screening Database is a consolidated collection of information about people known or reasonably suspected to have some level of involvement in terrorist activities. The no-fly list is a subset of the terrorist watch list. The terrorist watch list is the one the attorney general would pull from when deciding whether someone should be denied a firearm if there’s reasonable belief that the person would use that firearm for terrorism, under the Democrats’ bill, said Ashley Schapitl, spokeswoman for bill sponsor Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. The terrorist watch list pulls information from numerous government agencies in the United States and around the world, so American citizens and legal residents only make up a portion of the list. A pretty small portion, in fact. A Terrorist Screening Center spokesman declined to comment on the watch list’s current size, but we found an estimate on a 2011 FBI fact-sheet that put it at 420,000 individuals. Of those, only about 8,400 were American citizens or legal residents. The no-fly list subset included about 16,000 names, only 500 of whom were Americans. Current estimates of the number of people on the list -- foreign and American combined -- now hover around 700,000, the number Rubio cited. But there’s no way that the number of Americans on the list has grown to 700,000, said Timothy Edgar, who oversaw civil liberties and national intelligence issues, including the terrorist watch list, under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. "Rubio is almost certainly off by orders of magnitude," said Edgar, now a visiting fellow at Brown University. The number of Americans on the list likely doesn’t exceed 10,000, said Martin Reardon, former chief of the FBI Terrorist Screening Center’s operations branch. Some innocent people have been wrongly included in the terrorist watch list or the no-fly list, which can affect their lives in ways such as having to go through extra airport security or being stopped from boarding a plane. But for an American to get on that list by accident is "harder than people think," added Reardon, who is now a vice president at the Soufan Group, a consulting firm. It’s more likely that a person would have the same name as someone who is on the list, and that person could run into problems at the airport if a security agent makes a misidentification, Reardon said. This happened to the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., who once wasn’t allowed to fly because he had a similar name to the alias of a suspected terrorist on the no-fly list. But the problem of same names is less common than it used to be, and there is a reasonably efficient redress process for people to appeal to the government to get their name removed from the terrorist watch list, Edgar noted. "That shows that the redress process is not a sham, but it also shows that a fairly significant number of people are put on the watchlist by mistake," he said. Still, it’s nowhere close to 700,000 Americans. Our ruling Rubio said, "There are over 700,000 Americans on some watch list or another that would all be captured" in a Democratic amendment intended to stop suspected terrorists from buying guns. Under the Democrats’ proposal, the attorney general would have some discretion in denying firearms to people on the FBI’s consolidated terrorist watchlist. While it’s reasonable to estimate that there are 700,000 people on this list, only a small fraction are American citizens or legal residents. Experts said it’s likely that only about 10,000 are Americans, while the rest are foreigners. We rate Rubio’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-00021	Says "Kurt Russell supports Trump" by wearing a Trump T-shirt.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/nov/06/blog-posting/photo-kurt-russell-trump-t-shirt-doctored/	An old photo of actors Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn is resurfacing claiming that Russell "supports Trump." The photo, posted on May 9, 2016, to the Facebook page "Florida Firefighters for TRUMP," shows Russell and Hawn walking down the sidewalk, holding hands and wearing shirts with American flags and "Trump 2016." Russell’s shirt shows a photo of Trump holding a gun and references the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, more commonly known as ISIS. "We’re Gonna Knock the Hell Outta ISIS," the shirt reads. The caption with the photo also names "Stephen (The Bull) McCaffrey," a reference to the 1991 film "Backdraft" in which Russell plays a Chicago firefighter. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Facebook page that posted the photo did not immediately respond to a message asking for evidence for its claim. An image search shows the photo is doctored. The photo was taken of the couple years ago while Hawn and Russell were out in Los Angeles, according to a September 2015 PopSugar article. They can be seen walking together, holding hands and wearing the same outfits the altered photo shows them in — only without American flags or references to Trump or ISIS on their white shirts. It’s not the first time Russell has been tied to Trump in viral social media posts. An image recently circulated on Facebook with a quote from Russell praising Trump. We rated that Pants on Fire. Our ruling An altered photo attempts to depict Russell and Hawn as Trump supporters, by adding "Trump 2016," American flags and more to their shirts.

pomt-12684	Blue Cross Blue Shield ended "2016 open enrollment with 1 million members in the Florida marketplace."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2017/mar/15/kathleen-sebelius/florida-blue-ended-2016-1-million-members-obamacar/	Democrats have ripped apart the GOP plan to replace the Affordable Care Act, arguing that it will take away insurance from millions of Americans. Kathleen Sebelius defended President Barack Obama’s health care law, which she helped implement, in a March 12 interview on Meet the Press. The former head of Health and Human Services pointed to the experience of one of the main insurers in Florida, Blue Cross Blue Shield, which is headed by CEO Pat Geraghty, as a success story. "Florida has not been a welcoming state to this law. Pat Geraghty ended up 2016 open enrollment with 1 million members in the Florida marketplace and as a company in the black. He said, ‘Of course this works. We can make it work. We can go forward.’ " We decided to fact-check Sebelius’ claim about the number of Floridians who enrolled through the federal health care law in spite of Republican efforts against it, including from Gov. Rick Scott, who campaigned on a promise to repeal it. Florida Blue enrollment Blue Cross Blue Shield operates under the name Florida Blue in the Sunshine State. The insurer’s enrollment rose in recent years through the Affordable Care Act, said Paul Kluding, a company spokesman. At the end of the open enrollment season on Jan. 31, 2017, Florida Blue had 940,000 ACA members -- an increase from 715,000 in 2016. Florida Blue anticipated an increase because some other insurers, such as UnitedHealthCare and Aetna, exited the marketplace where consumers can shop for policies. "The number fluctuates throughout the year, but historically the enrollment numbers actually increase within the few months following the open enrollment close date, so that number will probably rise slightly over the next couple of months," Kluding said. Florida Blue sells plans in all Florida counties and is the largest insurer participating in the federal marketplace in Florida. With all insurers combined, about 1.7 million Floridians enrolled through the federal health care law for 2017. So Florida Blue is the largest insurer on the marketplace. Sebelius and Geraghty both attended an annual health care conference at the University of Miami on March 3. At the conference, Kluding said, Geraghty told Sebelius "that the company is now serving approximately 1 million individual members, and that Florida Blue has operated this ACA business profitably." Florida Blue made a small profit in the ACA market -- a single-digit positive margin, Kluding said. Sebelius’ number about Florida Blue enrollment was close to the actual figure. But she is cherry-picking an example of an insurer that had success in a particular state. Michael Tanner, a health policy expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, said that there are vast differences in how insurers fared in various states. While Florida Blue may have done well, it’s counterpart in North Carolina "did terribly," he said. In North Carolina, Blue Cross lost $405 million on medical expenses for ACA customers in 2014 and 2015 but stayed in the marketplace for 2017. The majority of Blue Cross insurers in the states are non-profits, making comparisons to other providers difficult. "It's a little bit apples and oranges to compare Blues to other insurers -- they have a special non- profit status, and they are not taxed the same way. They have the largest market shares and historically being the insurer of last resort, their pool didn’t change as radically as a lot of other insurance companies did," Tanner said. While Florida Blue has seen rising enrollment, some other insurers have scaled back offering plans on the exchange in Florida or have exited the market entirely. (Half of the insurers doing business in Florida offer plans on the exchange.) UnitedHealthCare and Aetna exited the individual market, although Aetna is still writing off-exchange plans, said Amy Bogner, a spokeswoman for the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation. Humana withdrew from 31 of the 38 counties in the individual market in Florida and canceled all off-exchange business. In August, Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini blamed a pre-tax loss of more than $430 million since January 2014 for the decision. Our ruling Sebelius said Blue Cross Blue Shield ended "2016 open enrollment with 1 million members in the Florida marketplace." Her number is close. Florida Blue said 940,000 people enrolled as of Jan. 31, and the insurer expects the number to rise. It's also important to note that some other insurers have scaled back or dropped out of offering plans on the exchange. We rate this statement Mostly True.

pomt-04818	Says she does the jobs of state auditor, secretary of state and lieutenant governor "for less than the price of one of them" in Washington state.	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2012/aug/17/kate-brown/oregons-secretary-state-three-one-deal/	Oregon’s Secretary of State Kate Brown likes to talk about saving money. The last time we checked out something she said, she was touting the savings her audit division had dug up. More recently, she talked about what a steal Oregon’s secretary of state position is, noting that it’s basically three jobs in one. "Our neighbor to the north, the state of Washington, they elect a lieutenant governor, a secretary of state and a state auditor," Brown said in a May television interview. "I basically do all three of those jobs for less than the price of one of them." This wasn’t the first time we’d heard Brown say something along these lines, so we thought it was worth checking out. To be sure, Brown’s position as secretary of state is unique. She’s the only secretary of state in the nation who oversees an audit division -- we got that verified by Leslie Reynolds, the executive director of the National Association of Secretaries of State. (Her source was the 2010 Book of the States, which we also double checked.) Oregon is also one of five states that don’t have a lieutenant governor -- and one of three in which the secretary of state is next in line in case of a vacancy. We also did a quick salary check to see if Brown has her numbers right, and it seems she does, according to public documents from both states. Excluding benefits and such, Brown makes $72,000 a year as Oregon’s secretary of state. Meanwhile, Washington pays its state auditor $116,950 a year, its lieutenant governor $110,831 and its secretary of state $119,222. Now that all seemed fair, but we wondered whether Brown really picks up all the slack for those two missing positions. That’s a little less clear. Let’s start with the lieutenant governor position. We called up Brian Dirks, the spokesman for Washington’s Lt. Gov. Brad Owen. Dirks said the office only has two constitutional duties: Filling in for the governor in her absence and serving as president of the state senate. In Oregon, Brown is responsible for the first, but not the second. Sen. Peter Courtney is the president of Oregon’s Senate -- he has been for nearly a decade. Dirks also noted that Owen sits on 15 to 20 different committees, including the state finance committee, and focuses on both international relations and economic development. Those sorts of things are not part of Brown’s job. Next up was the state auditor. We made a call to Mindy Chambers, the spokeswoman for Washington State Auditor Brian Sonntag, who explained that the state auditor doesn’t actually do much auditing himself. Instead, he "sets the overall tone for the office." He also assigns special projects, speaks publicly on behalf of the auditing office and works on open-government issues. In Oregon, Brown does oversee the audit division and she’s responsible for selecting its director -- currently Gary Blackmer -- but beyond that she doesn’t have much of a role. Blackmer seems to us to be the better foil for Washington’s Sonntag. Like Sonntag, he doesn’t actually perform audits, but he does put together a list of proposed audits. Blackmer also keeps track of what’s happening with the given audits moving through the division. His day is filled with meetings, budget discussions, editing duties and several other responsibilities. He also pulls in double what Brown makes a year -- and more than any of the Washington officials. To be fair, Blackmer runs his list of proposed audits by Brown for her approval. She also says she selected him specifically because he "understood my vision for the office." Specifically, Oregon had a strong fiscal auditing history before Brown was elected, so she made it a point to have Blackmer beef up the performance audit side. So, when Brown said she’s a threefer, essentially doing in one role what Washington elects three people to do, she’s technically correct. She selects the chief auditor, she is typically seen as the de facto lieutenant governor and, of course, she is Oregon’s secretary of state. But once you drill down to specific duties, that statement is less accurate. You’ll find that she doesn’t exactly do in Oregon what the lieutenant governor does in Washington, other than potentially filling in for the governor. You’ll also note that the state audit director has a much more hands-on supervisory role than does Brown. In terms of the finances, the savings are also dubious. If you don’t count what our Senate president makes -- less than $40,000 a year -- Brown and Blackmer come at a cost of $216,000 to the state. Washington pays out $345,000 for its three officials. That’s not exactly a one-for-three deal. Brown says she uses the threefer pitch mostly as a way to indicate that Oregon has a lean state government. "I think it's fair to say the three for one is not an apples to apples comparison," she said. "I think it's particularly compelling in that it sort of lets Oregonians know what a lean sort of operating machine Oregon state government is when you compare us to other states." We think her general gist is accurate, Oregon gets by with fewer elected officials. But the statement that she does three jobs for the price of one ignores some critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-13251	Says Hillary Clinton was "let off the hook" for her email scandal while Gen. David Petraeus had his life "destroyed for doing far, far less."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/18/donald-trump/fbi-director-james-comey-says-donald-trump-has-it-/	Donald Trump has declared repeatedly that Hillary Clinton should be imprisoned over her email. Emails on her unsecured personal email server were found to have contained classified information despite her repeated insistence that all the material was unclassified. His evidence: other public officials, including David Petraeus, a former CIA director and a leading general in Iraq and Afghanistan, have been punished for far less. During a West Palm Beach, Fla., rally Oct. 13, Trump mentioned FBI Director James Comey, who decided that Clinton's actions did not rise to the level of prosecution. Trump said that Comey "let her off the hook while other lives, including General Petraeus and many others, have been destroyed for doing far, far less. This is a conspiracy against you the American people and we cannot let this happen or continue." Trump has made similar comments before, which we’ve looked at in another report. But this time there is more information publicly available about the information practices of both Petreaus and Clinton. ​So we decided to compare the two cases for the Truth-O-Meter. We're relying on Comey's statements because they were made under oath before two congressional committees, and he is one of the few people familiar with the circumstances and the secrets involved in both cases who is able to speak on the record. Comey’s initial testimony Petraeus pled guilty in 2015 to a misdemeanor charge of mishandling confidential materials. He was fined $100,000 and given two years probation. He had given his mistress, Paula Broadwell, access to eight notebooks with top-secret and code information. She had made copies of over 300 documents marked "secret." In addition, Petraeus lied to FBI agents investigating the case. In Clinton's case, the FBI found 110 emails with classified information on her server, eight of which were designated top secret. Comey, in a July 5 news conference, said there was no evidence of Clinton or her staff intending to violate the law. But he also said Clinton should have known that her handling of the emails was inappropriate, and that her behavior was "extremely reckless" because outsiders could hack her server. The FBI director was asked about the Clinton-Petraeus comparison during his July 7 appearance before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. "Do you agree with the claim that General Petraeus, and I quote, 'Got in trouble for far less,' end of quote? Do you agree with that statement?" asked Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-MD. "No, it's the reverse," the FBI director said. Comey cited the Petraeus case as one that "illustrates perfectly the kind of cases the Department of Justice is willing to prosecute. Even there, they prosecuted him for a misdemeanor. "In that case, you had vast quantities of highly classified information, including special sensitive compartmented information. That's the reference to code words. (A) vast quantity of it, not only shared with someone without authority to have it, but we found it in a search warrant hidden under the insulation in his attic, and then he lied to us about it during the investigation," Comey said. (Later in the hearing, Comey said his staff had corrected him and the notebooks were found in Petraeus' desk, not his attic.) "So you have obstruction of justice, you have intentional misconduct and a vast quantity of information," Comey said. "He admitted he knew that was the wrong thing to do. That is a perfect illustration of the kind of cases that get prosecuted. In my mind, it illustrates importantly the distinction to this (Clinton) case." "And General Petraeus did not admit to these facts when the FBI investigators first interviewed him, did he?" Cummings asked. "No," Comey said, "he lied about it." Comey's subsequent testimony Eighty three days later, Comey was called before the House Judiciary Committee where Republicans tried to get him to change his mind about prosecuting Clinton, and Blake Farenthold, R-Tex., brought up the matter again. Farenthold: "How do you respond to people who are saying that this is not how (the) average American would be treated. This is only how Hillary Clinton would be treated?" Comey: "When people tell you that others have been treated differently, demand from a trustworthy source the details of those cases because — I'm a very aggressive investigator, I was a very aggressive prosecutor — I have gone back through 40 years of cases, and I'm telling you under oath that to prosecute on these facts would be a double standard, because Jane and Joe Smith would not be prosecuted on these facts." Comey said that, at the FBI, if an agent uses an unclassified email system to do business and, while on that system, talks about classified topics "you will be in big trouble with the FBI. I'm highly confident of that. I'm also confident, in fact certain, you would not be prosecuted. That's what folks tend to lump together. So I care deeply about what people think about the justice system and that it not have two standards. It does not, and this demonstrates it." Steven Aftergood, senior research analyst at the Federation of American Scientists and an expert on national security secrecy, said, "FBI Director Comey's conclusions have unique weight because he was in a position to investigate and assess both cases in depth. The rest of us (including Trump) have to rely on what has been publicly reported or speculated upon. To me, Comey's conclusion is the end of the matter." Finally, it's worth noting that during the Oct. 4, 2016, vice presidential debate, a variant of the theme came up as Republican Mike Pence said, "If your son or my son handled classified information the way Hillary Clinton did . . . they'd be court-martialed." Democrat Tim Kaine said, "That is absolutely false, and you know that." The Washington Post Fact Checker, after noting that Clinton's Cabinet-level position made this an apples-to-oranges comparison, consulted about a dozen retired military lawyers and found there was no absolute answer at all. "What we found was that it’s absolutely unclear, and is subject to prosecutorial discretion and the circumstances of each case," the Post reported. "Technically, yes, a service member can be court-martialed for behavior like Clinton’s, but it’s more likely the person would face administrative action. And the administrative action would depend on each service member’s disciplinary history, the evidence available and prosecutorial discretion." We contacted several people at the Trump campaign noting Comey's testimony and asked for Trump's evidence. We didn't hear back. Our ruling Trump said Clinton was "let off the hook" for her email scandal "while other lives, including General Petraeus and many others, have been destroyed for doing far, far less." The director of the FBI director, the man who has intimate knowledge of both cases, has repeatedly insisted under oath that the reverse is true. Petraeus’ case was worse because he intentionally passed a large amount of classified information to an unauthorized person and then lied about it to the FBI. We rate Trump's statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e7a8b46e-fe2d-4fa1-b976-cedce2031a88	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-10-18T10:47:19	2016-10-13	['David_Petraeus']
pomt-13523	The number of illegal immigrants "could be 3 million. It could be 30 million."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/01/donald-trump/donald-trump-repeats-pants-fire-claim-about-30-mil/	In a major policy speech on immigration, Donald Trump criticized the government’s approach to the undocumented population, sayings the feds don’t even know the scope of the problem. "Honestly we've been hearing that number for years. It's always 11 million. Our government has no idea. It could be 3 million. It could be 30 million," Trump said. "They have no idea what the number is. Frankly our government has no idea what they're doing on many, many fronts, folks." Trump questioned the 11 million figure early in his presidential bid last year, and floated 30 million and 34 million as alternative estimates. That claim rates Pants on Fire. Is it possible that, a year later, Trump’s claim of 3 million or 30 million is more accurate? The answer is still no. Estimating the undocumented The U.S. Homeland Security Department last estimated the size of the undocumented immigrant population at 11.4 million in January 2012, down from a peak of 12.2 million in 2007. This count includes people who entered the United States illegally and people who overstayed their visas. Figures from independent organizations that study immigration are all in the same ballpark. Here’s a rundown: Unauthorized population size (2012) Unauthorized population size (latest year) Dept. of Homeland Security 11.4 million Pew Research Center 11.2 million 11.3 million (2014) Center for Migration Studies 11.1 million 10.9 million (2014) Center for Immigration Studies 11 to 12 million 11.7 million (2016)* *This is a preliminary estimate. All of these figures come from subtracting known legal immigrants from the total number of foreign-born people documented in the U.S. census and then controlling for the estimated percentage of unauthorized immigrants who refuse to answer the census. Researchers at all of the organizations told us Trump’s statement is wildly inaccurate. There is "absolutely zero possibility" for the number to be just 3 million or as many as 30 million," according to Robert Warren of the Center for Migration Studies, a nonpartisan immigration policy think tank. "There is strong evidence that the number is 11 million, with a plausible margin of error of plus or minus 1 million," he said. Jeffrey Passel, a demographer at the Pew Research Center, called both of Trump’s numbers "virtually impossible" and explained why. On the low end, survey data shows large enough foreign-born populations and legal admissions that there could not be as few as 3 million people. The high-end of Trump’s offered estimate is contradicted by the limited number of housing units in the United States, Mexico and Central America’s census data and surveys’ size, and U.S. data on admissions and departures. "There’s simply no way for an additional 20 million people to be in the country and have escaped detection," Passel said. If the figure really is as high as 30 million, school enrollment and birth registration would reflect that, as both public schooling and birthright citizenship are incentives for undocumented immigrants, pointed out Steven Camarota, research director at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for low levels of legal immigrants. "But the numbers are not out of whack," Camarota said. "Bottom line is we don’t know what the number is for sure. But based on the available evidence, it seems very unlikely that it’s 20 million (more)." Why it’s ‘always’ 11 million Trump suggested he was skeptical of the 11 million figure because it’s "always" been the estimate. Experts told us there’s a good explanation for that: a steady flow of people coming in and leaving. "The reason that he has heard the same number for years is that the population has not been growing," said Warren. "There’s enormous churn in the illegal immigration population. Hundreds of thousands come in at 11 million and then hundreds of thousands leave," Camarota said, adding that the undocumented population is a demographically unusual group as it can’t grow by births (as all children born in the United States are citizens). But even if you folded in these citizen children, the number would be 17 million at most, he said. While the federal estimate hasn’t been updated in a few years, experts agreed that the outside groups’ calculations are sound. Still, Camarota criticized the government for not providing a more recent figure. "This creates enormous uncertainty in a debate about an important policy issue. It’s like saying, ‘We should do something about the deficit, but we don’t know how big it is,’ " he said. "We talk about something that everyone perceives is a problem without any data." Our ruling Trump said the number of illegal immigrants "could be 3 million. It could be 30 million." Both figures are not within the range of possibility. Every credible estimate we found was in the 11 million range, with a margin of error of around 1 million. The figure has "always" been 11 million, in recent years, because of the flow of undocumented immigrants in and out of the United States.

pomt-10096	McCain is "selectively editing Joe Biden's words...Biden actually said about Barack Obama: 'They're gonna find out this guy's got steel in his spine.'"	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/28/barack-obama/campaigns-volley-over-bidens-warning/	Sen. Barack Obama plays defense in a new television ad , alleging that in a previous ad Sen. John McCain's campaign "selectively edits" the words of Obama's running mate, Sen. Joe Biden. The only problem is the Obama ad – which the campaign released Oct. 27, 2008, in the Northern Virginia market – at a minimum employs, um, selective editing. Let's unravel this tangled web of selectivity to see who's being dishonest, beginning with the McCain ad that started the volley. "Listen to Joe Biden talking about what electing Barack Obama will mean," the narrator says. Then we hear an audio recording of Biden at a recent fundraiser: "Mark my words: It will not be six months before the world tests Barack Obama," we hear Biden say, as sinister music plays over images of hooded gunmen, and hostile foreign leaders. "The world is looking. We're going to have an international crisis to test the mettle of this guy. I guarantee you it's gonna happen." "It doesn't have to happen," the narrator continues. "Vote McCain." Those comments by Biden are lifted from a talk he gave to campaign contributors at Seattle's Sheraton Hotel on Oct. 19, 2008. Are they a fair representation of Biden's point of view? To find out we have to look at Biden's remarks in more context – a good deal of context, in fact. "Barack is the right guy at the right moment for this job," he said. He riffed on foreign affairs a bit, then continued: "Barack gets it...And I'll tell you why I'm telling you this: because we're going to find ourselves in real trouble when we get elected...We're gonna have the largest systemic deficit in modern – not modern – in the history of the world...So there are going to be a lot of tough decisions Barack's gonna have to make, a lot of very tough decisions, including on foreign policy. And here's the point I want to make: mark my words. Mark my words. It will not be six months before the world tests Barack Obama like they did John Kennedy. The world is looking. We're about to elect a brilliant 47-year-old president of the United States of America. Remember I said it standing here if you don't remember anything else I said. Watch, we're gonna have an international crisis, a generated crisis, to test the mettle of this guy...we're gonna need you to use your influence, your influence in the community, to stand with him. Because it's not gonna be apparent initially, it's not gonna be apparent that we're right. Because all these decisions, all these decisions, once they're made if they work, then they weren't viewed as a crisis. If they don't work, it's viewed as you didn't make the right decision, a little bit like how we hesitated so long dealing with Bosnia and with Kosovo, and as a consequence 200,000 people lost their lives that maybe didn't have to lose lives. It's how we made a mistake in Iraq. We made a mistake in Somalia. So there's gonna be some tough decisions." Did McCain's ad distort Biden's point? It omitted Biden's implication that Obama is up to whatever challenges he'll face. But by raising the interventions in Bosnia, Iraq and Somalia – decisions by Republican and Democratic presidents that Biden framed as flawed – he also left room for the possibility that Obama will make mistakes in grappling with international challenges. So the McCain campaign omitted crucial context, but didn't exactly turn Biden's meaning on its head either. Now let's look more closely at Obama's response ad. "An economic meltdown, two wars," it says. "And John McCain's playing with audio tapes, selectively editing Joe Biden's words." So far, that's more or less accurate, as we've seen. It goes on to say: "The next president will be tested. But here's what Biden actually said about Barack Obama: 'They're gonna find out this guy's got steel in his spine.'" Well yes, Biden did say that. But not at the appearance the McCain campaign highlighted in its ad. The "steel in his spine clip," a phrase Biden has used frequently, came from an appearance a day earlier at a fundraiser in San Francisco . So the Obama campaign took Biden's words out of context even as they accused the McCain campaign of that very sin. But was that a distortion? Not really. It was more of a misdemeanor. At the Seattle fundraiser Biden did indeed praise Obama emphatically, just perhaps not as concisely as he had in San Francisco. (We should note that several news organizations erroneously reported that Biden made the "steel in his spine" comment at the Seattle fundraiser, so the Obama campaign's mistake may have been inadvertant.) Did the McCain campaign "selectively edit" Biden? Yes, but editing generally is selective, and this editing didn't really distort Biden's meaning. Did Biden actually say Obama had steel in his spine? Yes, but a day earlier than he made the comments the McCain ad highlighted, not immediately afterward as the Obama ad claimed. The Obama ad suggests there was some outrageous lapse here, but we don't see it. We find the Obama ad Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-10-28T00:00:00	2008-10-27	['Joe_Biden', 'Barack_Obama', 'John_McCain']
pomt-03709	The immigration proposal from the Gang of Eight "is not amnesty."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/apr/17/marco-rubio/sen-marco-rubio-says-immigration-bill-not-amnesty/	Florida Sen. Marco Rubio took on a public relations role ahead of the release of a bill to overhaul immigration. Rubio appeared on seven Sunday talk shows -- a new record, by most accounts -- to promote the legislation and make a pre-emptive strike against conservative resistance. A possible flash point of that resistance: the notion that the bill would provide amnesty for the millions of immigrants living in the United States illegally. "This is not amnesty," Rubio said on Fox News Sunday on April 14, 2013. "Amnesty is the forgiveness of something. Amnesty is anything that says do it illegally, it will be cheaper and easier." We wondered if that’s true. Does the bill give amnesty or not? What’s in the bill Eight senators -- four Republicans, four Democrats -- unveiled the legislation April 17. It addresses lots of issues, including work visas and family reunification. But for this story we’re focused on illegal immigration. A detailed summary of the bill describes some of the hurdles that people here illegally would have to clear before becoming eligible to apply for permanent residency or eventually, citizenship. The bill would allow people to seek "Registered Provisional Immigrant Status," by demonstrating residence in the United States prior to Dec. 31, 2011, having no felony convictions and not more than two misdemeanors and paying a $500 penalty plus back taxes. Another $500 would be required after six years. After 10 years under Registered Provisional Immigrant Status, a person could pay $1,000 and seek a green card using a new merit-based system. People brought here illegally as minors, known as "Dreamers," and workers in an agricultural program would get green cards in five years, versus the 10 for everyone else who qualifies. New security measures would have to be under way before unauthorized immigrants could begin that process, however. The bill calls for $4.5 billion for a strategy that includes new surveillance equipment, fencing along the Mexican border and more customs agents. Employers would be required to check the legal status of employees through an electronic system known as E-Verify. What’s amnesty? One legal dictionary defines amnesty as "a blanket abolition of an offense by the government, with the legal result that those charged or convicted have the charge or conviction wiped out. ... The basis for amnesty is generally because the war or other conditions that made the acts criminal no longer exist or have faded in importance." In modern American politics, though, the usual standard for amnesty is the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. That law, supported by President Ronald Reagan, said that illegal immigrants could become legal permanent residents if they could prove they were in this country by Jan. 1, 1982, and met a few other minimal requirements. The law was widely described as an amnesty program, both then and now. And its failure to stem the flow of illegal immigration is partly why "amnesty" is such a poisonous word today. For a comparison, consider this: the 1986 law granted legal status to any immigrant who had been in the country continuously since 1982, who paid a $185 fine and back taxes and who demonstrated "good moral character." After 18 months, if they learned to speak English, they could become eligible for a green card. So the new bill includes a criminal background check which the 1986 law did not, and it increases the time (to 10 years) and financial requirements (to $2,000) before immigrants could obtain a green card. Arguments pro and con We reached out to immigration experts on all sides for their take on Rubio’s statement. Frank Sharry, director of the pro-citizenship group America’s Voice, said he agrees with Rubio that the bill does not offer amnesty. "If you look at what the consequences are -- first of all you have to come forward and register, submit to a background check. You have to pay fines," he said. "To me it’s kind of like people who are caught for speeding. If you get caught for speeding in many states, they say ‘okay, you have to pay a fine, take a class, lose your license for a while and you’ll be reinstated.’ No one calls that an amnesty." Alex Nowrasteh, with the libertarian Cato Institute, agreed. "This bill includes numerous punishments for unauthorized immigrants who broke the laws, including paying fines and other legal sanctions," he said. "If it was amnesty they would be legalized immediately with no punishment, no process. They would just be forgiven and handed a green card." But Steven Camarota with Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors low levels of immigration, argued that in practice most amnesties -- such as tax or parking ticket amnesties -- involve both a waiver and a penalty. Tax amnesties, for example, often allow delinquent taxpayers to pay back a defined amount, which may include reduced interest or penalties. So they may end up paying less than they would have under prosecution, but not nothing. In this case, Camarota said, "Is the normal rule of law being suspended? The penalty for being in the U.S. illegally normally says you have to go back to your home country. This says you don’t." "I don’t think the fact that it is an amnesty -- which I think it clearly is -- makes it a bad policy," he said. "They’re just not calling it an amnesty because politically that makes it tougher." Our ruling Rubio argues that the legislation outlining a 13-year pathway to legal status and eventually citizenship is not amnesty. He’s right that the bill does not offer blanket legal residency to unauthorized immigrants. The bill mandates fines, background checks and waiting periods, and it’s tougher than its 1986 predecessor. But it also offers a measure of clemency to those immigrants, who would not be required to return to their home countries. We rate Rubio’s statement Half True.

pomt-12244	"It's an absolute fact" that China and North Korea "have consistently over many, many years" meddled in U.S. elections.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/jul/13/reince-priebus/china-and-north-korea-consistently-over-many-many-/	In 1996, Johnny Chung, a Taiwanese-born California businessman, pleaded guilty to illegally funneling money from China to President Bill Clinton and the Democratic National Committee during Clinton’s re-election campaign. Chung later testified before Congress that the donations included $35,000 from the head of China's military intelligence agency to Clinton’s successful reelection effort. The FBI even warned six members of Congress at the time: "We have reason to believe that the government of China may try to make contributions to members of Congress through Asian donors." Perhaps that’s part of what Wisconsinite Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff for President Donald Trump, was alluding to during a July 9, 2017, interview on "Fox News Sunday." Attempting to downplay Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, in which Trump defeated former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Priebus said such interloping has been done for years by other countries, as well. Trump has said, Priebus told host Chris Wallace, that Russia "probably meddled in the election, they did meddle in the election." Priebus continued: "The one thing that he also says -- which drives the media crazy, but it’s an absolute fact -- is that others have as well, and that's true. China has, North Korea has and they have consistently over many, many years." The White House didn’t reply to our emails seeking information to back Priebus’ statement. But experts told us that, aside from the Chung affair, there is no evidence that China -- and certainly not North Korea -- have meddled in American elections. And what U.S. intelligence agencies say the Russians did is far different from the Chung matter. Russia’s meddling Here is how the agencies began their key findings on Russian meddling in a January 2017 report: Russian efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election represent the most recent expression of Moscow’s longstanding desire to undermine the US-led liberal democratic order, but these activities demonstrated a significant escalation in directness, level of activity and scope of effort compared to previous operations. We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election. Russia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump. We have high confidence in these judgments. As has been widely reported, Russian hackers stole emails from the Democratic National Committee and gave them to WikiLeaks. Russian actors gained access to several states’ electoral agencies. Experts believe that Russia was behind a misinformation and propaganda campaign pushing exaggerated or false stories that would spread on social media and get picked up by English-language conspiratorial websites. Most recently, in July 2017, it was reported that Donald Trump Jr. met with a Russian agent who had promised to provide damaging information about Hillary Clinton, and that the president's son knew the allegedly incriminating information was being peddled by the highest levels of the Russian government in order to support the Trump campaign. China and North Korea The dozen experts we contacted said they were aware of no evidence to back Priebus’ claim, or were aware only of the Chung matter. In the Chung case, money was inappropriately or illegally given to a candidate’s campaign account. Priebus’ claim suggests a much broader and government-orchestrated foreign effort, on par with the Russian one. "It’s possible there is some classified intelligence report on China and North Korea and U.S. elections, but I have never heard this claim before, nor seen any evidence," said University of Wisconsin-Madison political science professor Yoshiko Herrera, who is the former director of the school’s Center for Russia, East Europe and Central Asia. "Also, I think for both China and North Korea, they see little difference between U.S. presidential candidates, but rather think of American politicians in general as opposed to China’s or North Korea’s interests, so I don’t know what the motivation for meddling in elections would be." Indeed, Priebus’ claim struck some experts as bizarre. "I have never heard this charge before," said political science professor Robert Ross, an associate at the Center for Chinese Studies at Harvard University. Experts on North Korea were more blunt. "This notion that North Korea meddles in American elections is completely baseless," said Mitchell Lerner, director of the Institute for Korean Studies at Ohio State University. "It’s sort of a stunning assertion," said Leon Sigal, director of the Northeast Asia Cooperative Security Project at the Social Science Research Council in New York. "I just don’t know where it’s coming from. There certainly is no evidence for it." Our rating Speaking to Russia’s meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Priebus said: "It's an absolute fact" that China and North Korea "have consistently over many, many years" meddled in U.S. elections. During President Bill Clinton’s 1996 reelection campaign, money from Chinese citizens, including the head of China’s military agency, was illegally funneled to the reelection effort. But there is no evidence that either China or North Korea -- consistently and over many years -- meddled in U.S. elections. And certainly nothing on the scale of the Russian efforts in the 2016 presidential race, which reached to the highest levels of the Russian government. We rate Priebus’ statement False.

pomt-03455	The Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation is a "proven job creator."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jun/19/john-nygren/rep-john-nygren-says-wisconsin-economic-developmen/	Nearly two years after its creation, the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. -- the quasi-private jobs agency created by Gov. Scott Walker -- has been criticized by Democrats for management turnover, failure to follow up on past due loans and other problems. Those complaints got new life in early May when the nonpartisan Legislative Audit Bureau issued a bruising auditabout WEDC’s effectiveness. The audit criticized the agency for poor record keeping, sloppy internal practices, and giving awards to ineligible businesses and projects. It also said there was no way to measure the agency’s effectiveness in spurring job creation, in part because WEDC failed to follow basic standards in state law regarding the clear and proper use of taxpayer money. WEDC was created in 2011 as the successor of the state’s Commerce Department with the idea that a private agency would be more effective at encouraging business growth than a state agency. The audit painted a far different picture. As lawmakers and Walker debated how to improve WEDC, support came May 8, 2013, from state Rep. John Nygren (R-Marinette), co-chairman of the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee. He argued the agency needed more time to prove itself and said there should be no cuts to the WEDC budget because the agency was a "proven job creator." That caught our attention because it seemed to contradict the statements in the very audit that Nygren was responding to. When we asked Nygren for evidence to back up his claim, aide Jennifer Malcore said his statement was from "a local perspective." "He has talked with businesses in his district that have taken advantage of WEDC services and have increased their employees," Malcore said. That’s a narrow answer, and we’ll return to it below. But Nygren’s statement addressed the overall performance of the new agency. And that’s where we start to find trouble. About that audit For starters, even the auditors could not evaluate the effectiveness of WEDC’s job creation, noting this in their report: "The report WEDC submitted in November 2012 did not contain all required information, contained some inaccurate information, and did not clearly present information about the number of jobs created and retained as a result of its programs. For these reasons, and in the absence of verified performance information, we did not assess the effectiveness of WEDC’s economic development programs." Likewise, WEDC did not cite a number for total jobs created in its 2012 annual report. Rather, the report said that in fiscal year 2012 -- which ended June 30, and covered the agency’s first year in operation -- WEDC provided 287 "awards" worth $500 million to state companies. The incentives included tax credits, bonding and grants and loans "to companies that have or will go on to start, expand or relocate their operations in Wisconsin." The report added: "A total of 23,759 jobs in Wisconsin are anticipated to be impacted directly by investments made by WEDC in FY12." That means that the agency expects that number of people that will be hired in the future by companies that received assistance. Nygren’s statement did not involve a claim of a specific number of jobs, or compare the performance of WEDC to the old Commerce Department. So it turns largely on how successful WEDC’s performance has been in specific instances. Since it is a new agency, it’s understandable that many of its efforts have not yet led to hiring, or will lead to jobs in the future. WEDC spokesman Thomas Thieding said: "We don’t create the jobs. We help the job creators." Yet the audit pointed out that WEDC needs to do a better job of following up with companies to see how many jobs were created. "Local perspective." For the "local perspective" Nygren’s aide cited, his office directed us to seven companies. We spoke to executives from several firms, large and small. All said that financial and other assistance from WEDC was an important factor behind their decision to add workers. Here’s a synopsis: Precision Iceblast Corp. moved in early 2012 from Michigan to a building in the Peshtigo industrial park. The company deploys crews that use machines fueled by dry ice to do paint removal and other tasks, mostly in power plants and factories. Precision received $400,000 in tax credits and, in return, promised to create 64 jobs, under a contract with WEDC. In general the credits range from $3,000 to $7,000 per job, depending on the level of pay. Companies can also get credits based on a percentage of a capital investment they make. "If a company doesn't create the jobs they simply don't get the tax credits., Thieding said. "The only way tax credits are approved is if a company meets the terms of a contract." WEDC helped Precision find a suitable facility, and gave advice about expanding internationally, said Paul Lemery, vice president. "They did a lot of the grunt work for us," he said. Employment grew from 55 to about 70 now, and is on track to meet the employment goal within three years, Lemery said. "If it wasn’t for them, we would have just built in Michigan." Marinette-based Vargo Tool and Die Inc. added a new facility and seven jobs in 2012 in Peshtigo after WEDC helped, said company owner Doug Vargo. Through WEDC, Vargo received $58,000 in tax credits and promised to create 12 jobs under an agreement signed in April 2013. The company also received assistance from the city of Pesthigo in the form of a tax district. The new building has a boring mill and a large crane that allows the company to bid on additional work, Vargo said, adding that he believes employment could grow to 12 at that facility within five years. "All together, we got $700,000 from the state and Peshtigo," Vargo said. "It turned out to be a really good deal for us." Marinette Marine, one of the state’s largest employers, received $28 million in tax credits through WEDC and promised to create 1,000 jobs under an agreement signed in August 2011. WEDC "played an integral role" in Marinette’s ability to land a major federal contract as a subcontractor to Lockheed Martin Corp. to build littoral combat ships for the U.S. Navy, said Scott Wellens, Marinette Marine director of quality and facilities. He added the agency has been a "strong partner in the creation of jobs" at Marinette. The shipyard has built and delivered two of the ships and Lockheed has a contract to build a total of 10 of the ships in Marinette. WEDC’s assistance helped Marinette to be competitive in bidding for the work, Wellens said. It also helped the company establish a maritime center for excellence, which helps Marinette work with suppliers to become more efficient and competitive, he said. Marinette has added about 1,000 jobs in the past three years and has total employment of 1,750 today, Wellens said. State efforts to help the company began in the spring of 2010, under then Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle -- before Walker was elected and a year before WEDC was created. The state offered Marinette $50 million in incentives, with the promise that the company create 1,000 jobs. That was revised to $28 million under Walker "with the opportunity to expand another $10 million for another large project subject to new employee numbers," said Thieding. Our rating Nygren defended the new Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. after an audit criticized the agency’s record keeping and performance. The agency, Nygren said, was "a proven jobs creator." The Legislative Audit Bureau and the agency’s annual report say that because the agency was so poorly run it’s impossible to determine how many jobs WEDC helped create. WEDC projectsthat the agency helped create 23,759 jobs. But that’s a prediction. Nygren directed us to northeastern Wisconsin employers who received help from the agency. Of the three companies we contacted, they reported adding a total of 1,022 jobs of a promised a total of 1,076 in exchange for $28.46 million in tax credits. And WEDC doesn’t deserve sole credit for the largest employer, Marinette Marine, which added more than 1,000 jobs. The state began efforts to help Marinette well before the agency was established. So Nygren’s statement is true on the local level, but it’s impossible to measure in the broad sense. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-00773	"The founders of New Hampshire came up with the motto Live Free or Die."	false	/new-hampshire/statements/2015/apr/10/rand-paul/liberty-themed-speech-rand-paul-attributed-nh-mott/	U.S. Sen. Rand Paul invoked New Hampshire's state motto while speaking to its residents this week, seizing a chance to emphasize the idea that his libertarian-leaning ideals align with Granite State history. "When the founders of New Hampshire came up with the motto Live Free or Die, they didn't leave a lot of wiggle room," he said to a crowd in Milford's town hall in his first New Hampshire appearance since announcing his run for president. "New Hampshire founders didn’t seek out the mushy middle. They admonished you to live free." The Kentucky Republican didn't just use the phrase. He attempted to explain where it came from. And it looks like he got a little mixed up along the way. We reached out to Paul’s New Hampshire advisors, but didn’t hear back. New Hampshire was one of the original 13 states and ratified the U.S. Constitution on June 21, 1788. Before that it was formed as a royal province in 1677, and John Cutt was its first president. The words "Live Free or Die," as cited by New Hampshire law, were written by General John Stark on July 31, 1809 – long after New Hampshire became a state. A legendary military man, Stark offered the phrase as a toast. Because of his failing health, he declined an invitation to head up a reunion of the 1777 Battle of Bennington in Vermont, but left the group with those famous words. A similar invitation was extended again the following year, saying, "The toast, sir, which you sent us in 1809 will continue to vibrate with unceasing pleasure in our ears, 'Live Free or Die; Death Is Not the Worst of Evils.' " It must still have been vibrating in 1945, when the motto was formally adopted by the state Legislature. Who "the founders of New Hampshire" are depends on your definition, but Stark isn't typically considered among them. They could be the group that turned a community of towns into a "royal province" in 1679 – 49 years before Stark was born. They could also be the Congress of New Hampshire, which created in 1776 an independent constitution. Or they could be the people that ratified the U.S. Constitutiona few years later. But none of those groups included Stark. Nevertheless, a strong liberty-oriented sentiment existed in the state long before Stark, and even before it was called New Hampshire. Among the earliest explorers of New Hampshire was Captain John Smith of England, who upon seeing the land is quoted as saying, "Here should be no landlords to rack us with high rents, or extorted fines to consume us. Here every man may be a master of his own labor and land in a short time." And in 1775, less than a year before New Hampshirites drew up their own constitution, Patrick Henry uttered famous words, "Give me liberty or give me death," that people outside of New Hampshire often confuse with the state motto. Henry delivered those remarks during a speech in Virginia during the American Revolution. It’s fair to assume liberty, and independence from the the royal rule of England, was on the minds of New Hampshire’s founders at the time it became a state, but not specifically Stark’s words. New Hampshire’s motto is often invoked by politicians, like it was last month by Sen. Ted Cruz and in February by Texas Gov. Rick Perry, as the Associated Press reported. And Paul isn't the first one to get the facts about Stark wrong. In 2011, Vice President Joe Biden referred to Stark as a former New Hampshire governor. That same year, Perry referred to him as "John Spark," Holly Ramer of The Association Press reported. Our ruling Rand Paul said "the founders of New Hampshire came up with the motto Live Free or Die." New Hampshire’s motto is attributed to General John Stark, who was instrumental in defending it and the other colonies. But he wasn’t a founder of the state, and the motto wasn’t adopted until well after his death.

pomt-00476	Says Richard Cordray "secretly collected hundreds of millions of credit card accounts and mortgages. Worse, Cordray failed to protect our information. It was hacked over 200 times."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2018/aug/14/republican-governors-association/ohio-tv-ad-republican-group-misleads-attack-richar/	A Republican group says that when Richard Cordray worked for the federal government, he collected Americans’ financial data in secret and then the data was hacked. "Cordray was supposed to protect Americans from financial crime," says a TV ad by the Republican Governors Association in Ohio. "Instead, Cordray secretly collected hundreds of millions of credit card accounts and mortgages. Worse, Cordray failed to protect our information. It was hacked over 200 times. Your data compromised." The ad makes it sound like Cordray collected information on his own initiative, but it’s actually referring to Cordray’s role in the federal government as the first director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, formed under President Barack Obama over the objections of Republicans. It’s misleading to state that Cordray collected data in secret because the law allowed data collection. It’s also misleading to suggest that there was a hack, which implies an outsider broke into the data. However, there was a security breach. We’ll explain the full context. Cordray left his job at the consumer bureau in 2017, and Mick Mulvaney, a critic of the bureau, took over. Cordray is now running for Ohio governor against Republican Attorney General Mike DeWine. Did the bureau 'secretly' collect data? The 2010 Dodd-Frank Act created the bureau and gave it authority to gather and compile information from a variety of sources, such as consumer complaints, voluntary surveys, surveys and interviews with consumers and financial service providers, and reviews of available databases. The law also contained privacy provisions. We found examples dating back to 2010 of supporters and opponents commenting on the data collection. In an article in Bank Technology News, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., praised the idea of essential "real-time data collection" so that the bureau could be an "effective cop." An editorial in the Orange County Register quoted an expert who raised concerns about the bureau’s plans to collect data on consumers transactions. A federal Government Accountability Report in 2014 discussed in detail how the bureau collected data from financial institutions and financial aggregators. Jeff Sovern, who teaches consumer protection law at St. John’s University, said it would be hard to collect information about the functioning of consumer financial markets without seeing information about credit cards and mortgages. "The bureau was established in part to keep the mortgage lending that led to the Great Recession from happening again, after all," he said. The ad contained no citations for its point, although association spokesman Jon Thompson sent us news articles pertaining to both. Thompson pointed to Cordray’s testimony Jan. 28, 2014, before a House committee. U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis., asked Cordray: "Would you object to getting permission from consumers, those people who you work for, before you collect and monitor their information?" Cordray said if the bureau had to get individuals’ permission before it sought aggregate data about the credit card market, that "would have the purpose of completely making it impossible for the agency to have any kind of data to know what's going on in these markets." Todd J. Zywicki, a George Mason University law professor and critic of the bureau under Cordray, said that most Americans don’t know that their private information is transmitted from banks to the government. "In that sense, ‘secret’ seems like an accurate term to me," he said. (News reports said that the Trump administration considered Zywicki to take over the bureau.) 'Hack' at consumer protection bureau As for the claim that the information was hacked, the RGA pointed to Mulvaney’s response to a question during an April 12, 2018, Senate committee if the data had been hacked. Mulvaney replied: "I want to be careful about what I say and I'll be happy to talk about this more in private, but we have been able to document about 240 lapses in our data security." Mulvaney said an additional 800 lapses were suspected but hadn’t been confirmed. Mulvaney provided similar information in January in a letter to Warren stating that before his tenure there were 233 confirmed breaches of personally identifiable information within the bureau’s consumer response system by the bureau or contractors. To put that number in context, the consumer bureau has handled more than one million complaints. (A spokesman for the bureau provided PolitiFact with the letter sent to Warren but declined to answer questions.) Mulvaney told senators he instituted a data collection freeze and had hired an outside party to test the integrity of the system. On May 31, Mulvaney told his staff in an email that "after an exhaustive review by outside experts, including a comprehensive ‘white-hat hacking’ effort, we can lift that hold. The independent review concluded that ‘externally facing bureau systems appear to be well-secured.’" Zywicki said that the use of the term "hack" in the ad is not correct. "There have been hundreds of compromises of consumer information, but mainly they have been by inadvertently disclosing personally identifiable information by the contractors who collect the information that gets dumped into the consumer complaint database," he said. Our ruling A Republican Governors Association ad said that Richard Cordray "secretly collected hundreds of millions of credit card accounts and mortgages. Worse, Cordray failed to protect our information. It was hacked over 200 times." It’s misleading to state that the data was collected in secret when the law that established that the bureau could collect data to protect consumers. If some consumers didn’t realize the data would be collected, that doesn’t mean it was a secret. The use of the word "hack" is the wrong term -- it implies some nefarious person hacked into the data, and that’s not the case. There were breaches of personal information by the bureau or contractors. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-14315	"The barber regulation here in Missouri is 10,000 words long….the book of Revelation is (also) 10,000 words long."	true	/missouri/statements/2016/mar/30/catherine-hanaway/hanaway-isnt-exaggerating-extreme-length-missouris/	At the March 17 Republican gubernatorial debate, former Speaker of the Missouri House Catherine Hanaway managed to work barbers and the Bible into the same sentence. "The barber regulation here in Missouri is 10,000 words long. … The book of Revelation is 10,000 words long. Surely we can tell a barber how many combs to have in fewer words than it takes to describe Armageddon." What struck us about Hanaway’s claim — other than the relative importance of a barber’s toolkit and Judgment Day — was the sheer volume of regulations. Are there really 10,000 words regulating the people who cut our hair? Barbers are governed by the Board of Cosmetology and Barber Examiners, a division of the Missouri Department of Insurance, Financial Institutions and Professional Registration. So, just how long are these regulations? Well, Hanaway could’ve picked something much longer than Revelation. We copied the full statutes and regulations governing barbers and cosmetologists into GoogleDocs and the word count was nearly 60,000. Even after removing the chapters that only apply to cosmetologists, the total is about 40,000. When we ran Revelation through the word count, we came up with about 12,000. When we dove into all 60,000 words, we found that most of the regulations have to do with licensing and training requirements. In order to work as a barber in Missouri, you have to attend a barber school and earn a license. And in order to teach students to be barbers, schools have to meet certain standards. The rules also cover sanitation codes and apprenticeships. Splitting hairs Hanaway said we shouldn’t need so many words to tell a barber how many combs to have. But that’s not exactly what the regulations are for. There is no statute requiring the guy cutting your hair at Supercuts to have at least five combs. There is one rule that calls for a specific number of combs, but it applies exclusively to barber schools. Schools are required to provide their students with training kits that contain, among other things, at least four combs. A little off the top So why would Hanaway bring up an obscure barber school statute at the gubernatorial debate? It’s not the first time she's mentioned it. In 2015, Hanaway met with Phelps County Republicans and brought up the same 10,000-word figure. Her campaign website even pledges to "Start cutting away at overly long, overly burdensome regulations like the more than 10,000 words regulating our state’s barbers." We reached out to Hanaway’s campaign about why she chose to highlight barbers and heard back from Will Scharf, policy director of Hanaway for Governor. Scharf called barbers an "instructive example" of over-regulation and part of a larger plan from Hanaway to "institute a moratorium on all new non-emergency regulations" if elected. Hanaway isn’t alone in her goal of trimming barber regulations, either. In 2013, a bill that would have made earning a license optional for service providers such as barbers and cosmetologists earned support from several Republicans, but ultimately the bill failed to pass. Scharf told us that Hanaway’s views are separate from that legislation. However, if such a bill were to pass, attending a barber school would be optional and the number of combs in a toolkit made moot. Our ruling Hanaway said there are 10,000 words of regulations for barbers in Missouri, the same number that are in the book of Revelation. The Board of Cosmetology and Barber Examiners Statutes and Regulations isn’t just as long as the book of Revelation — it’s much longer. The numbers more than make her point.

pomt-00818	"Rhode Island has the second highest per enrollee (Medicaid) cost of any state in the country, which is 60 percent higher than the national average."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2015/mar/29/gina-raimondo/gov-gina-raimondo-says-ris-medicaid-costs-enrollee/	In an effort to bring Rhode Island's budget under control, Gov. Gina Raimondo is hoping to rein in the cost of Medicaid. She has proposed cutting $88 million from the state’s $2.7-billion Medicaid spending in the next fiscal year and has created a task force to "reinvent" the program. During the March 13, 2015 taping of WPRI-TV's "Newsmakers" program, Raimondo argued that the costs of the joint state and federal program that provides health insurance to the very poor are extraordinarily high in the state. "You have to remember," she said, "Rhode Island has the second highest per enrollee [Medicaid] cost of any state in the country, which is 60 percent higher than the national average. So we have to do a better job. It's just not sustainable." She made a similar statement on Rhode Island Public Radio. Paying, on average, 60 percent more for anything seems pretty scandalous. We decided to see if the typical cost of a Rhode Island Medicaid recipient was really that much higher than average, and whether per-patient costs were actually lower in 48 other states. The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation is a reliable source of data on health issues. We got a state-by-state tally of total state and federal Medicaid spending for the 2013 fiscal year and divided it by the number of people in each state on Medicaid in December 2013 in hopes of getting a rough estimate. By that back-of-the-envelope method, Rhode Island ranked fifth, not second, with all the New England states except New Hampshire in the top 10. The cost was 39 percent above the national average. But that's using 12 months of expenses and one-month enrollment totals. Laura Snyder, a senior policy analyst with Kaiser, said that's an apples-to-oranges mix. When we asked Raimondo's office for the source of her numbers, her spokeswoman cited Kaiser as well, specifically a page that directly ranks Medicaid spending per enrollee by state, although it doesn't list actual total spending or enrollment. And it's from the 2011 fiscal year. Nonetheless, on that list, Rhode Island, at $9,247 per enrollee, does indeed rank second. Only Alaska, at $9,474, spent more. In addition, per enrollee spending in Rhode Island was 60 percent higher than the $5,790 U.S. average. So, by that ranking, Raimondo is correct on both counts. We asked why newer numbers aren't available. Snyder said annual enrollment statistics by state are slow to come out from the federal government, so the 2011 data are the most recent available. Because we wondered if state rankings fluctuate significantly from year to year -- and might be significantly different in 2012, 2013 and 2014 -- we asked Kaiser to see its rankings from some previous years. They gave us data going back to 2000. It turns out that our standing has bounced around a bit, but not a lot. For example, Rhode Island ranked fifth in 2010 and 2009, but ranked first in 2007. Our ruling Raimondo said, "Rhode Island has the second highest per enrollee [Medicaid] cost of any state in the country, which is 60 percent higher than the national average." But in making her statement on one of the central elements in her proposed budget, Raimondo didn’t note that the numbers were from the 2011 year. Granted, those are the most recent statistics available, according to Kaiser. But a lot can happen in four years. Because the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rule it Mostly True.

pomt-12625	A study of where teachers apply to work found that "less than 5 percent wanted to work in rural Wisconsin."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/mar/31/tony-evers/state-school-superintendent-misses-claim-5-percent/	At a campaign stop in northern Wisconsin, State Schools Superintendent Tony Evers addressed a hot topic: the declining supply of new teachers. The trend "concerns me from the Northwoods point of view," Evers said, according to a WXPR public radio story that aired March 13, 2017. He added that a University of Wisconsin-Madison study had found that among teachers looking for work, "less than 5% wanted to work in rural Wisconsin." That’s bleak news for rural school districts -- if true. Is it? Behind the number The Evers campaign told us the statistic came from research conducted by Peter Goff, a UW-Madison professor who is leading a team studying teacher supply and demand in Wisconsin. Goff shared with us a draft version of the study, which is expected to be published soon by the Wisconsin Center for Education Research, headquartered on the campus. Evers and other DPI officials were briefed on a preliminary, 2016 version of the findings. The study by Goff and UW-Madison education graduation student Ellie M. Bruecker analyzed 194,495 applications for teaching vacancies in public school districts between January and October of 2014. The data came from a job-application website, the Wisconsin Education Career Access Network, and included those newly entering the profession as well as existing teachers. Evers comment that "less than 5 percent wanted to work in rural Wisconsin" doesn’t square with the study’s findings. Here are some key findings from the study: -- 54 percent of prospective teachers did not apply for any vacancies in a rural school. -- 40 percent applied to multiple types of districts, including rural ones. -- Less than 5 percent applied only to rural vacancies. That last conclusion reflects the claim made by Evers. But if that fact is what he was thinking of, his claim didn’t accurately reflect the report. Less than 5 percent of applicants applied exclusively to rural districts, but a total of 45 percent showed interest in rural vacancies. Goff said there is clearly an aversion to rural districts for many applicants. Another piece of evidence for that: The average applicant submits only 15 percent of their applications to rural vacancies. But, "applicant pools in rural districts don’t look any different than applicant pools in urban areas or towns," Goff told us. They have the same number of applicants, on average, with similar levels of experience, certification, advanced degrees and competitiveness of undergraduate institution. Our rating Evers claimed a study of where teachers apply to work found that "less than 5 percent wanted to work in rural Wisconsin." The study found that schools in cities, suburbs or towns all draw more interest than rural districts, but Evers badly overstated the case.

pomt-13785	"Our economy is not growing."	false	/florida/statements/2016/jul/20/rick-scott/florida-gov-rick-scott-wrongly-says-economy-not-gr/	Republican Gov. Rick Scott likes to be known as the "jobs governor" in Florida. Opening the third night of the Republican National Convention, Scott said the United States is struggling on the economic front, and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump knows how to make it strong again. "Let me tell you why this is the time for Donald to be president," Scott said. "A lot of politicians like to give speeches where they say ‘We are at a crossroads.’ That’s not really where we are today. Today America is in a terrible world, record-high debt. Our economy is not growing. Our jobs are going overseas. We’ve allowed our military to decay and we project weakness on the international stage." Trump made a similar statement about the economy at a Miami debate in March. Trump said, "GDP was zero essentially for the last two quarters," which rated False. Our fact-check will focus on Scott’s statement that the economy is "not growing." We emailed Scott’s political consultant Wednesday night and did not get a reply by deadline. Economic growth A key way to measure economic growth is the gross domestic product, or GDP, which is the sum total of a country’s economic activity. The Bureau of Economic Analysis within the U.S. Department of Commerce posts quarterly and annual GDP data for the United States. According to the data, GDP has grown every year since 2010, between 1.5 and 2.5 percent a year. The last time GDP was negative was in 2009 -- negative 2.8 percent -- amid the recession. So for the past few years, the economy has been growing — maybe just not by as much as Scott would like. To be fair, Scott isn’t alone in wishing growth were higher. As we have previously reported, there’s a common belief among economists that the United States is unlikely to see the rapid growth it experienced during the first few decades after World War II, when the country had fewer international competitors. Former 2016 Republican presidential candidate and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush faced skepticism when he laid out a goal for 4 percent growth. Quite a few Republican presidents have served during times of slow growth as well. According to a July 2014 paper by economists Alan Blinder and Mark Watson, GDP growth hovered around 2 percent during the second term of President Dwight Eisenhower; the combined second term of President Richard Nixon and the tenure of his successor President Gerald Ford; and the single term of President George H.W. Bush. And the growth rate for the second term of President George W. Bush was well below 1 percent. We interviewed three experts on the economy who disputed Scott’s claim. In addition to the growing GDP, they mentioned other positive economic signs, such as growing private sector jobs and the decline of the unemployment rate since the end of the recession. "Certainly the recovery since 2009 has not been as swift as would be ideal, but ‘not growing’ does not seem adequately supported to me," said University of California Davis history professor Eric Rauchway. The American economy has been growing since the recovery started in June 2009, said Jeffrey Frankel, a Harvard University professor of capital formation and growth who served as a Council of Economic Advisers member in the Bill Clinton administration. "Growth in GDP since then, while not as strong as we would like, has been steady," Frankel said. "And it has been clearly greater than growth in Europe or Japan." Our ruling Scott said, "Our economy is not growing." The GDP has grown between 1.5 and 2.5 percent each year since 2010. That’s perhaps not the level of growth Scott wants, but it’s misleading to say that the economy isn’t growing.

pomt-14671	Hostages were released as soon as Ronald Reagan took office because Iran perceived that America was "no longer under the command of someone weak."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/17/marco-rubio/rubio-wrongly-credits-reagan-1981-release-hostages/	As news of Iran’s release of American prisoners spread, Republicans were quick to deny President Barack Obama much credit for the deal. Presidential candidate Marco Rubio said the United States should not have made any concessions to Iran. Part of the deal included Obama granting clemency to seven Iranians charged in U.S. courts with violating economic sanctions against Iran. "Our enemies now know that if you can capture an American, you can get something meaningful in exchange for it," Rubio said on Meet the Press on Jan. 17, 2016. Host Chuck Todd pressed Rubio on that position: "So under President Rubio, you would not have negotiated any sort of prisoner exchange for those four American hostages?" Rubio replied: "When I become president of the United States, our adversaries around the world will know that America is no longer under the command of someone weak like Barack Obama, and it will be like Ronald Reagan, where as soon as he took office the hostages were released from Iran." We flagged Rubio’s comment as a misleading framing of history. Reagan’s inauguration in 1981 may have coincided with the release of the hostages, but historians say it did not cause it. Instead, the Iranians had tired of holding the hostages, and that the administration of Jimmy Carter did the legwork to get the hostages released. We asked the Rubio campaign for response but did not hear back. The hostage crisis of 1979 It’s a GOP talking point we’ve debunked before. In 2012, Republican candidate Mitt Romney said, "I believe the right course is what Ronald Reagan called peace through strength ... There's a reason why the Iranians released the hostages on the same day and at the same hour that Reagan was sworn in." We rated his claim Pants on Fire. In 1979, Islamic revolutionaries overthrew the Shah of Iran, who had been installed and supported by successive U.S. administrations. Militants took over the American embassy and held 52 American hostages from Nov. 4, 1979, until Jan. 20, 1981 -- the day Carter passed the reins to Reagan, who had defeated him amid widespread public disapproval of Carter’s handling of the crisis. But negotiations for the hostages’ release started well before Election Day. In September 1980, the Iranians contacted the Carter administration with a proposal, according to Gary Sick, a Columbia University professor and the author of October Surprise: America's Hostages in Iran and the Election of Ronald Reagan. The agreement that led to the release involved $11 billion to $12 billion in Iranian assets that Carter had frozen 10 days after the seizure of the U.S. embassy. Sick told us that the Iranians feared having to start negotiations over with a new administration and believed that they had extracted most of the benefits from holding the hostages. Carter informed Reagan at 8:31 a.m. that the release of the hostages was imminent, according to a contemporary report in the New York Times. "The hostages, whose 14 months of captivity had been a central focus of the presidential contest last year, took off from Tehran in two Boeing 727 airplanes at 12:25 p.m., Eastern standard time, the very moment that Mr. Reagan was concluding his solemn Inaugural Address at the United States Capitol," its report says. Reagan announced the news at 2:15 p.m. at a luncheon with congressional leaders in the Capitol’s Statuary Hall. So Reagan, not Carter, got to bask in the glow of the hostages’ safe return. Despite the showy announcement, scholars of the period say that Reagan did not play any significant role in freeing the hostages. "Well before Reagan became president, the deal for releasing the hostages had already been worked out by the Carter administration's State Department and the Iranians, ably assisted by Algerian diplomats," said David Farber, author of Taken Hostage: The Iranian Hostage Crisis and America's First Encounter with Radical Islam. No Reagan administration officials participated in the negotiations, Farber said, and the Iranians waited to officially release the Americans as a final insult to Carter, whom they despised. "They believed Carter had betrayed the Iranian revolution by allowing the self-exiled Shah to receive medical attention in the United States and then had threatened their new government by attempting, unsuccessfully, to use military force in April 1980 to free the hostages," Farber said. Dave Houghton, a political scientist and author of U.S. Foreign Policy and the Iran Hostage Crisis, told PolitiFact that Iran had a relatively unsophisticated grasp of U.S. politics, and that it was possible that the Iranians "didn’t even know what Reagan had said on the campaign trail." "I don't think they were scared into the release," Houghton said. "In all likelihood, they released the hostages because they needed the sanctions we'd placed on them lifted so they could finance their war with Iraq." Rubio’s comments are a misreading of history, said Michael Gunter, professor of political science at Tennessee Technological University, who has authored several papers on the 1981 hostage release. "It is clear that Sen. Marco Rubio is falling back on an exaggerated urban legend that the only way to deal with Iran is through implied threats of military retaliation, as President Reagan supposedly did," he said. "Actually, successful U.S. diplomacy then and now played the most significant role." Our ruling Rubio said that Iranian hostages were released in 1981 as Reagan took office because Iran perceived that America was "no longer under the command of someone weak." In reality, Reagan’s foreign policy approach wasn’t a factor in the hostages’ release, as scholars told us. The Carter administration negotiated the deal months before Reagan’s inauguration, without involvement by Reagan or his transition team. Rubio’s claim is an imaginative re-reading of history.

pomt-01121	Says Jeb Bush "not only opposes marriage equality, he’s said he ‘personally’ believes gay couples should be banned from adopting children."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2015/jan/05/democratic-national-committee/jeb-bush-opposes-gay-marriage-and-gays-adopting-dn/	When former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush announced he was exploring a bid to run for president, the Democrats let loose their opposition research. The Democratic National Committee released talking points it wanted Democrats to use against Bush; Politico published a leaked copy on Dec. 19. Bush then posted the talking points on his own Facebook page, denouncing the attacks as "silly" and "misleading." The DNC attacked Bush’s statements and positions on a long list of topics, saying that another Bush presidency would mean policies "that wreck the economy, that give massive breaks to the wealthy and corporations, and that are out of step with American people including women, LGBT Americans, Latinos and people of color. The reality is that Jeb Bush is no different than almost all Republicans on issue after issue." Among the talking points was this one: "Bush not only opposes marriage equality, he’s said he ‘personally’ believes gay couples should be banned from adopting children." The timing of that particular attack caught our eye, because in recent months plaintiffs have filed lawsuits to overturn Florida’s gay marriage ban, which voters approved in 2008. Federal Judge Robert Hinkle ruled in August that the ban is unconstitutional, but he stayed his order to allow for appeals. After the U.S. Supreme Court rejected requests to extend the stay, Hinkle told county clerks they will be violating the U.S. Constitution if they don’t issue same sex marriage licenses on Jan. 6. A Miami-Dade judge allowed gay marriages to proceed in that county Jan. 5. Here, we’ll look at whether the DNC was accurate in saying that Bush opposes same-sex marriage and believes gay couples should be banned from adopting children. Same-sex marriage While in office from 1999 to 2007, Bush consistently opposed gay marriage, though he was not a leading crusader against it. In 2004, Bush’s brother President George W. Bush proposed an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to ban gay marriages. At the time, Florida law did not allow for same-sex marriage, though there was no specific ban on it in the state Constitution. In 2004, 11 states approved their own gay marriage bans. A spokeswoman for the DNC pointed to an article in the Tallahassee Democrat that stated: "Bush supports his brother, President George W. Bush, in seeking a constitutional amendment to define marriage as a union of one man and one woman." Over the next few years, religious conservatives in Florida worked to get a question on the ballot banning gay marriage in the state constitution, and they succeeded in 2008. Bush faced questions about it while in office. At times, he showed some support with caveats for a state constitutional ban, but he also often said that he was reluctant to change the Constitution. "If there was a threat that gay marriage would be accepted in our state, then I might be supportive of it," Bush said in November 2004, according to the Orlando Sentinel. "I'm not sure it's necessary to do this in a pre-emptive fashion." It’s worth noting that when Bush was in office, he had plenty of company among both Republicans and Democrats in opposing gay marriage. It wasn’t until May 2012 that President Barack Obama made a Full Flop in favor of gay marriage. And it wasn’t until March 2013 that Hillary Clinton announced she now supported gay marriage. That same month Bill Clinton denounced the Defense of Marriage Act that he had signed in 1996. Gay adoption In 2001, a federal judge upheld Florida’s ban on gay adults adopting. The state argued that married heterosexuals provided a more stable home (even though the state allowed single people to adopt). Bush supported that ruling. As Bush faced re-election in 2002, the ban remained a hot topic as a challenge winded its way through federal appeals court. Bush said he was reluctant to take a stand since the issue was in court. "I think it's an issue that is marginal to the bigger issue, which is, how do we get children in loving homes?" Bush said. Bush’s position on gays adopting came up during an October 2002 debate when he faced re-election against Democratic rival Bill McBride. "If you're going to have permanency, it should be with a loving couple that is a man and a wife. That is the law of this land, it's in the courts, but I also believe that personally," Bush said. A poll done for the Orlando Sentinel during that race showed that a majority of Floridians at the time opposed gays adopting and same-sex marriages. In January 2004, a federal appeals court upheld the ban. "The decision validates Florida's conclusion that it is in the best interest of adopted children, many of whom come from troubled and unstable backgrounds, to be placed in a home anchored both by a father and a mother," Bush said in a news release. In 2010, a state appeals court struck down the ban. Bush’s comments since he left office Bush has made a few statements since he left office defending "traditional marriage" but has said little about gays adopting. In an interview with CBS’ Charlie Rose in 2012, he seemed to express some tolerance for gay parents and used softer language to talk about gay couples. "I think traditional marriage is what should be sanctioned and not at the expense of discriminating in other forms of family structure." Bush said. "So I don’t support it, but I would say that wholesome loving family life ought to be kind of the organizing principle in a free society. If we don’t want to have government overwhelm us, then we have to be self-governing. ... And if people love their children with all their heart and soul, and that’s what they do, and that’s how they organized their life, that should be held up as examples for others to follow, because we need it. We desperately need it, and that can take all sorts of forms. It doesn’t have to take the one that I think should be sanctioned under the law." In a statement to reporters at an event at Mississippi College in March 2013, he said the U.S. Supreme Court should not decide the issue: "I am a supporter of traditional marriage. I do think that these decisions should be made at the state level, so I hope the constitutional amendment in California is not overturned." (He made his comments a few months before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the federal Defense of Marriage Act and dismissed a case on Proposition 8, California’s law that banned gay marriage.) Bush told the Miami Herald on Jan. 4 in a brief interview, "It ought to be a local decision. I mean, a state decision. The state decided. The people of the state decided. But it’s been overturned by the courts, I guess." We asked a spokeswoman for Bush about his stance on gay adults adopting and marrying. Initially, we did not get a reply. But soon after we published this report, a spokesperson sent us two comments from Bush. On gay couples adopting: "Previously, I opposed gay adoption, but it has since become the law in our state, and I respect that decision." On same-sex marriage: "We live in a democracy, and regardless of our disagreements, we have to respect the rule of law. I hope that we can also show respect for the good people on all sides of the gay and lesbian marriage issue – including couples making lifetime commitments to each other who are seeking greater legal protections and those of us who believe marriage is a sacrament and want to safeguard religious liberty." Our ruling The DNC said that "Bush not only opposes marriage equality, he’s said he ‘personally’ believes gay couples should be banned from adopting children." As Bush continues to explore running for president, he may provide more specific comments about his current views, but for now we are rating the DNC’s statement based on the evidence that was available at the time they made the statement. While in office, Bush repeatedly said that he opposed gay marriage, although he was reluctant at times to amend the state Constitution since it was already banned in state law. He also opposed gay adults adopting children. Since leaving office, Bush said that he supports "traditional marriage," though he has used a softer tone when asked about it, and did so again when we asked about it. The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate this statement Mostly True. Update: Several hours after this item was first published, we received a reponse from Bush's staff, and this report has been updated to include his comments. The ruling remains the same.

pomt-04795	The Obama administration "leaked information, deliberately or otherwise, that led to the identification of the Pakistani doctor that helped us in achieving our goals and killing bin Laden."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/22/special-operations-opsec-education-fund/group-blames-obama-linking-cia-pakistani-doctor/	Some former special forces soldiers and CIA officers have produced a video that accuses President Barack Obama of trying to score political points by leaking sensitive intelligence information. The 20-minute video from the group Special Operations OPSEC (short for Operations Security) focuses on the administration’s actions surrounding the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. The group claims it isn't favoring a candidate, but it's clear Obama is being targeted. The video makes many points, including one about the arrest by Pakistan of a local doctor recruited by the CIA. "With wanton disregard," OPSEC member Jamie Williamson, a retired Special Forces colonel, says in the video, "this administration leaked information, deliberately or otherwise, that led to the identification of the Pakistani doctor that helped us in achieving our goals and killing bin Laden." Retired Maj. Gen Paul Valley follows up. "I’m not sure we have anybody in senior leadership today that understands the propriety and how risky it is on leaks," he says. Former CIA officer Fred Rustman delivers the final summation. "What was done was stupid," Rustman says. "But it was more than stupid. It was done with malice aforethought. It was done for a political purpose. And that’s what I find terrible." We are checking several claims from the video. We've previously examined the claim that the Obama administration invited filmmakers to the White House and revealed intelligence sources and methods. We ruled that Mostly False. In this item, we'll check the claim that the Obama administration leaked the doctor's name. We got no reply to several requests to the OPSEC group for facts that support their claim about the Pakistani doctor. From what we can tell, there aren’t any. Raid details emerge In the weeks after the raid, U.S. officials shared many action-packed details of the operation. The public learned about the number and type of helicopters used and the crash landing that endangered the entire mission. The administration released diagrams of the bin Laden compound where gun battles took place and the room where bin Laden was killed. The OPSEC video suggests that the administration went even further, releasing information that led to the identification and imprisonment of the Pakistani doctor. Early on, U.S. officials said that a bin Laden courier led intelligence officials to bin Laden’s house. What the U.S. did with that information was left vague. Citing an unnamed government source, the Boston Globe reported two days after the raid that "They began monitoring the site day and night with pilotless surveillance aircraft and other tools." By June, the public knew the name of the bin Laden courier and that the CIA had set up a safe-house near the bin Laden compound. The details were sketchy but it was clear that the CIA had established an operation in Abbottabad. Pakistan responds and finds a nurse The raid chilled relations with Pakistan, a key U.S. ally, because U.S. officials suspected that some Pakistani officials had been less than forthcoming in helping the U.S. track down bin Laden. Pakistan’s Directorate for Inter-Service Intelligence, often called the ISI, is the country’s FBI and CIA rolled up in one. The bin Laden raid was something of an embarrassment for the agency and top Pakistani officials. According to Saeed Shah, a reporter for McClatchy and the British newspaper the Guardian in Abbottabad, the ISI moved quickly to track down people who might have helped American intelligence agencies keep an eye on the bin Laden compound. "The ISI arrested anyone associated with the house," Shah told PolitiFact. One person they arrested was a nurse. "She boasted about having been inside the OBL house," Shah said, adding that the boast "made its way through the community and eventually to me." The ISI questioned and released the woman. It turned out she had been working for Shakil Afridi, the Pakistani doctor who was later arrested and jailed. The nurse likely led the ISI to Afridi, but it's also possible they would have been tipped off due the odd nature of a project Afridi was running. To help the CIA, Afridi had set up a fake vaccination program as a ruse to get DNA samples from the bin Laden household. A close match with a son or grandchild of bin Laden would show that family members lived in the house. Bin Laden was known to keep his family with him so if they were there, chances were good that bin Laden was too. Shah reported that Pakistan had connected Afridi with the CIA and had arrested him. Shah said he learned about Afridi from the nurse and residents of Abbotabad who knew about the vaccination program. "There was no U.S. leak on Afridi," Shah told us. To the contrary, he says, "the U.S. administration tried to stop me publishing the story, both the CIA and the State Dept, by approaching my editors at McClatchy," Shah said, "and also by appealing to me directly by telling me that it would put Afridi's life at risk." Although news reports after Shah's initial story cited a U.S. government official for confirmation, the evidence indicates that Shah's reporting came from Pakistani sources and residents. CNN’s national security analyst Peter Bergen reached the same conclusion. "It is obvious that this information was leaked not by the Americans but the Pakistanis who have done their own investigation of the bin Laden raid," Bergen wrote in a CNN opinion piece. According to Pakistan’s report on Afridi, right after the raid, his CIA handler advised him and gave him the means to leave the country. Afridi thought he didn’t need to. He is now serving a 33-year sentence -- not for helping the CIA, but for shady dealings with some local tribesmen. Our ruling The Special Operations - OPSEC Education Fund said, "This administration leaked information, deliberately or otherwise, that led to the identification of the Pakistani doctor that helped us in achieving our goals and killing bin Laden." The OPSEC group provides no evidence to support its claim, and journalists close to the scene in Abbottabad say it was the Pakistanis, not the Americans, who identified the doctor. The bin Laden raid triggered the ISI investigation, not anything said by U.S. officials. In fact, the CIA had urged the doctor to leave the country and when Pakistan provided the name of the doctor, US officials tried to prevent it being published. We see no evidence that it was the Obama administration that leaked the name. We rate it False.

pomt-02457	Says Alaska Sen. Mark Begich "is on record supporting a carbon tax, even pushing Harry Reid to make it a priority."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/feb/25/americans-prosperity/conservative-ad-says-begich-supports-carbon-tax/	Conservative political advocacy group Americans For Prosperity is spending $400,000 into a TV ad attacking U.S. Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, for his position on a potential carbon tax. "Sen. Begich hasn’t always been straight with us," the narrator claims as footage of him supporting Obamacare flashes across the screen. "And now he’s at it again. Begich is on record supporting a carbon tax, even pushing Harry Reid to make it a priority." PolitiFact wanted to find out if the ad accurately reflects Begich’s position on the carbon tax. A carbon tax would impose a tax or fee on oil, gas and coal usage. The idea is that by making natural resources costlier for individuals and businesses to use, a carbon tax would encourage the use of alternative energy sources. Most economists agree that a carbon tax would be effective, but the issue hasn’t gained much political traction. Because Congress hasn’t come close to passing such a tax, many of the logistics are still up in the air. How Begich has voted Americans For Prosperity pointed us to a couple of amendments to Senate budget resolutions from 2013 as examples of Begich supporting a carbon tax. Begich voted in favor of an amendment to last year’s budget resolution put forth by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., who has expressed support for implementing a carbon tax. That amendment failed, but it would’ve called for revenue generated by a carbon tax to be given back to the public in some form. Nothing in that amendment would actually enact a carbon tax. Rather, the amendment offered a rough framework for how money generated from such a tax, if one were enacted, would be put to use. "I think that ultimately a fee on carbon pollution is inevitable, and the purpose of that amendment was to begin a discussion on that and begin the discussion about when that happens, what the best way to use the proceeds of the fee are," Whitehouse told reporters in September. "So from that point of view, I didn’t view it as binding anybody on a carbon fee, but I did view it as an assessment of the best way of using carbon fee proceeds." So although Begich’s vote wasn’t directly in support of a carbon tax, he was allying himself with a carbon tax supporter’s amendment that could make such a tax more politically palatable. The other vote Americans For Prosperity cited is from an amendment proposed by Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., which also failed. This amendment would have increased the threshold for passing a carbon tax framework within the budget resolution to 60 votes. Begich voted against this amendment, even as some of his Democratic colleagues from energy producing states voted for it. Still, by voting against this, he wasn’t directly expressing support for a carbon tax. Begich’s letter to Reid As for "pushing Harry Reid to make it a priority," Americans For Prosperity pointed to a letter Begich and other Democratic senators wrote to Sen. Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., in 2010. Generally speaking, the letter calls for reform to U.S. energy policy to encourage clean energy: "While fossil fuels are and will continue to be an important part of our economy, we believe the transition to a clean energy economy -- one that includes an all-of-the-above approach -- is an economic, national security and environmental priority." The term "carbon tax" doesn’t appear in the letter. However, Americans for Prosperity zeroed in on the following line: "We believe the scale of this challenge dictates the need for a comprehensive solution that includes making polluters pay through a price on greenhouse gas emissions." A carbon tax could be one way to levy "a price on greenhouse gas emissions." Another way, though, would be through a cap-and-trade program. Begich’s campaign spokesman told PolitiFact that the letter he signed was meant to further a general conversation about climate change. The Hill reported that Begich has "expressed skepticism" about a carbon tax without expressing either explicit support or opposition. Begich acknowledges climate change in general is real and should be addressed by Congress. We’ve also noted that he sometimes breaks with the White House when it comes to taxes on the oil and gas industry. His campaign office put it this way to PolitiFact: "Begich has not supported a carbon tax in the past." Our ruling Americans for Prosperity said "Begich is on record supporting a carbon tax, even pushing Harry Reid to make it a priority." Begich voted on an amendment that said if there is a carbon tax, the revenue generated by a carbon tax to be given back to the public in some form.The letter to Reid said that energy policy should be aimed at putting some sort of price on greenhouse gas emissions, without specifically saying it should be a carbon tax. Begich’s campaign said he’s never explicitly supported a carbon tax. If you were counting votes in the U.S. Senate for a straightforward carbon tax and looked at Begich's record for how he might vote, you'd likely put Begich in the "maybe" column. Americans for Prosperity exaggerated in saying that Begich is "on record" supporting a carbon tax. So we rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-08909	Democratic candidate Jeff Greene "ran for Congress as a California Republican."	true	/florida/statements/2010/jul/28/kendrick-meek/greene-ran-republican-28-years-ago/	Congressman Kendrick Meek attacked his Democratic opponent Jeff Greene in a new political ad set to a disco beat. The ad, called "He's the Man," is Meek's first TV attack on Greene in their U.S. Senate race. The narration goes like this: "Meet the real Jeff Greene: Ran for Congress as a California Republican. Moved to Florida two years ago. Became a billionaire on Wall Street betting middle-class families would lose their homes. Helped fuel the economic meltdown. Warren Buffet called Greene's scheme 'financial weapons of mass destruction.'" The ad then shows footage of Greene saying, "They'll attack me for my friends and my past when I was single. Some of it's true, but none of it matters." "Betting on suffering does matter," the narrator responds. We previously fact-checked similar claims from Meek that Greene was responsible for hurting the economy. We looked at Meek's statement that Greene "is the king of the undercover Credit Default Swap that brought about the destruction of our economy that we have right now." We rated that Barely True. We researched Greene's activities thoroughly, and found that Greene did make a lot of money on credit default swaps that paid off when mortgage-backed securities failed. But we also found that Meek was pumping up Greene's role in a complicated economic situation where many different financial players did things to hurt the economy. (Read the full report.) We also fact-checked the claim that Greene moved here only two years ago. We rated that True. Here, we're checking Meek's claim that Greene ran for Congress as a California Republican. The history here dates back to 1982. Greene was 28 years old and living in California. He ran as a Republican for Congress, for a seat representing the Los Angeles area. But he came in second in the primary with 28.2 percent of the vote. The winner was David Armor, who won 43.9 percent. The Miami Herald recently tracked down Armor, who was then a 43-year-old social scientist; now he's a professor of public policy at George Mason University in Virginia. Armor won the primary but lost the general election to then-incumbent Democrat Anthony Beilenson. Armor's recollection is that Greene put out a flier attacking him as an "aging Berkeley radical," based on Armor's time as a student activist at University of California at Berkeley. "It was a hit piece claiming I was a deceiving the people,'' Armor told the Herald. "Being in my 40s, I think I was more offended at being called 'aging' than a 'radical.' " Greene doesn't dispute that he ran for Congress as a Republican. "For a year of my life I was a Republican, and then I quickly got back to what I really believed in,'' he told the Herald in June. What's not clear is how long Greene stayed a Republican. PolitiFact Florida examined Greene's voting history last month, contacting voting officials around the country. The Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk told us that Greene registered as a Republican with an address in the city of Los Angeles in 1982. In 1992, he re-registered with an address in Malibu with a party affiliation of "Decline to State." If Greene changed his party affiliation shortly after the 1982 run, officials were unable to provide documentation of that. Still, the record on Greene's run for Congress as a Republican is undisputed. It was 1982, which was 28 years ago. We rate Meek's statement True.

pomt-09991	"President Obama is actually increasing Bush-era defense spending by $21 billion in the new fiscal year."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/apr/13/keith-olbermann/olbermann-right-about-base-defense-spending/	In response to Republican complaints that the Obama administration is gutting the military, MSNBC's Keith Olbermann fired back, saying that Obama is actually increasing defense spending. "GOP lawmakers (are) falsely accusing the president of gutting the Pentagon’s budget, when in fact President Obama is actually increasing Bush-era defense spending by $21 billion in the new fiscal year," Olbermann said on his Countdown program on MSNBC. Defense Secretary Robert Gates announced April 6, 2009, that he planned an overhaul of military spending, reducing the amount on big-ticket items such as the F-22 fighter plane and shifting more money toward new technology and troops. That led to Republican complaints that Gates was gutting defense, which in turn led to Olbermann's comments. "Representatives in Congress (are) wildly and falsely mischaracterizing that as making cuts to the military's budget," Olbermann said. "A) Afghanistan and Iraq spending, that is all in a separate budget . You could look that up. B) In the final year of the Bush administration, the defense budget was $513 billion. In fiscal year 2010 it will be $534 billion. That would be more. In fact, it's an increase of $21 billion, not a cut. As they say, do the math." Olbermann grabs his figures straight from the Obama administration's proposed 2010 budget , which calls for a 4 percent increase in base funding for defense. That would, in fact, increase the base defense budget from the 2009 enacted level of $513.3 billion to $533.7 billion. There are a couple caveats here. Base defense spending does not include the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as Olbermann noted. Spending for the wars comes through supplemental budgets. To calculate the cost of defense including the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan requires a little math. During the first half of this fiscal year, President Bush secured $66 billion in supplemental funding for the wars, fully aware that a second supplement would be needed from the new president. Obama has requested an additional $83 billion supplement (although $7 billion of that is for foreign aid). So $142 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan in 2009. Together with base defense spending of $513 billion, it comes to total 2009 military spending of $655 billion. Obama's proposed budget calls for $534 billion in base defense spending and estimates a "placeholder" amount of $130 billion to fund the wars overseas. Total estimated military spending for 2010: $664 billion. That's a long way of explaining that if you include the costs of the wars, there's an overall $9 billion increase in defense spending under the Obama budget. There's another caveat, said Todd Harrison, fellow for defense budget studies at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. Obama's base defense budget appears to include some things that in the past were included in supplemental war funding. For example, Gates said $2 billion in his proposed budget to increase intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance support for the war — including 50 Predator and Reaper unmanned aerial vehicles — would be permanently funded in the base budget. As well it probably should, Harrison said. But for comparison purposes, it inflates the base military spending next year. Details of the defense budget have not yet been released, Harrison said, but he suspects there may be lots of other spending like that which would skew defense spending comparisons. Brian Riedl, a research fellow in federal budget policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that while Obama's defense budget may go up a little, some parts of defense spending will go up while other parts go down. And, he said, Republican opponents may be right that procurement spending will go down even as the net defense budget goes up. "The short answer is that they both may be right," Riedl said. Marc Goldwein, policy director of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, added that looking at next year's budget isn't the only test of whether the defense will be "gutted" as some have claimed. Many of the procurement changes proposed by Gates won't be felt for years, he said. "It's hard to cut spending really quickly," Goldwein said. "It would have very little effect in 2010. But it could have an effect going forward." There are lots of ways to calculate how much the nation spends on defense, and some methods can be skewed if you include the cost for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. So we think Olbermann was on pretty solid footing when he cited the budget numbers for base defense spending. But there's an important caveat because the 2010 cost may include things that weren't part of the 2009 number. We can't know exactly how much of that has happened because the administration has not released a detailed budget yet. So for now, we rule Olbermann's comment Mostly True.

pomt-08106	Says Joe Straus "was co-author of a bill that would have allowed Planned Parenthood to control public school sex education."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2010/dec/13/donna-garner/conservative-education-activist-donna-garner-says-/	Blasting House Speaker Joe Straus, R-San Antonio, as a "Republican in name only," the conservative Texas Eagle Forum says "he has much more in common with the Democrats." In a Nov. 9 newsletter, the group urges Texans to tell their state representative to vote for one of the other Republicans running for speaker. Legislators will choose the speaker for 2011-12 after the biennial legislative session convenes in January. In a section challenging Straus' conservative bonafides, the newsletter says he "was co-author of a bill that would have allowed Planned Parenthood to control public school sex education." Really? Some background: Planned Parenthood is a reproductive health care provider with facilities nationwide that offer family-planning services, including abortion. The organization advocates for comprehensive sexual health care and education. When we sought backup for the statement, Pat Carlson, president of the Texas Eagle forum, noted that the claim originated with Donna Garner of Hewitt, a retired teacher and a conservative education activist. Next, Garner told us via e-mail she was referring to House Bill 1842, a 2007 measure titled the "Prevention First Act," which cleared a committee but died before the full House could take it up. Straus was one of its 14 co-authors. In an e-mail, Garner guided us to a May 2007 analysis of the legislation by the House Research Organization, a nonpartisan arm of the Texas House. According to the analysis, the legislation directed the state to promote family-planning services for low-income women and required school districts that provide sex education — including instruction on contraceptives — to explain the difference in effectiveness between correct and incorrect use of contraceptives. Garner stressed a section in the bill analysis outlining opponents' arguments against the bill. Among them: the proposed changes in how schools teach students about contraceptives would thwart efforts to promote abstinence and require detailed discussions about how to put on a condom. The legislation also described "abstinence-only instruction" to mean instruction that doesn't "include information about preventing pregnancy, sexually-transmitted diseases," HIV and AIDS through any means other than abstinence. Opponents argued that the definition should reflect the definition that appears in Title V of the Social Security Act. The federal law describes abstinence-only instruction as teaching that abstinence is the expected standard for all school-age children and teaches that sexual activity outside of marriage is likely to have harmful psychological and physical effects, among other points, according to the bill analysis. Again in an e-mail, Garner told us that "Straus' bill was meant to force teachers to emphasize condom/contraceptive use to students which would have, in turn, de-emphasized Title V guidelines that emphasize abstinence-only sex education.... changes in his bill would have resulted in a shift in the way sex education has been taught under Title V in the public schools in Texas." But we found no language in the act potentially putting Planned Parenthood in charge of sex education in Texas. The legislation did not change current law that requires each school district's board and local advisory council of parents and community representatives to review course materials dealing with sexuality, and to comply with a list of restrictions as to how the courses can be taught, with emphasis on abstinence. Garner told us: "If Straus had been a true conservative, he would not have supported H.B. 1842. His deep roots (and those of his wife) with Planned Parenthood undoubtedly led to his being a co-author of this bill. It is no surprise that Planned Parenthood in its fall 2009 Horizon newsletter publicly highlighted Joe Straus' support of its agenda." Straus' wife was on the board of directors of the Planned Parenthood Trust of San Antonio and South Central Texas in the early 1990s, according to a January 2009 Austin American-Statesman news article. Finally, we consulted folks across the ideological spectrum about whether the proposed legislation would have allowed Planned Parenthood to control public-school sex education. In the "no" camp: Rochelle Tafolla, a spokeswoman at Planned Parenthood of Houston and Southeast Texas told us "the statement is not at all accurate." She did say Planned Parenthood, which has pushed "for broader access to medically-accurate, comprehensive sex education and affordable family planning services," supported the legislation. One of the bill's five authors, Rep. Mark Strama, D-Austin, told us that Planned Parenthood was supportive of the legislation and was among the groups the authors consulted in drafting it. But he said that the legislation would not have allowed Planned Parenthood to control public school sex education. Tracy Young, a spokeswoman for Straus, also called Garner's statement "inaccurate," and told us that the bill would have required HHSC to conduct an education outreach campaign to promote the reduction of unintended pregnancies and sexually-transmitted diseases. Kyleen Wright, president of the pro-life group Texans for Life who was listed as a witness against the bill, told us that "it's obviously a stretch to say it gives Planned Parenthood control of sex education." She said the legislation left the proposed outreach-campaign funding in the hands of the state. "It certainly didn't hand (Planned Parenthood) sex education in the state," she said. We got a different take from Jonathan Saenz, director of legislative affairs at the right-leaning Liberty Institute. He told us he thought Garner's claim was valid. "If Planned Parenthood (working through an elected official) has control and/or influence over changes to our statewide law governing how sex education is taught, changes that result in a version of sex education and related women's services that Planned Parenthood desires, approves of, and lobbies for, then they effectively have control of public sex education," he said in a statement. Our finding: In 2007, Straus co-authored a measure intended to promote family planning and to ensure that school districts that teach sex education spell out the effectiveness of contraceptives when used properly and not. Planned Parenthood supported the proposal and worked on the bill with Strama's office, but even if it had passed, it would not have changed the state-mandated, pro-abstinence focus on sex education in Texas schools. Garner can argue that legislation would have changed the education code to align more with Planned Parenthood's values than her own, but to say that it would have put the organization at the helm of sex education in public schools is an over-the-top claim. We rate her statement as Pants on Fire.	None	Donna Garner	None	None	None	2010-12-13T06:00:00	2010-12-09	['Joe_Straus']
pomt-09685	"The public option is not funded with public money. It's funded with private insurance premiums."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/13/diana-degette/degette-claims-public-option-will-be-privately-fun/	Amid debate over a health reform bill, the House adopted new restrictions on funding abortions, and Democratic congresswoman Diana DeGette is not happy about the development. As chairwoman of the Pro-Choice Caucus, DeGette of Colorado is upset that under the bill low-income individuals would not be able to use federal subsidies to buy abortion coverage through a health insurance exchange. Furthermore, a government-run health insurance option would not offer abortion coverage except in the case of rape, incest or when the life of the mother is endangered. Here's what she had to say about the issue on the Nov. 9, 2009, episode of the Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC. "Nobody in the public option would be able to get an insurance policy that offered abortion coverage," she said. "And we need to remember, the public option is not funded with public money. It's funded with private insurance premiums. So, let's say you have a small business owner who goes in to the public option because they can't get insurance anyplace else, and they want to buy a policy with their own private money, no federal money, that they would be banned from doing that." We've already explored the second part of DeGette's claim, that small businesses and individuals would not be able to buy abortion coverage through the exchange, and found it to be False. In fact, insurers can still offer abortion coverage through the exchange so long as the administrative structure behind it is not supported by federal money, and individuals can buy abortion coverage through the exchange so long as they use their own money. So, for this fact-check, we'll focus on DeGette's other point -- that the public option is funded by private insurance premiums, not public money. The public option has turned out to be the most controversial part of the health care reform. It's a government-run option for people buying insurance on the individual market, not through their employer, and it would be one of many plans offered through a new insurance exchange -- think of it as a one-stop shop for consumers where they can compare costs and benefits between plans. The hope is to increase competition and accountability within the insurance industry. So far, the Senate version of the bill does not include a public option, but Democratic Leader Harry Reid says the bill that comes to the Senate floor will likely include such a plan. The public option has become a flashpoint between Republican opponents of the bill and its Democratic advocates, in part because members of the GOP see it as a government effort to socialize medicine and too expensive. And now that the House has adopted an amendment that officially severed any ties between the public option and abortion coverage, tension between lawmakers on both sides of the abortion debate has only intensified. DeGette's point is that the public plan isn't really public at all because it will be sustained through premiums paid by consumers, so it should not exclude abortion coverage. We looked into exactly how the public option would be funded, and here's what we found: According to the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over the plan, the public option would be administered through the Department of Health and Human Services, and it would negotiate rates with providers in the public option. To make sure the public plan doesn't have an unfair advantage, the bill requires that the plan be self-sustaining; funding would come from the premiums consumers pay to get coverage. But the feds aren't exactly off the hook. The government will front the operation $2 billion to cover initial administrative costs and claims, though lawmakers expect that sum will be recouped after the program has been in operation for 10 years. So DeGette is right and she's wrong. In the long-term, the public option is meant to be self-sustaining. But first, it will require a big chunk of of public money to get started.

pomt-10263	The U.S. energy policy is to "borrow money from China to buy oil from countries that don't like us."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/26/mark-warner/not-just-china-other-countries-too/	In a keynote speech to the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Mark Warner argued that America is on the wrong track. "When we look around today, we see that for too many Americans that fair shot is becoming more of a long shot," said Warner, a candidate for the U.S. Senate from Virginia and the state's former governor. "Two wars, a warming planet, an energy policy that says let's borrow money from China to buy oil from countries that don't like us," Warner said. "How many people look at these things and wonder what the future holds for them?" We don't think Warner meant it literally, as if it were written down somewhere, when he said our policy is to "borrow money from China to buy oil from countries that don't like us." But we do think he meant that's what's happening. We talked to economists about this issue earlier this year when we looked at other claims on the campaign trail; read our story "Mix 'n match creditors with causes." Here's what it comes down to, according to the economists we interviewed: As a country, we spend more than we make, and we don't have much in savings either. So collectively we have been borrowing from foreign countries to pay our bills. One of the important indicators of countries that lend us this money is the list of foreign countries holding U.S. Treasury securities. The U.S. government issues Treasury securities to finance its debt. In laymen's terms, these are simply IOUs that guarantee repayment with interest. Many U.S. citizens buy them, often in the form of U.S. bonds, but so do many foreign countries, who see them as a safe, stable investment. The No. 1 holder of U.S. Treasury securities among foreign countries isn't China. It's actually Japan. China is No. 2, the United Kingdom is No. 3, and a group of oil-producing countries (which includes Saudi Arabia) is No. 4. The bonds the government sells are not program-specific, so there is no direct relationship between the holder of bonds and any particular expense of the U.S. government. Warner could have easily said that Japan or the United Kingdom is lending us money to pay for oil, and that would have been just as true as what he did say. Economists also caution against linking our country's foreign debt to our dependency on foreign-produced oil. "I don't think that there is any link between oil prices causing the low saving of American households or the government's budget deficits. Both preceded the rise in oil prices," said Barry Bosworth, an economist with the Brookings Institution whom we interviewed earlier this year. "Some people will prefer a solution that increases energy supply and others will argue that it is time to reduce demand. I don't think the lack of saving will play much of a role." Finally, let's look at the last part of Warner's statement, that we're buying oil "from countries that don't like us." Objectively speaking, we're not sure how they feel about us, but we do know who Americans think are our enemies. A Gallup Poll earlier this year found that Americans believe the following countries are our greatest enemies: Iran - 25 percent; Iraq - 22 percent; China - 14 percent; North Korea/Korea - 9 percent; United States itself - 3 percent; Afghanistan - 3 percent; Pakistan - 2 percent; Russia - 2 percent; Saudi Arabia - 1 percent; Venezuela - 1 percent; Other - 6 percent. The country we buy the most oil from is Canada, according to the Energy Information Administration. No. 2 is Mexico, followed by Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Nigeria, Algeria, Angola, Iraq and Russia. So Americans consider only about four of these nine countries their enemies, for what that's worth. Warner is right in some of the larger themes he's expressing. The United States does borrow more than it saves, and we import large quantities of oil to satisfy our energy needs. But the two phenomena aren't causally related. And you could just as easily say that we're borrowing from a number of other countries to pay for oil. For these reasons, we find his statement Half True.

pomt-03977	"I was never against same-sex marriage."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2013/feb/13/leah-ward-sears/ex-chief-justices-opinion-same-sex-marriage-hard-g/	The national debate over same-sex marriage has forced most politicians to pick a position. But one well-known figure in Georgia’s legal community says she has avoided taking a stance on the issue for personal and professional reasons. Former Georgia Supreme Court Chief Justice Leah Ward Sears recently wrote a column in Fulton County’s Daily Report. She praised a group called the Institute for American Values for its recent decision to separate from its past position of opining on same-sex marriage.The mission of the conservative, New York-based organization is to "study and strengthen civil society." Its president, David Blankenhorn, has been a vocal opponent of same-sex marriage, while other board members have been more supportive on the issue. He wrote a book in 2007, "The Future of Marriage," which included his belief that children need a mother and a father. Last year, Blankenhorn described his revised views on same-sex marriage in a New York Times column. Blankenhorn stands by his book, but is now more focused on strengthening the institution of marriage, regardless of the genders involved. "I'm pleased with the direction the Institute is taking," wrote Sears, who has been a board member of the group for several years. "Unlike David, I was never against same-sex marriage. But much like David, I've witnessed the fallout from broken families in the past several decades, during which divorce and out-of-wedlock births have skyrocketed, and unstable, serial cohabiting relationships have become the norm for raising children." PolitiFact Georgia wondered if Sears, whose name frequently appears on lists when there is an important judicial opening, has never opposed same-sex marriage. Sears, a partner at the law firm Schiff Hardin's Atlanta office, was reportedly on the shortlist of candidates for the U.S. Supreme Court a few years back. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s Political Insider blog posted an item about Sears’ column and noted that there are three openings on the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which decides cases in Alabama, Florida and Georgia. Sears told PolitiFact Georgia she’s "not vying for anything." Sears told us that she’s been purposefully careful not to offer a position on same-sex marriage, particularly when she was on the bench. "By having grown up African-American and female, I wanted to be careful and sensitive to the rights of our gay and lesbian citizens," she said. In 2009, an Associated Press story noted that Sears was criticized by gay rights groups, such as Georgia Equality, for joining the Institute for American Values, because of Blankenhorn’s publicly stated opposition to same-sex marriage. "Anytime someone joins the board of an organization, I think it’s kind of implied that they support the positions of that organization," Georgia Equality Executive Director Jeff Graham told PolitiFact Georgia about his group’s criticism of Sears at the time. Despite their criticism, Graham was not aware of any instance in which Sears had publicly stated her position on the issue. Sears said her role at the institute would build on her work with the Georgia Supreme Court toward "strengthening the institution of marriage," by working to reduce the nation’s divorce rate. (The AP reporter who reported that story now works for the AJC. PolitiFact Georgia checked with him about the piece, and he assured us his reporting was accurate.) While she was under consideration for the U.S. Supreme Court, it was noted that Sears had addressed same-sex marriage only indirectly, writing in an opinion that alimony should not be reduced for someone who entered into a homosexual relationship the same way it might be if the person had remarried, because such relationships did not enjoy the same legal protections as marriage. In a 2008 interview with the AJC, Sears was asked if her attendance at a conference on marriage was an indication that she is against same-sex marriage. "We will have a one-hour debate on same-sex marriage which I will facilitate, and I have no view," Sears said as part of her answer. "I've included it as a small part of the conference because I didn't want people to think I was afraid of it." In addition to reviewing Sears’ public statements (or lack of public statements) on the issue, PolitiFact Georgia also reviewed her legal history. She ruled with the Georgia Supreme Court in throwing out the state’s hate-crimes law in 2004 as "unconstitutionally vague"; reinstating Georgia’s gay-marriage ban in 2006; and declining to hear an appeal from a biological mother who wanted to terminate the parental rights of her former lesbian partner in 2007, and in 2004 opposed the state Legislature’s successful attempt to place an anti-same-sex marriage amendment on the ballot. During her Georgia Supreme Court re-election campaign in 1998, one of her two opponents spread the idea that Sears supported same-sex marriage. Sears declined comment; her campaign manager said Sears’ statements used in the accusations were taken out of context. So where does former Georgia Supreme Court Justice Leah Ward Sears stand on same-sex marriage? Earlier this month, she said in a newspaper column that she was "never against same-sex marriage." Never is pretty definitive and PolitiFact Georgia sets the bar high when someone is absolute about whether they’ve said or claimed they’ve never made a particular statement. Sears was careful not to enter the controversial fray during her time on the bench, and from the research we reviewed, she had not taken a public stance on the issue. Still, she went to work a few years ago for a conservative think tank whose leader has been a staunch same-sex opponent, and she told PolitiFact Georgia that she is grappling with her position on the issue. In addition, her legal record while on the Georgia Supreme Court shows she has sided with the majority on rulings that have been cheered and jeered by gay rights activists. We ruled her statement Mostly True. Staff writer Karishma Mehrotra contributed to this article.	None	Leah Ward Sears	None	None	None	2013-02-13T06:00:00	2013-02-05	['None']
pomt-09904	"Obama's Justice-designate Sotomayor threw out (the New Haven firefighters') lawsuit in a sneaky, unsigned opinion -- the judicial equivalent of 'talk to the hand.'"	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/10/ann-coulter/ann-coulter-wrong-about-sotomayor-unsigned-opinion/	Columnist Ann Coulter wrote recently that Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor tried to hide her participation in a controversial race discrimination case involving firefighters in New Haven, Conn. In a July 1, 2009, column in Human Events headlined "So much for wise Latinas," Coulter wrote that "Sotomayor threw out their lawsuit in a sneaky, unsigned opinion — the judicial equivalent of 'talk to the hand.'" This part of Coulter's claim is right: The opinion was unsigned. But the truth stops there. In legal terms, "unsigned" means the ruling was "per curiam," or "for the court" — simply, that everyone on the panel agreed with the decision and decided to issue a single opinion. "Generally, an 'unsigned' opinion means the opinion was issued per curiam, meaning no one judge took credit for authoring the opinion, but it represents the opinion of the court," Sarah Ricks, a law professor at Rutgers University who has analyzed types of judicial opinions, wrote us in an e-mail interview. Ricks added that "it is not unusual for a federal appellate court to issue a per curiam opinion; even the Supreme Court very occasionally issues a per curiam opinion. ... A per curiam opinion does not preclude separate opinions by members of the court but it does represent the reasoning for the judgment of the court." Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, said that "unsigned just means that the three judges agree not to have one author, but all three are agreeing to what the opinion says. It is not uncommon and it is not sneaky. All three judges stand behind the opinion, signed or not." In Ricci vs. DeStefano, more than a dozen white firefighters, as well as one Hispanic, sued New Haven, Conn., for discrimination after the city threw out the results of its lieutenant and captain exams because black firefighters performed disproportionately poorly and wouldn't have been promoted. A federal district court judge found in 2006 that the city was justified. The firefighters appealed, and the case was assigned to a three-judge panel of the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals that included Sotomayor. In February 2008, the panel issued a summary order, without comment, upholding the lower court's finding. Another 2nd Circuit judge asked the full appeals court to rehear the case, but the court's other judges declined. After that, Sotomayor and her two colleagues on the panel, Rosemary Pooler and Robert Sack, issued a new "per curiam" order that adopted the lower court's ruling as their own, calling it "thorough, thoughtful, and well-reasoned." They also added two paragraphs expressing sympathy for the firefighters who passed the exam but who were not promoted. "In this case, the Civil Service Board found itself in the unfortunate position of having no good alternatives," they wrote. "We are not unsympathetic to the (white firefighters') expression of frustration." So Coulter — an attorney who is billed as the "legal affairs correspondent for Human Events — is seriously distorting what the judges did. The term "unsigned" has nothing to do with judges trying to duck responsibility for the ruling. The suggestion that appellate court judges could somehow hide their participation is preposterous — the judges' names are on every opinion they issue, unsigned or not. In fact, their names are right near the top. So we find Coulter's claim False.	None	Ann Coulter	None	None	None	2009-07-10T17:26:41	2009-07-01	['New_Haven,_Connecticut', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-09423	"A government panel that didn't include cancer specialists says women shouldn't receive mammograms until age 50...If government takes over health care, recommendations like these could become the law for all kinds of diseases."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/16/americans-prosperity/ad-claims-if-health-reform-bill-passes-government-/	A new TV ad from Americans for Prosperity, a group opposing the health reform bill, suggests that screening mammograms for women under 50 would be in jeopardy if the bill passes. The ad, running in 18 key congressional districts through March 18, 2010, features an appeal from breast cancer survivor Tracy Walsh of North Augusta, S.C. "I was diagnosed with breast cancer when I was 43," Walsh begins. "My mother died of cancer. But early detection saved my life. Now a government panel, that didn't include cancer specialists, says women shouldn't receive mammograms until age 50. That saves money, but could cost your life. If I had followed the new government guidelines on mammograms, my cancer would have spread undetected, and my chances of survival would have been reduced. If government takes over health care, recommendations like these could become the law for all kinds of diseases." There's an awful lot of misinformation and distortion packed into to these few sentences, and we'll have to take them one at a time. But first, some background. In November 2009, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force issued controversial recommendations regarding breast cancer screenings, including one that challenged the long-standing convention that women between the ages of 40 and 50 should get routine mammograms. Specifically, the task force dropped the need for regular mammography screenings for women between 40 and 50 from a Grade B to a Grade C. Grade B means there is "high certainty that the net benefit is moderate or there is moderate certainty that the net benefit is moderate to substantial" and therefore the screening is recommended. Grade C, however, means that there is "at least moderate certainty that the net benefit is small." As a result, the task force recommended against routinely providing the screening unless "other considerations support the offering or providing the service in an individual patient." Enter the Senate version of the health care bill (which is largely the working bill for now). It would create a health care exchange for people who do not get their insurance through their employer. Among other intended benefits, it would allow people in the so-called individual market to get group rates. Private health insurance companies that wish to compete for business in the exchange would have to offer a minimum package of coverage described in the bill. And among those minimum standards, they'd have to cover the entire cost of "evidence-based items or services that have in effect a rating of 'A' or 'B' in the current recommendations of the United States Preventive Services Task Force." That's the underpinning of the argument from Americans for Prosperity. Now, to unravel some of the distortion. First and foremost, the task force did not say women shouldn't receive mammograms until age 50. Diana Petitti, former vice chair of the task force, said the report has been wildly misrepresented on this point. "The report says that when you hit 40, you should start having conversations with your physician about whether you want to have a mammogram," she said. "There is no reason they shouldn't get a mammogram if they decide to get a mammogram. There is nothing in it that attempts to deny or affect the coverage for mammograms for women aged 40 to 49." The report found there was insufficient backing to support the idea that routine mammograms should be automatic for all women 40 to 50, but it noted that there were many women for whom they would be appropriate, and that "the decision to start regular, biennial screening mammography before the age of 50 years should be an individual one and take patient context into account, including the patient's values regarding specific benefits and harms." Among those who should get routine mammograms under 50? Women with a history of cancer in their family, like Walsh, Petitti said. Dr. Petitti also takes umbrage at Walsh's claim that the panel didn't include cancer specialists. She is the former vice chair of the Institute of Medicine National Cancer Policy Board and vice chair of an Institute of Medicine committee that issued a report, "Beyond Mammography." Dr. Allen Dietrich is director of Population Sciences at an NCI-designated Cancer Center at Dartmouth-Hitchcock medical center. And Dr. Sanford Schwartz has also published on the topic of mammography, she noted. In addition, she said, the recommendations were reviewed by oncologists, including a preventive oncologist, and by radiologists. The task force was established to provide an "independent voice" and "sound, evidence-based recommendations for preventive services," said Alina Salganicoff, vice president and director of women's health policy at the independent Kaiser Family Foundation. As for Walsh's comment that not providing mammograms "saves money, but could cost your life," we note that cost-effectiveness was not one of the criteria considered by the task force. It only analyzed the benefits -- early detection of cancer -- against the potential downsides of screening -- mainly stress caused from false-positive test results and the risk of exposure to radiation -- regardless of cost. In short, the panel concluded that based on the evidence, "For biennial screening mammography in women aged 40 to 49 years, there is moderate certainty that the net benefit is small." Walsh calls the task force recommendation "new government guidelines on mammograms." That's also wrong. The task force is an independent panel convened by the government's Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. But their recommendations carry an important disclaimer: "Recommendations made by the USPSTF are independent of the U.S. government. They should not be construed as an official position of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services." In fact, when the task force released its recommendations, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius promptly issued a press release stating, "There is no question that the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Recommendations have caused a great deal of confusion and worry among women and their families across this country. I want to address that confusion head on. The U.S. Preventive Task Force is an outside independent panel of doctors and scientists who make recommendations. They do not set federal policy and they don't determine what services are covered by the federal government. "There has been debate in this country for years about the age at which routine screening mammograms should begin, and how often they should be given. The Task Force has presented some new evidence for consideration, but our policies remain unchanged. Indeed, I would be very surprised if any private insurance company changed its mammography coverage decisions as a result of this action." Health and Human Services guidelines regarding mammograms did not change. Medicaid still covers the full cost of mammograms for women over 40. And Sebelius was correct that it did not affect private insurance companies' policies regarding mammography coverage. "Our providers continue to provide coverage (of breast cancer screenings) when that is a decision reached between the doctor and patient (even when they are under 50)," said Susan Pisano, a spokeswoman for America's Health Insurance Plans. She said she "doesn't have any reason to believe the health bill is going to change" their policy. "Quite the opposite," Pisano said, "we even do outreach to encourage women to do screenings. We will continue to focus on screenings and prevention. That's something we very much believe in." But back to the Senate bill. There are a few other reasons that Walsh's claims about its limits of mammography are misleading. For one, the bill talks about minimum requirements for policies offered on the exchange. "That's the floor in terms of preventive benefits," said Salganicoff, of Kaiser. "Furthermore, there is nothing that stops anyone from covering diagnostic mammograms for women of any age." The Senate bill makes it clear that plans may offer services well beyond the minimum requirements, including mammograms or any other services. "Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit a plan or issuer from providing coverage for services in addition to those recommended by United States Preventive Services Task Force or to deny coverage for services that are not recommended by such Task Force," the bill states. And if all that weren't enough, legislators went out of their way to ensure that mammograms for women aged 40 to 50 would be covered. Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., added an amendment that requires, when it comes to no-cost preventive services offered to women on the exchange, in addition to the services recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, they also must include services "provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration." And those HHS guidelines say you've got to cover mammograms for women over 40. Asked in an interview with National Public Radio whether task-force studies like the breast cancer recommendations would be the basis for restricting coverage on the health care exchange, Sebelius said it is the secretary of health and human services — not the advisory panels — who would be have final say on what must be covered. According to NPR, "Asked whether she would be willing to pledge that as long as she remains secretary of health and human services, she will make sure that every plan offered on the exchange will give coverage for annual mammograms for women over 40, Sebelius responded: 'Well, yes. I think that is an important service. It's a determination that we've made.'" Sen. David Vitter, R-La., offered an amendment (which passed) that made it even clearer. "For the purposes of this Act, and for the purposes of any other provision of law, the current recommendations of the United States Preventive Service Task Force regarding breast cancer screening, mammography, and prevention shall be considered the most current other than those issued in or around November 2009." In other words, ignore the November task force ruling altogether. Phil Kerpen, vice president of policy at Americans for Prosperity (which spent $750,000 on the ad) called that a "temporary fix" and said "if the task force upholds that again in its next recommendations (as expected) that will no longer be operative." How worried is the American Cancer Society that Kerpen's scenario might lead to insurers not covering mammograms for women under 50? Not at all. "We're comfortable with the final language and that women 40 and above will continue to have access to mammograms as appropriate," said Stephen Finan, senior director of policy at the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. The HHS guidelines include mammograms for women over 40, he noted, so "as of now, if everything in the plan today was law, women over 40 would continue to be covered by their insurance." In addition, he noted, 49 states have laws that require mammograms to be covered. The rules vary from state to state, but most require private insurers to pay 100 percent of the cost of mammograms for women over 40. "The fact is, most group plans today provide it anyway as essential, good preventive service," Finan said. The number of plans that don't cover it is very small, he said, and is relegated to "junk plans." One last point: Without any context provided, Walsh's comments leave the impression this issue applies to all Americans. It doesn't. As Kerpen confirmed, she's talking only about people who participate in the health insurance exchange, not people who get their insurance through their employer. The independent Congressional Budget Office estimated that if the health bill passes, four out of five people would continue to get their insurance through their employer. Walsh was covered through her husband's employer, so this whole issue doesn't even apply to her. To review: The task force did not say women shouldn't receive mammograms until age 50. The task force did include experts on cancer screening. It did not factor in cost. The recommendations are not the new government guidelines (in fact, the government guidelines remained the same). In short, this is a bogus issue. If the bill passes, preventive services recommended by the task force would become the bare minimum insurance companies in the exchange would be required to cover. And with regard to mammograms, specifically, they would be covered for women over 40. Americans for Prosperity got the wrong messenger. With a mother who died of cancer, Walsh is practically a poster child for the kind of person who the task force believes ought to get a mammogram before 50. And she gets her insurance through her husband's insurance. Nothing in the health care bill would change how she (or the four out of five Americans like her) would have received care through employer insurance. More importantly, Americans for Prosperity seized on an issue -- free mammograms for women between 40 and 50 -- that was specifically taken care of with not one, but two, Senate amendments.

pomt-08307	"Senator Robert Hurt voted for a bill that’s raised your electric rates seven times."	false	/virginia/statements/2010/oct/30/tom-perriello/tom-perriello-says-robert-hurt-voted-bill-raised-e/	Electricity has become a hair-raising issue in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District race, with Democratic incumbent Tom Perriello blaming Republican challenger and state Senator Robert Hurt for steep increases in Appalachian Power Company rates. In a recent TV ad replete with "zap!" sound effects, lightning bolt graphics, a frightened kitten and photos of wide-eyed people with static-spiked hair gawking at utility bills, Perriello lays out his claim. "How do most Virginia families react to their electric bills? Pure shock," the ad says. "That’s because Senator Robert Hurt voted for a bill that’s raised your electric rates seven times. Rates have gone up over 50 percent. Those increases also caused factories to close and jobs to be lost. For ignoring your pain, Senator Hurt received over $80,000 from the energy interests. After 10 years in office, Hurt is so out of touch, it’s just plain shocking." While the ad offers plenty of fact-check fodder, PolitiFact Virginia chose to focus on the charge that legislation Hurt voted for in 2007 has been responsible for seven electric rate increases. Asked for the source of the claim, Perriello’s camp pointed to seven Appalachian Power Company rate hikes approved by the State Corporation Commission since 2007. That was the year Hurt, then a member of the state’s House of Delegates, voted for Senate Bill 1416 to establish a new form of electric utility regulation. The law essentially re-regulated electricity supply rates after they were unregulated by the state’s legislature in 1999 to introduce competition to the electric supply business. But the competition failed to materialize. In 2007, the legislation was amended to re-regulate electric rates for both supply and distribution service, but it was an alternative form of re-regulation, not a full return to the way the SCC set rates prior to 1999. The provisions built into the new regulatory model are what some opponents, including Perriello, say allow rates to be higher than they might otherwise be if the SCC had been permitted to regulate rates as it had in the past. Now, back to the claim. Yes, it’s true that Appalachian rates have increased seven times since the 2007 legislation was passed. But let’s take a closer look at why the rates have risen. Appalachian Power’s rates remained essentially flat from the early 1980s to 2005, when the company began to add environmental compliance facilities to coal-burning power plants. Between 2005 and the end of this year, the company will have spent $2 billion on environmental compliance, a cost that the company had to pass on to consumers, said company spokesman Todd Burns. Burns said the company also saw an increase in coal prices in late 2008 and an increase in customer electricity usage. "Those were the three things that stacked up to increase electric rates," he said. "The bottom line is that Virginia regulation didn’t raise rates at all," Burns said. "Regardless of which regulatory structure you come under, electric utilities are permitted to cover environmental compliance, costs and fuel." That’s backed up by a ruling from the State Corporation Commission following the steepest of the rate hikes in 2008. TheSCC said "a significant portion of the increase relates to capital expenditures made to generation and distribution facilities needed to provide service to customers." The SCC’s ruling continued "A large portion of this increase is attributable to environmental improvements made to the generation facilities to comply with federal laws and regulations." Periello’s campaign points out that the seven increases were all filed under the new "2007 legislation." But Burns said that the SCC decided on six of the seven rates increases using the old regulations, adding that the new rate-setting system did not take effect until 2009. According to the State Corporation Commission, that’s partly true. Because the 2007 legislation did more than just re-regulate, some amendments to existing law took effect in 2007 and the rate increases were actually decided by the SCC using a combination of the old regulatory model and new pieces. But Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, a Republican, who represents consumers in utility rate cases before the State Corporation Commission, says the increases would have been allowable well before 2007. "Ultimately, the types of costs that APCO has sought to recover in its rate cases (fuel, environmental costs, etc.) would also have been recoverable under the law as it existed not only prior to 2007, but dating back to before the 1999 restructuring law, as well," Cuccinelli wrote in a Sept. 13 commentary piece for the Martinsville Bulletin. Finally, it bears mentioning that when Appalachian’s rates jumped again last December, Hurt was among the legislators to vote for emergency legislation requiring the company to suspend the interim rate charge on customers. So, let’s recap. Yes, Appalachian electric rates have risen seven times since re-regulation legislation was passed with Hurt’s support. And yes, those seven rate increase requests were filed under 2007 legislation. But Perriello is distorting the significance of Hurt’s vote. The reality is that the cases were decided using a combination of the old regulatory system and a few new provisions. The SCC confirms that APCO’s rate increases were substantially the result of outside factors that would have been permissable under the previous legislation. For these reasons, we find the claim to be False.	None	Tom Perriello	None	None	None	2010-10-30T13:00:00	2010-10-12	['Robert_Hurt_(politician)']

He made the argument on his campaign website, where he encouraged people to sign a petition against offshore oil drilling. This is what he wrote: “The recent disaster in the Gulf just underscores the need for a moratorium on any new offshore drilling, but Charlie Crist is busy flip-flopping his stance and Marco Rubio refuses to rule drilling out. Kendrick Meek is the only candidate who has consistently been against expanded drilling.” Meek has largely opposed increased offshore drilling during his congressional tenure. But is he the only candidate consistently opposed to it? We checked with the other major Senate candidates on the issue. Those who have held public office -- Gov. Charlie Crist, former House Speaker Marco Rubio and former Miami Mayor Maurice Ferre -- have publicly declared their positions to various media. Libertarian Alexander Snitker and Jeff Greene, both of whom have never held public office, each stated - for all intents and purposes - their opposition.Here's a more detailed look at each of the candidates: Gov. Charlie Crist: As a candidate for governor in 2006, Crist was unequivocal that he would never support oil drilling off Florida's shores. In 2008, Crist, who was considered a vice presidential running mate with Republican John McCain, backed off his previously staunch opposition. The April 20, 2010, spill convinced him it was risky, and as a result, Crist again became opposed. Clearly, Crist's position on offshore oil drilling has been anything but consistent. Marco Rubio: Rubio has declined to rule out additional offshore drilling. On May 5, 2010, he spoke to reporters in Washington, D.C., about the issue. ‘I've not heard anyone say you cannot safely drill for oil because there are thousands of rigs drilling even as we speak that are not leaking, that are not causing this ecological disaster,'' he said in a story published by the Miami Herald. He later added: ''The question is: 'Should the United States have access to all of its energy resources?' And the answer to me is yes. It has to be done in a way that's safe and clearly not destructive to your environment, to your ecology, or to your economy." Rubio has been consistent, though he does not share Meek's position. Maurice Ferre: The former Miami mayor says he has always been opposed offshore oil drilling. In his position paper, which he shared with PolitiFact Florida, he bluntly wrote that ''the juice from drilling off the Florida coast is not worth the squeeze of putting our larger economy at risk.'' He said he authored the paper with the help of the Everglades Foundation, an opponent of offshore oil drilling. Jeff Greene: Newcomer Greene told the Miami Herald that he has always opposed drilling off Florida's shore. He told the Century Village Democratic Club in West Palm Beach on May 25: ‘‘Why do people come to Florida? The ocean, the coasts, the beaches. This is not a fun extra thing that we have. This is the lifeline of our state. We're not going to have any offshore drilling in Florida. I was against it before, I'm against it now, and I'll be against it forever.’’ Having not held public office, this represents his first public comments on the subject. Alexander Snitker: The Libertarian candidate supports offshore oil drilling, but only under certain conditions. He wants oil companies held responsible for damage and wants the $75 million cap on damages removed, saying it ''creates a ''moral hazard'' for oil companies. Environmental groups who follow Congress on the issue say the four-term lawmaker has remained consistent in his opposition to offshore oil drilling. The League of Conservation Voters, which grades lawmakers on their environmental votes, gives Meek high marks for opposing oil drilling, as does Environment America, which tracks votes on environmental issues. Among the votes they monitored: in 2007 he voted against an amendment that would have lifted a drilling moratorium off the Eastern seaboard from Florida to Delaware starting 3 miles off the shore. Meek also was one of 100 U.S. House members in 2003 to sign a letter urging congressional leaders not to open Florida's coastline to offshore drilling. He signed a similar letter in 2005, and in 2006. He also voted in 2006 against a proposal to allow oil and gas exploration within 50 to 100 miles of most coastlines, and within 234 miles of Tampa Bay. When President Barack Obama issued a call in March for expanded offshore oil drilling, Meek gave it a tepid review. But when looking at Meek's voting record since joining Congress in 2003, we found one taken Sept. 16, 2008, on the Comprehensive American Energy Security and Consumer Act in the U.S. House of Representatives. The bill included a provision that would have allowed oil drilling 50 miles beyond shores. First, let’s put the nation's political climate into context. In the fall of 2008, the presidential campaign between Obama and McCain intensified over oil drilling. Amid soaring gas prices and cries of "Drill, Baby, Drill,'' many politicians, including Obama and McCain, reverse coursed and embraced oil drilling. President George W. Bush also had lifted a presidential moratorium on offshore oil drilling, potentially opening the way for drilling within 3 miles of some coastlines. Hammered by the calls, House Democrats began to move away from their longstanding opposition to drilling, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi unveiling the legislation to open up parts of the U.S. coastline, including Florida, to drilling. On Sept. 16, the House voted 236-189 in favor of the bill. Voting ‘‘yes’’ were 221 Democrats, including Meek, and 15 Republicans. Voting ‘‘no’’ were 13 Democrats and 176 Republicans, according to the roll call vote. Pelosi declared the bill's passage as a ‘‘a new direction in energy policy'' and a "bold step forward." Florida Democrats said at the time that the bill stuck by a 2006 compromise that gives Florida's coastline at least a 125-mile buffer in the Gulf of Mexico. But Republicans lampooned the legislation as a sham, designed to give Democrats the illusion of supporting oil drilling, while actually keeping most oil (which happens to be within 50 miles of shore) off limits. House Republican Leader John Boehner condemned it, calling it “a hoax on the American people.’’ The Bush White House also threatened a veto, stating that "this bill purports to open access to American energy sources while in reality taking actions to stifle development." That threat from Bush doomed passage of the legislation in the Senate, where it was never brought up for a vote on the floor. “The issue you raise is not about (Meek’s) change of heart, it's about responding to the Bush administration's decision on the moratorium, and the (House GOP) proposal. Faced with those circumstances, Democrats acted to limit offshore drilling, because otherwise it would have been open season,’’ said Adam Sharon, Meek’s spokesman. That gets us back to Meek’s original statement that he's "the only candidate who has consistently been against expanded drilling." Meek did vote at least one time to expand drilling -- though the legislation only allowed it in limited cases and under specific conditions that probably would never have happened. And his Senate opponents either don’t share his opposition to offshore oil drilling or have not held public office to warrant a documented account of their stance on the issue. So, given the political posturing over the 2008 vote, we rate Meek’s claim as Mostly True.	None	Kendrick Meek	None	None	None	2010-05-26T18:37:14	2010-05-25	['None']
pomt-04297	Sheldon Whitehouse voted for a "$525-billion tax increase on the middle class."	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2012/nov/01/barry-hinckley/us-senate-candidate-barry-hinckley-says-incumbent-/	Did U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, who characterizes himself as a champion of the middle class, vote for a $525-billion tax increase on that group? That's one assertion in a television ad by Republican challenger Barry Hinckley. After raising an allegation about insider trading, which Whitehouse has strongly denied, the commercial says "Whitehouse voted to raise taxes on middle-class families." The phrase "$525 billion tax increase on the middle class" flashes on the screen. The commercial offers no further information about what Hinckley is talking about, so we asked the Hinckley campaign for its backup. Campaign manager Patrick Sweeney said the ad refers to the Affordable Care Act, the health care plan often known as Obamacare, which Whitehouse supported. PolitiFact has examined similar claims, including one in which Hinckley declared that the law will "add trillions of dollars in debt," a claim we ruled False. The government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the legislation, designed to expand health coverage, will generate $525 billion in revenue. A lower estimate by Congress' nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation predicted it will bring in more than $437.8 billion. Sweeney said the ad is using the CBO estimate. But there are a few significant facts the ad doesn't mention. First, that's not money raised over one year. It's over 10 years, from 2010 through 2019 for legislation that is being gradually phased in. In 2019, annual revenue is expected to have risen to $88.2 billion. Second, most of the money won't be coming from the middle class, as the ad states. For example, a huge chunk of the revenue, $210 billion of the $437.8 billion in the Joint Committee estimate, comes from both a higher Medicare payroll tax to be paid by individuals earning more than $200,000 a year ($250,000 for couples filing jointly) and from a new 3.8 percent tax on investment income if your income is already high. Those take effect in 2013 and are taxes that middle class families will not see. Other taxes aren't geared to the middle class either, although all taxpayers may have to foot the bill indirectly as the extra costs are factored into the goods and services they buy. They include a fee for pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers (which will raise an estimated $27 billion); an excise tax on manufacturers and importers of medical devices ($20 billion); and a fee on health insurance providers ($60.1 billion). In addition, there's the excise tax on indoor tanning services (expected to raise $2.7 billion) and the stricter limit on deducting medical expenses on tax returns, which is expected to raise $15.2 billion. Both will have a more direct effect on the well-tanned or very-ill middle class. One other element of the law that will affect the middle class is the provision of Obamacare known as the individual mandate. It requires people to pay an annual penalty if they don't buy health insurance. It takes effect in 2014, starting off at a minimum of $95 for an individual and rising to $695 per year in 2016. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld that controversial provision by characterizing it as a tax, not a penalty. Is this a tax/penalty on the middle class? The CBO, the source used by the Hinckley campaign, has estimated that by 2016, 55 percent of the money collected via the individual mandate will come from people with incomes in the top 20 percent, which is a family of four making roughly $120,000 or more. So less than half the money will be coming from middle class Americans. How much money is involved? About $4 billion in 2016. The amount coming from the middle class and lower class: roughly $1.8 billion. To put that in perspective, $1.8 billion is 3 percent of the $57 billion or so Obamacare will be raising from everyone in 2016. Our ruling Barry Hinckley said Sheldon Whitehouse voted for a "$525 billion tax increase on the middle class." The ad doesn't say that it's really talking about Obamacare, and that the money is designed to help pay for health coverage for the uninsured, many of whom are in the middle class. It also doesn't point out that the $525 billion is spread out over 10 years, through 2019. Most of it doesn't come from the middle class. And of the $4 billion the government expects to collect each year from people who choose not to purchase health insurance, less than half will come from the middle class. The claim in the Hinckley ad is so ridiculously off base, we rate it Pants on Fire! (Get updates from PolitiFact Rhode Island on Twitter: @politifactri.

pomt-02375	Earth "has not warmed for the last 17 years."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/mar/17/patrick-moore/climate-change-skeptic-patrick-moore-says-earth-ha/	Fox News pundit Sean Hannity set the stage for a screaming match on climate change when he invited liberal Bob Beckel of The Five to debate Patrick Moore, a former Greenpeace activist who says there is no proof man is contributing to a warming planet. Beckel criticized Moore for his work as a spokesman for the nuclear energy industry and for saying carbon emissions go back into trees and food rather than the atmosphere. "Come on, Patrick. You know better than that," Beckel said during the March 11 edition of Hannity. But Moore said cries about climate change are actually just about fits of weather. "Basically, they're just saying weather these days," Moore said. "They're saying the weather is climate change, but that's not true. Weather is just weather, like the cold weather we're getting this year. It has not warmed for the last 17 years. We know that for sure. And that brings into question the whole hypothesis." PunditFact wanted to know if the Earth has not warmed for the last 17 years, and what it means if anything for the theory of climate change. We found clues, and seeming contradictions to his claim, in the PolitiFact archive. Lately it’s been hot a lot President Barack Obama warned the nation there will be consequences from not doing more to combat climate change in his 2013 State of the Union address, pointing out "the 12 hottest years on record have all come in the last 15." PolitiFact rated his statement True. (Actually it’s 13 or 14 of the last 15.) But that doesn’t necessarily rule out Moore’s claim about the earth not getting warmer lately. The statements can co-exist, with some additional context. Moore’s claim is a popular argument of people who say climate change isn’t real. The problem is it is cherry-picked and leaves out the rest of the story about earth’s dramatic temperature increases over the last century. NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies tracks global land-ocean temperatures using a temperature index. (The index shows the temperature anomaly of each year. The temperature anomaly shows how a year's land-ocean temperatures compares with the longterm average. A higher anomaly, such as 0.67 degrees Celsius in 2010, shows how much warmer a year was than the longterm average. A negative anomaly, last seen in 1976, indicates a cooler year than the referenced period.) As you can see, Earth’s land-ocean temperatures escalated starting in the 1970s, setting off a new era of rising sea levels, increased greenhouse gas emissions and melting sea ice. Temperatures spiked about 17 years ago in 1998, an outlier year that involved a strong El Niño with abnormally warm ocean temperatures. Since then, temperatures have remained relatively, but not entirely flat. That’s the basis for Moore’s claim. There are several problems with his analysis, however. Data for 2014 isn’t available yet. So really there are only 16 data points (years) between 1998 and 2014. If you include 1997 to the analysis, Moore is clearly wrong. The years 2005 and 2010 were both warmer than 1998, though only slightly. That also makes Moore’s statement technically inaccurate, though most scientists agree that temperatures have remained relatively flat recently. Moore cherry-picked a year when temperatures spiked. "What was an extraordinary event in 1998 is now the new normal," said Goddard Institute program analyst Reto Ruedy, program manager at NASA’s Goddard Institute. Moore would be incorrect if he chose 1999, 1997, 1996 or any year before that. "If you start with an extremely warm year, the warming trend going forward is going to be mostly flat," said Gordon Hamilton, associate research professor at the Climate Change Institute at the University of Maine. "You could easily choose 1999 and 1996 and you would find that there’s an upward trend," said Kevin Trenberth, a distinguished senior scientist in the climate analysis section at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. "It’s cherry-picking to get the result that he apparently desires." Moore’s response While Moore used the 17-year-statistic on Hannity to make the argument that climate change isn’t happening, he told us the figure "does not prove much." Moore said NOAA and NASA recordkeeping only go back 150 years and the planet’s temperature has fluctuated over the course of time. It is cooler now than for "most of life history," he said. "It is a pause, flat, whatever you want to call it, for 17 years," Moore said. Hamilton and Ruedy dismissed Moore’s qualms, saying the 150-year record is reliable to determine statistically significant trends. For pre-19th century estimates, scientists use other methods, such as tree rings and ice core bubbles, to detect climate trends, Ruedy said. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group operating under the United Nations that reviews climate change research, has concluded the warming of the climate is "unprecedented over decades to millennia." Moore’s Greenpeace ties A final note about Moore. In his interview on Hannity and in many other places, Moore has been described as a "founder" of Greenpeace. The organization, however, disputes that. Greenpeace devotes a webpage to explaining Moore’s lack of credentials, though they agree he was involved in the group’s early days. The group was founded in 1970 as the Don’t Make a Wave Committee with the goal of stopping an American nuclear weapons test on Amchitka Island in the Aleutians. Moore, a college student, wrote a letter to the group in 1971 asking to join the crew of activists sailing to protest the nuclear test. Moore was one of three Greenpeace members on board the Phyllis Cormack, which carried a dozen passengers to Amchitka Island for the protest. Greenpeace says the group’s founders include seven people, but not Moore. Greenpeace leaders voted Moore out of his positions as director of Greenpeace Canada and one of five directors of Greenpeace International, and Moore left in 1986, said Greenpeace spokesman David Pomerantz. He served as a consultant and co-chairman of the nuclear industry-funded Clean and Safe Energy Coalition until he retired from it in 2013. Our ruling Moore said the whole theory of climate change is called into question because "it has not warmed for the last 17 years." It’s true that global surface temperatures have remained relatively flat for 17 years, since 1998. However, both 2005 and 2010 were warmer than 1998. Moore’s statement alone ignores that the first decade of the 21st century was the warmest on record. And Moore is cherry-picking a timeframe to support his argument by starting at an extremely warm year. Global surface temperatures have risen, for instance, if you started at 1999, 1996, or any year before that. Moore’s statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-02097	"Fifty percent of Americans will go hungry at some time in their lives."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2014/may/18/robert-malin/ri-anti-poverty-activist-says-fifty-percent-americ/	Millions of people go hungry in the United States every year, despite this being one of the world’s wealthiest nations. But quantifying the problem is difficult. Robert Malin, an activist with the newly formed Rhode Island Mobilization Against Poverty, offered his view last month: "Fifty percent of Americans will go hungry at some time in their lives," he said during a discussion April 20, 2014, on WJAR-TV’s "10 News Conference." An activist, Malin was with Occupy Providence, which occupied the city’s downtown Burnside Park in 2011 as part of the national grassroots movement. When we asked Malin the basis for his claim, he cited "Transitioning In and Out of Poverty," a 2009 report by the Washington, D.C.-based Urban Institute. Malin directed us to this statement: "Slightly more than half of the U.S. population experiences poverty at some time before the age of 65." That’s very different from what Malin said. Poverty and hunger often correlate. But experts - including the report’s author - underscore that they are not one and the same. The U.S. Department of Agriculture and many nonprofit or non-governmental organizations use the term "food insecurity," that is, "people who lack consistent access to adequate food and are unable at times during the year to acquire adequate food because they lack sufficient money or resources." Plainly stated: they have difficulty putting food on the table. The USDA defines hunger as a physiological condition "that might result from food insecurity." A government panel has recommended a national assessment of hunger. Caroline Ratcliffe, co-author of the Urban Institute Report that Malin cites, said, "The 50 percent number that he quotes echoes findings in the poverty literature that half of the population will be poor before 65." "The percentage of Americans who experience poverty and economic hardship is very high. What we also know, but isn’t exactly the number he cites, is that people who are poor - a lot of them are food insecure," Ratcliffe said. The numbers "move together, but they are not the same thing," Ratcliffe said. We also interviewed Alisha J. Coleman-Jensen, PhD, a sociologist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service and author of numerous articles and reports on household food insecurity. That includes "Household Food Security in the United States in 2012." In 2012, "by our estimate, 14.5 percent of households were food insecure," she said. That translates to roughly 49 million people in 17.6 million households. Of those, "5.7 percent of households are at a high risk for food insecurity, meaning they are not getting enough to eat, have disrupted eating patterns or go whole days without food.Those numbers are "not anywhere near 50 percent." As for Malin’s claim, "I don’t know where that’s from ... I haven’t seen that figure anywhere." Coleman-Jensen wondered aloud if Malin had misinterpreted the close to 50 million people living in food-insecure households as 50 percent. "If they’re talking about somebody going hungry at any point in their lives … we do not have data that would allow us to measure the percent of people who will experience food insecurity or low food security ‘at some point in their lives.’’’ She noted that "our data [are] for a single year." Mark R. Rank, a professor of social welfare at Washington University, in St. Louis, has conducted research that found that half of all American children will at some point be in a household that uses food stamps. But he said he knew of no studies that addressed lifetime risk of hunger. "One could argue that if you’re using food stamps you’re at risk of experiencing hunger, but that would be as far as one could go," Rank said. Kathleen Gorman, director of the University of Rhode Island’s Feinstein Center for a Hunger-Free America, says she does not find Malin’s statement unreasonable, "but it is extremely difficult to prove." "First of all, we do not have any good measures of ‘hunger’ -- it is a pretty amorphous idea. When we measure hunger, we typically use the USDA Household Food Security survey -- and while they are not identical, most people accept that one is an indicator of the other," she said. Our ruling Anti-poverty activist Robert Malin said half of all Americans will go hungry at some point in their lives. Experts we talked with knew of no research that supported Malin’s claim. And studies show the percentage of Americans facing "food insecurity" annually is closer to 15 percent. Some studies, however, have found that half of all Americans will be poor at some point in their lives. And researchers say hunger and poverty are linked. Because the statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-07155	"Taxpayers pay for roughly 45 percent of all births in Wisconsin! And 60 percent of the births in Milwaukee!!!"	true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jun/14/michelle-litjens/wisconsin-gop-rep-michelle-litjens-says-taxpayers-/	Some of the biggest bashers of government entitlement programs are tea party folks, many of whom are newly elected officials. Among them is Wisconsin state Rep. Michelle Litjens, R-Oshkosh. While campaigning ahead of the November 2010 elections, she organized the tea party rally where another Oshkosh Republican, Ron Johnson, gave his first political speech. Johnson went on to defeat Democrat Russ Feingold for the U.S. Senate. Like Johnson, during her campaign, Litjens railed against government spending and taxes as being too high. And on June 2, 2011, Litjens, a 38-year-old married mother of two, let loose on the Internet with this anti-entitlement tweet: "Unreal! Taxpayers pay for roughly 45 percent of all births in Wisconsin! And 60 percent of the births in Milwaukee!!! No wonder we’re broke." A misinformed right-wing rant? Or evidence of the pervasiveness of public assistance, which many conservatives blame for high taxes and government deficits? We wanted to know. We’ll go to the Truth-O-Meter only for the statistical claims in Litjens' statement. But to add perspective, we’ll also address her "we’re broke" comment. When we asked Litjens’ legislative aide for evidence to back her statement, he provided Wisconsin birth statistics from the state Department of Health Services for 2008. We confirmed that they are the most recent available in terms of taxpayer funding. The figures show that 71,977 babies were born in Wisconsin in 2008 -- and that Medicaid, the state-federal program that pays medical bills for low-income individuals and families, paid for the care provided in 32,792 of the births. That’s 45.6 percent, which confirms Litjens’ first claim. The 45.6 percent figure -- it was 44 percent in ‘07, 43 percent in ‘06 and 42 percent in ‘05 -- put Wisconsin on the higher end of Medicaid-financed births nationally in 2008. That’s according to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan group that studies health care policy. The rate ranged from 8 percent in New Jersey to 70 percent in Louisiana, although figures were not available for 15 states. As for Litjens’ second claim, that taxpayers paid for 60 percent of the births in Milwaukee, she didn’t specify whether she meant Milwaukee County or the City of Milwaukee. But either way, her claim is accurate. State figures show there were 15,353 births in the county in 2008, and that Medicaid paid for the care of 9,170 of them, or 59.7 percent. In the city, Medicaid paid for 72.5 percent of the 11,311 births. Here’s a little more on the state statistics for 2008 births: Over 85 percent of the 130 births in Menominee County were paid for by Medicaid, the highest percentage in Wisconsin. In Ozaukee County, Medicaid paid for 19 percent of the 822 births, the lowest rate. In Litjens’ home county, Winnebago, Medicaid paid for nearly 39 percent of the 1,955 births. Medicaid, by the way, pays for more than just labor and delivery. It also finances prenatal visits and postpartum care. We asked Jon Peacock, research director of the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families, a Madison-based advocacy organization, about Litjens’ statement. He didn’t disagree with the statistics, but took issue with her suggestion that Medicaid-financed births are one reason "we’re broke." Peacock said prenatal care provided through Medicaid saves tax dollars by reducing the number of low-birth-weight babies. He cited a November 2010 state health department report about births in five Wisconsin counties in 2005. The average Medicaid hospital charges for a low-birth-weigh baby during the first year of life was $164,257, compared with $3,514 for a normal-birth-weight birth. Peacock also said that the elderly and people with disabilities account for at least 70 percent of Medicaid expenditures, far more than babies. But critics of entitlement programs can also cite statistics about the size of the government safety net. An October 2010 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story, which reported that Medicaid paid for 45 percent of all baby deliveries in Wisconsin in 2008, also reported that at that time: More than 1.1 million people in Wisconsin depended on Medicaid health programs. Medicaid provided health care for one in five Wisconsin residents. Medicaid health programs had expanded faster in Wisconsin over the previous nine years than in any state except Arizona. But let’s return to what brought us here. GOP state Rep. Michelle Litjens claimed that taxpayers paid for roughly 45 percent of all births in Wisconsin, including 60 percent of the births in Milwaukee. Her staff said she was referring to state figures for 2008, which we confirmed are the most recent available in terms of how many of the births were financed by Medicaid. State statistics confirm both of Litjens’ claims. We rate her statement True.	None	Michelle Litjens	None	None	None	2011-06-14T09:00:00	2011-06-02	['Wisconsin', 'Milwaukee']
pomt-03961	Says he "has repeatedly praised Chuck Hagel’s character, patriotism, bravery, and personal service defending our nation."	half-true	/texas/statements/2013/feb/15/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-said-he-has-repeatedly-praised-chuck-hage/	U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, who has drawn fire from Democrats for his questions of Chuck Hagel, maintains that critics overlook his positive references to Hagel, the former two-term Nebraska senator nominated for secretary of Defense. At Hagel’s confirmation hearings, Cruz employed video clips of Hagel being interviewed by Al-Jazeera to suggest the nominee espoused views hostile to Israel, Politico summarized Feb. 14, 2013, and during a committee vote, Cruz criticized Hagel’s failure to reveal details of his personal compensation from 2008 to 2010, asking whether North Korean sources may have funneled $200,000 to the defense nominee. The senator’s questions are not attacks, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier later said, according to a Feb. 14, 2013, post on the Dallas Morning News’ Trailblazers blog. Frazier continued: "Sen. Cruz has repeatedly praised Chuck Hagel’s character, patriotism, bravery, and personal service defending our nation — at the confirmation hearing, in writing, and at the committee hearing casting his vote on Senator Hagel’s nomination." He has? President Barack Obama announced his nomination of Hagel, a Vietnam War veteran and former newscaster who served as a Republican senator through early 2009, on Jan. 7, 2013. The Morning News report opened by saying that Cruz, a freshman Republican, was being likened by critics to Joe McCarthy, the late Wisconsin senator whose crusade against communists in government devolved into doubts about his legitimacy. On Feb. 12, 2013, as the Senate Armed Services Committee approved Hagel’s nomination on a 14-11 party line vote, the News said, Cruz suggested that Hagel had taken money under the table from adversaries. "We do not know, for example, if he received compensation for giving paid speeches at extreme or radical groups," Cruz said before the committee vote. "It is at a minimum relevant to know if that $200,000 that he deposited in his bank account came directly from Saudi Arabia, came directly from North Korea." Cruz demanded financial disclosures from Hagel covering five years, three more than required, the News reported, and the Texan said that without that, the "only reasonable inference" is that "there was something in there that they did not want to make public." At the hearing, Politico reported, Sens. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., and John McCain, R-Ariz., rebuked Cruz for "what they considered an unfair line of questioning allegedly impugning Hagel’s patriotism." Nelson chastised Cruz for violating standards of "comity and civility that this committee has always been known for….To question in essence whether somebody is a fellow traveler with another country, I think is taking it too far….You basically have impugned the patriotism of the nominee." Subsequently, the News said, left-leaning pundits compared Cruz’s statement to those aired during the 1950s Red Scare – intimidation by insinuation. Armed Services Chairman Carl Levin, D-Mich., referred to Cruz’s assertions as "innuendo" that lacked factual basis. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., made an allusion to McCarthy, recalling a time when senators would make insinuations by claiming to have a speech someone once made in his pocket, casting aspersions without producing evidence. "It was reminiscent of some bad times," she said, according to the News. By email, Frazier told us that Cruz’s praise of Hagel shows up in video of the committee proceedings, committee transcripts and published articles by Cruz. Cruz’s Jan. 7, 2013, USA Today opinion column opens by calling Hagel a "war hero and public official who has served America honorably. However," it continues, "his views on foreign and defense policy are out of the mainstream, and he is not a good fit for secretary of Defense." The remaining 280 words give reasons not to back Hagel. A Cruz opinion column posted by Politico on Feb. 1, 2013, opens: "Chuck Hagel is a decorated Vietnam veteran with an honorable history fighting for his country, and I commend his personal valor and sacrifice." The rest of the 800-word article covers Cruz concerns about the nominee. Cruz praised Hagel in two moments during meetings of the Armed Services committee. On Jan. 31, 2013, according to a hearing transcript, Cruz prefaced his questioning of Hagel by saying: "I want to begin by thanking you for your honorable service to our nation, for your personal sacrifice that you have put in to standing and fighting for this country." And on Feb. 12, Cruz prefaced his echo of a newspaper saying Hagel’s foreign policy views put him on the Senate’s fringe by saying: "And Sen. Hagel, although I very much respect his personal heroism and character and service, putting his life on the line defending this nation," according to a transcript. Cruz separately issued press releases questioning Hagel’s nomination on Jan. 7 and Feb. 14, 2013. The combined 324 words include no praise. Our ruling Cruz’s office says he has "repeatedly praised" Hagel’s "character, patriotism, bravery, and personal service defending our nation." We found four instances, but in each one--and in others where he aired no praise--Cruz hammered what he calls Hagel’s shortcomings so much so that some colleagues cried foul. The missing context of this claim is that every time, Cruz's praise has been overshadowed by pointed questions and/or critiques. Mark this statement Half True.

pomt-08228	Said they reached a "power-sharing agreement" with Republican Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2010/nov/17/republican-state-senators/georgia-senate-leaders-claim-power-sharing-lieuten/	There was a time when the future looked very bright for Republican Casey Cagle, Georgia's lieutenant governor. He was young and riding the rising tide of a Republican takeover of what had once been a state dominated by Democrats. The governor's office seemed well within his reach. All he had to do was put a couple of terms as the state Senate's leader behind him, line up the campaign donors and then start measuring the curtains in the chief executive's suite. But these days, the doe-eyed Cagle looks more like a deer in the headlights, thanks to a rebellious group of his fellow Republican senators who have staged a lightning-quick palace coup, striking hard and fast at the man who was to have been their leader. The Nov. 2 election returns had barely been counted when the Republican caucus met in Macon in a closed-door session at Mercer University. With a voice vote, Republicans removed Cagle’s power to appoint Senate committee chairmen, which is the key to real influence in the upper chamber. They also stripped Cagle of the ability to decide the makeup of Senate committees. The lieutenant governor will be allowed to direct legislation to particular committees, but he can do that only under the supervision of the Senate membership. Cagle does still preside over the Senate, and he has the bully pulpit of the upper chamber at his disposal. And he can -- apparently -- still appoint senators to important conference committees to iron out House-Senate differences in legislation. However, that power also could come under attack when senators meet next month in Athens in a pre-session gathering. One newspaper columnist noted after the Nov. 5 Macon meeting that Cagle had been relegated to little more than a hall monitor. GOP leaders, however, painted a different picture. "This is simply a new power-sharing agreement that we’ve come to," Senate Majority Leader Chip Rogers, R-Woodstock, told reporters. That sentiment was echoed by other GOP leaders. PolitiFact Georgia wondered who's correct. Does Cagle retain important Senate powers? Or has he been reduced to figurehead? First, a little background about all the intraparty back-stabbing. During the last legislative session, Cagle inserted his Senate allies into the middle of a Republican brawl over Gov. Sonny Perdue's proposal to levy a tax on hospitals and other health facilities. Cagle backed the idea, but some key committee chairmen in the Senate vigorously opposed it. They claimed Cagle never consulted them before pledging their support. Cagle retaliated, stripping the chairmanships of Sens. Judson Hill, R-Marietta, and Preston Smith, R-Rome, two of four Republicans who voted against Perdue's proposal. Sen. Mitch Seabaugh, of Sharpsburg, resigned his position as party whip. That set the stage for a very uncivil war if Cagle won re-election. Which he did, easily, against Democrat Carol Porter. Ironically, Cagle campaigned against Porter by warning Georgia voters that Senate Republicans would immediately strip her of her Senate powers if she won. Emory University political scientist Merle Black said Cagle now finds himself in the same situation faced by former Democratic Lt. Gov. Mark Taylor, who was stripped of his power by the new GOP majority in 2003. "They've turned him into a nominal lieutenant governor -- lieutenant governor in name only," Black said. "I think they've really limited his career opportunities." Kerwin Swint, a political science professor at Kennesaw State University, said the GOP Senate leaders have essentially "marginalized" the lieutenant governor. "There is no doubt his power has been diminished by this," Swint said. "He's not powerless, but his power has certainly been diminished." Cagle spokesman Ben Fry had this to say about all the shenanigans: "While some may be playing political games, the lieutenant governor remains committed to delivering results, which is exactly what the voters just overwhelmingly elected him to do. He is not going to let procedural hurdles get in the way of his passion for creating jobs and making the difficult decisions necessary to balance the budget and move our state forward." But the facts are clear. Power in the Senate has shifted, and shifted dramatically. The real clout in the Senate now will be wielded by an eight-member committee. That body is composed of President Pro Tem Tommie Williams, five GOP caucus officers and two Senate appointees by Cagle. Cagle was expressly prohibited from membership on the committee. This is "power sharing" all right. In the aftermath of the Macon coup, the GOP Senate leadership now has all the power. And it doesn't plan to share it with Cagle. We find the GOP claim about power sharing with the lieutenant governor not only not accurate. It's ridiculous. Pants on Fire.

pomt-01815	The number of jobs created and people lifted out of poverty during Bill Clinton’s presidency was "a hundred times" what it was under President Ronald Reagan.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/21/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-economic-stats-were-100-times/	With the nation mired in a long, slow recovery from the Great Recession, the past tends to have a rosy glow. Republicans like to tout the halcyon days of President Ronald Reagan, while Democrats fondly remember the era of President Bill Clinton. During a recent interview on the Charlie Rose show on PBS, Hillary Clinton -- who had a front-row seat for the Bill Clinton era as first lady -- made clear her economic role model as she continues to weigh a 2016 presidential run. "If I just were to compare Reagan’s eight years with Bill’s eight years, it’s like night and day in terms of the effects," Clinton said during the July 17, 2014, interview. "The number of jobs that were created, the number of people lifted out of poverty, a hundred times more when Bill was president. And did policies have something to do with that? I would argue that they did." Really? Were the Clinton years, statistically, 100 times better than the Reagan years? A reader suggested we check out this claim, so we did. The comparison is actually pretty fair. Both presidents entered office during a weak economic time and exited before the economy went into a downturn. We’ll analyze employment first, and then poverty. We looked at two different date ranges, each of which could plausibly be defined as the duration of their presidency. One was 1980 through 1988 for Reagan and 1992 to 2000 for Clinton. The other was 1981 through 1989 for Reagan and 1993 through 2001 for Clinton. For simplicity, we’ll only write below about one option -- the latter one. The patterns are broadly similar regardless of what range of years you use. Job creation For job creation, we looked at the two most common yardsticks for employment tracked by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics -- total nonfarm employment, and the unemployment rate. For consistency, we used January’s monthly figures for each year. During the eight years under Reagan, the number of employed people went up by 16.1 million, or an increase of 18 percent over the eight-year period. During the eight years under Clinton, the number of employed people went up by 22.9 million, or an increase of 21 percent over the eight-year period. So while both presidents did well, the number of employed people rose faster under Clinton, both in raw numbers and by percentage. What about the unemployment rate? Under Reagan, it fell from 7.5 percent to 5.4 percent -- a drop of 2.1 percentage points. Under Clinton, it fell from 7.3 percent to 4.2 percent -- a drop of 3.1 percentage points. So here, too, both presidents chalked up good marks over eight years, but Clinton’s record on job creation over Reagan was modestly superior. Poverty For poverty, we looked at figures from the U.S. Census Bureau, which has tracked poverty figures for decades. We looked at both raw numbers of people in poverty and the poverty rate. During the eight years under Reagan, the number of Americans in poverty declined by 294,000, or a drop in raw numbers of about 1 percent. During the eight years under Clinton, the number of Americans in poverty declined by 6.5 million, or a drop in raw numbers of about 17 percent. So both presidents oversaw a decline in the raw numbers of people in poverty, but the decline was bigger under Clinton. Next, we looked at the poverty rate -- the percent of all Americans who are impoverished. During the eight years under Reagan, the poverty rate fell from 14 percent to 12.8 percent, or a decline of 1.2 percentage points. During the eight years under Clinton, the poverty rate fell from 15.1 percent to 11.7 percent, or a decline of 3.4 percentage points. So, once again, the poverty rate declined under both presidents, but the decline was bigger under Clinton. Was the improvement ‘a hundred times’ better under Clinton? Put it all together and it’s a vast exaggeration to say Clinton’s record is 100 times better than Reagan’s. Even allowing for some over-enthusiasm on Clinton’s part, the differences are fairly modest. The biggest gap comes from the percentage decrease in impoverished Americans. The decline in raw numbers under Clinton was 17 times greater than under Reagan. But the other metrics are closer. The poverty rate fell close to three times faster under Clinton; the unemployment rate fell 50 percent faster under Clinton; and the number of employed Americans rose 17 percent faster under Clinton. We did not hear back from Clinton’s camp. However, we would be skeptical of the argument that her claim was simply a harmless exaggeration for rhetorical effect. She posits a massive difference in economic improvement under Clinton as opposed to Reagan. In reality, both saw notable improvements, even though Clinton’s were stronger across the board. We also reviewed the video of the interview and didn’t detect any obvious sign that Clinton said it facetiously. Our ruling Clinton said the number of jobs created and people lifted out of poverty during Bill Clinton’s presidency was "a hundred times" what it was under President Ronald Reagan. Clinton’s record does outpace Reagan’s on the four statistical measures we looked at. But the differences are not like night and day, as her phrasing claims. Both presidents saw improvements, with Clinton’s being incrementally better -- not 100 times better. We rate the claim False.

pomt-09963	The federal Hate Crimes Prevention Act bill would create "special protection for pedophiles."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/14/steve-king/rep-steve-king-claims-federal-hate-crime-law-would/	With the federal Hate Crimes Prevention Act moving swiftly through Congress, and President Barack Obama committed to sign it, opponents have ratcheted up their rhetoric and complained about a provision that would add "sexual orientation" and "gender identity" to the list of hate crime categories. In a Fox News interview on May 6, 2009, Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, said the "sexual orientation" wording would provide "special protection to pedophiles." "The definition for sexual orientation was defined by one of the principal authors, Tammy Baldwin of Madison, Wisconsin, as being either heterosexual or homosexual. Well, so within that definition, though, of sexual orientation by the American Psychological Association you've got a whole list of proclivities — they call them paraphilias — and in that list, among them are pedophiles. "And so I don't want special protective status for a pedophile when a regular person would get less — lesser protection under this law. ... This sets up sacred cows in this legislation. So some people are protected more than others in this society." King was so concerned about that possibility that he sought to amend the bill to specifically exclude pedophiles. On the House floor on April 29, 2009, King argued that the lack of a definition of "sexual orientation" in the law would open the door to special protections for people with all kinds of deviant sexual proclivities. "My amendment does not specifically define sexual orientation, although I've tried to do that," King said. "But what it does do is say it doesn't include pedophiles because I think the intent of this committee is clearly that we don't want to provide a, let's just say, a sexual — a special protected status for pedophiles. There are others that I would put in that list as well, but this is the one that stands out to me that should be beyond question that this committee should be able to take a look at this amendment and conclude that whatever we might think about proclivities, pedophiles is not one that should be included." Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, went one step further, suggesting that victims of sex crimes could be guilty of a hate crime if they tried to defend themselves or retaliate against an attacker. "If a mother hears that their child has been raped and she slaps the assailant with her purse, she is now gone after as a hate criminal because this is a protected class. There are other protected classes in here. I mean, simple exhibitionism — I have female friends who have told me over the years that some guy flashed them and their immediate reaction was to hit them with the purse. Well, now, he's committed a misdemeanor. She has committed a federal hate crime because the exhibitionism is protected under sexual orientation," Gohmert said. "The plain meaning of sexual orientation is anything to which someone is sexually oriented. That could include exhibitionism. It can include necrophilia. It could include ... voyeurism. You see somebody spying on you changing clothes and you hit them, they've committed a misdemeanor. You've committed a federal felony under this bill." Their arguments gained a wider audience through postings on the conservative Web site RightMarch.com, which were e-mailed to subscribers of the conservative publication Human Events . The King amendment failed. Opponents said it was unnecessary, that pedophilia was not covered under the definition of sexual orientation. And the Hate Crime Prevention Act passed the House 249-175. A similar bill is pending in the Senate. Many legal scholars we spoke with said King and Gohmert were wrong that pedophiles and other sexual deviants would get special protections from the bill. And supporters of the bill were more blunt, saying the arguments were ridiculous scare tactics. The opponents' arguments display a fundamental misunderstanding of the words "sexual orientation," said Arthur Leonard, a professor of law at New York Law School and an expert in gay rights and discrimination based on sexual orientation. "Pedophilia and sexual orientation are two different things," Leonard said. Sexual orientation, he said, relates to the gender to which a person is romantically attracted while pedophilia relates to age, adults who are sexually fixated on children. Leonard believes it is an attempt by legislators to appeal to their constituents' "yahoo mentality." James Jacobs, an adjunct professor of law at New York University Law School, has been an outspoken critic of hate crime laws. He thinks they are unnecessary, amount to "recriminalizing activities that are already criminal" and are the product of political grandstanding. But even he doesn't buy King's arguments about pedophilia. "I don't think pedophilia would count as sexual orientation," Jacobs said. "It's not a very persuasive argument." We went to Black's Law Dictionary , which defines sexual orientation this way: "A person's predisposition or inclination toward a particular type of sexual activity or behavior; heterosexuality, homosexuality or bisexuality." That first part seems to lend some weight to King's argument. But that ignores the working definition used by the federal government for years, said Michael Lieberman, Washington counsel for the Anti-Defamation League, which has fought for the federal legislation for years. The FBI's Hate Crime Data Collection Guidelines, prepared in response to the 1990 Hate Crime Statistics Act, defines "sexual orientation bias" as "a preformed negative opinion or attitude toward a group of persons based on their sexual attraction toward, and responsiveness to, members of their own sex or members of the opposite sex, e.g., gays, lesbians, heterosexuals." Furthermore, Lieberman said, it ignores decades of history with state hate crime laws. There are currently 31 states that have hate crime laws that include sexual orientation. "There are no cases, zero, at the federal or state level that even remotely resemble what Rep. King and other opponents have talked about," Lieberman said. "It's make-believe." "It's laughable," said Jack Levin, professor of sociology and criminology at Northeastern University and co-chair of the Center on Violence and Conflict. "Why should it happen at the federal level when it hasn't happened at the state level. They are setting up a straw man. ... It's a convenient way of arousing public fear about something that is quite benign." Said Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino: "The assertion that the law is designed in an effort to protect pedophiles is not only without merit, it is an affront to anyone who has been a victim of a hate crime. I think it's a bigoted a scare tactic designed to further denigrate gay and lesbian Americans. I'm disgusted that this has become a part of the debate." So we've found nothing to support the opponents' claims that pedophiles would be protected by the hate crimes bill. The experience of 31 states that have similar laws, the FBI's definition of sexual orientation and the opinions of legal experts have persuaded us not only that the opponents are wrong, but that their arguments are preposterous. We find King's claim to be Pants on Fire.	None	Steve King	None	None	None	2009-05-14T17:43:42	2009-05-06	['None']
pomt-06215	Says Mitt Romney belittled middle-class tax cuts "as nothing more than 'little Band-Aids.' "	mostly false	/florida/statements/2011/dec/07/florida-democratic-party/florida-democrats-say-mitt-romney-called-middle-cl/	As the president pressured Congress to extend his payroll tax cut, Florida Democrats issued a statement calling Republican opposition "shameful." "With Republicans like Mitt Romney belittling middle-class tax cuts as nothing more than 'little Band-Aids,' the Republican Party is sending a clear signal to the American people: they are willing to raise taxes on middle-class Americans just to pay for more tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires and big oil," says a quote from Florida Democratic Party executive director Scott Arceneaux. The phrase "little Band-Aids" caught our eye. Did Mitt Romney really use that phrase to describe tax cuts for the middle-class? We asked Florida Democratic Party spokeswoman Brannon Jordan, who issued the Dec. 1, 2011, release, contacted the Romney campaign and searched for the phrase ourselves. What emerged wasn't quite what Democrats had claimed. What Romney said Romney did use the phrase "little Band-Aids" in an Oct. 11 presidential debate, in his answer to a question about Obama's effort to extend his payroll tax cut. Here's how the exchange with Bloomberg TV White House correspondent Juliana Goldman unfolded: GOLDMAN: "Gov. Romney, I want to ask you, because President Obama's jobs bill stalled in the Senate today, and so it may have to be broken into component parts for Congress to vote on. "If the payroll tax cut is not extended, that would mean a tax increase for all Americans. What would be the consequences of that?" ROMNEY: "No one likes to see tax increases, but look, the stimulus bills the president comes out with that are supposedly going to create jobs, we have now seen this played in the theater several times, and what we're seeing has not worked. "The American people know that when he went into office and borrowed $800 billion for a massive job stimulus program, then they did not see the jobs. Some of those green jobs we were supposed to get, that is money down the drain. "The right course for America is not to keep spending money on stimulus bills, but instead to make permanent changes to the tax code. Look, when you give -- as the president's bill does, if you give a temporary change to the payroll tax, and you say, we're going to extend this for a year or two, employers do not hire people for a year or two. "They make an investment in a person that goes over a long period of time. And so if you want to get the economy going again, you have to have people who understand how employers think, what it takes to create jobs. "And what it takes to create jobs is more than just a temporary shift in a tax stimulus, it needs instead fundamental restructuring of our economy to make that sure we are the most attractive place in the world for investment, for innovation, for growth, and for hiring. And we can do that again." GOLDMAN: "So you would be okay with seeing the payroll tax cuts?" ROMNEY: "Look, I don't like temporary little Band-Aids, I want to fundamentally restructure America's foundation economically." Democrats seized on the conversation as evidence that Romney opposed extending payroll tax cuts, which the Obama administration says save a typical family $1,000 a year. Within days, the Democratic National Committee rolled out "Operation Band-Aids," including a Web video, conference calls and events. "By opposing the extension of middle-class tax cuts, (Romney) is supporting a tax increase on middle-income families and small businesses," POLITICO quoted DNC communications director Brad Woodhouse as saying. Romney's tax plan Of course, a closer reading of the debate shows Romney opposed the tax cuts, not on their merits or because of whom they would benefit but rather as temporary cuts rather than long-term changes. The right course, he said, was "to make permanent changes to the tax code." He criticized "a temporary change to the payroll tax," calling it "a temporary shift in a tax stimulus" before he concluded he didn't like "temporary little Band-Aids." His opposition to temporary tax code fixes wasn't a new point. Page 39 of his economic plan, released in early September, says, "President Obama’s proclivity for fostering uncertainty about the long-term shape of the tax code is particularly troublesome. He has embraced one temporary solution after the next while rejecting permanent adjustments that would bring some predictability and stability to investment decision-making." That's the essence of his Oct. 11 debate answer. And it's scarcely a blanket opposition to "middle-class tax cuts," as Democrats characterized it. In fact, he had previously exempted the payroll tax cut extension from his criticism. On Page 47, he mentioned some short-term measures he would support — and a "lower payroll tax" is among them. "Notwithstanding President Obama’s counterproductive meddling in the tax code, there are some short-term measures that — far from increasing uncertainty and discouraging job creators — can serve as powerful incentives for investment and hiring. These short-term measures are very much the subject of current discussion and debate in Washington. Some of them may even be proposed by President Obama in the coming days. "A robust investment tax credit, extending the write-off for capital expenditures for an additional year, and a lower payroll tax could each have a positive effect if properly structured. But such measures are no substitute for the longer-term structural reforms to our tax system that are required to place the economy on sound footing for a recovery." So the Democrats were right to seize on Romney's debate answer in one sense: It differed from his on-the-record support for "a lower payroll tax" as distinct from other "counterproductive" short-term measures. In the debate, he instead grouped Obama's proposed tax cut extension into his criticism of short-term fixes. That departure didn't last long. Days after Florida Democrats' news release, Romney returned to the talking points of his published economic plan in an appearance on Michael Medved's conservative radio talk show: "I would like to see the payroll tax cut extended just because I know that working families are really feeling the pinch right now — middle-class Americans are having a hard time," he said on the Dec. 5 show, as reported by the New York Times and others. Meanwhile, the details of his economic plan, while too vague for a complete analysis, appear to support lower taxes for the middle class, according to Bob Williams of the Tax Policy Center. The center maintains a summary of Republican candidates' tax proposals. "He wants lower rates in the future for taxes," Williams said. "... I would say it's not fair to say he doesn't care about the little guys." Romney would maintain President George W. Bush's tax cuts, which include cuts for the middle class (though also, of course, for the rich). He wants to reduce to zero investment taxes for low- and middle-income families to boost their retirement savings — something he doesn't offer to do for those with adjusted gross incomes over $200,000. In the long-term, he wants to broaden the tax base and reduce and flatten tax rates, which would likely favor the wealthy more than anyone else, Williams said, but he would keep exemptions, deductions, credits, and other tax preferences in the short-term, many of which benefit lower- and middle-income taxpayers. He wants lower rates across the board. And, as we said, his published plan says he supports a temporary reduction in the payroll tax "if properly structured." Our ruling Florida Democrats used Romney as an example of a Republican "willing to raise taxes on middle-class Americans just to pay for more tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires." They accused him of "belittling middle-class tax cuts as nothing more than 'little Band-Aids.'" But the context of his Oct. 11 debate performance shows he decries not "middle-class tax cuts," but "a temporary change to the payroll tax" as part of a stimulus bill. He argued, essentially, for permanently lower tax rates, including for the middle class. Meanwhile, the debate performance stands as an exception to Romney's published support for lowering payroll taxes. Democrats get some credit for accurately pointing out that in the debate, Romney didn't support Obama's effort to extend his payroll tax cut. He did indeed call temporary tax changes "little Band-Aids." But they ignore critical context from the debate and Romney's published tax proposals when they declare he belittled "middle-class tax cuts," creating the impression he opposes middle class-tax breaks.

pomt-10384	Obama "wants a windfall profits tax on oil to go along with the new taxes he also plans for coal and natural gas."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/18/john-mccain/yes-obama-wants-to-tax-windfall-profits/	As the candidates jockey over energy policies and offshore drilling, Sen. John McCain has been criticizing Sen. Barack Obama for wanting to raise taxes. "He wants a windfall profits tax on oil, to go along with the new taxes he also plans for coal and natural gas," McCain said in a June 18, 2008, speech in Houston. "If the plan sounds familiar, it's because that was President Jimmy Carter's big idea too — and a lot of good it did us." Indeed, McCain is right that Obama supports a windfall profits tax, which would be levied on oil companies to capture some of their profits from rising prices. "I'll make oil companies like Exxon pay a tax on their windfall profits, and we'll use the money to help families pay for their skyrocketing energy costs and other bills," Obama said in a speech June 9. A windfall tax — actually an excise tax imposed on the difference between the market price of oil and an adjusted base price — was enacted in 1980 but repealed in 1988. By then, oil prices had dropped, it was generating little or no revenue and there were concerns that it made the United States more dependent on foreign oil. Many Democrats want to bring it back to discourage oil companies from raising prices. We couldn't find many details about Obama's windfall-profits proposal except that he would use it for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which helps the poor pay their heating and cooling bills. As for the other part of McCain's claim, that Obama wants new taxes for coal and natural gas, the details are more sketchy. The McCain campaign cites a February 2008 interview of Obama with San Antonio Express-News columnist Carlos Guerra. In that interview, Obama first answered a question about funding sources for education. Guerra then asked, "Have you considered other funding sources, say taxing emerging energy forms, for example, say a penny per kilowatt hour on wind energy?" Obama replied: "Well, that's clean energy, and we want to drive down the cost of that, not raise it. We need to give them subsidies so they can start developing that. What we ought to tax is dirty energy, like coal and, to a lesser extent, natural gas. But I think that the real way to fund education is for local communities to step up and say this is important to us. There are no shortcuts." We couldn't find any other references to new taxes on coal or natural gas on the Obama's campaign Web site, although we found several items where Obama wants incentives for clean coal. Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for the campaign, said Obama was referring to his proposal for a cap-and-trade system for global warming. Still, it's clear from the context that the coal and natural gas comment was more an aside than an announcement of a major new tax proposal. But regardless, Obama said what he said: "What we ought to tax is dirty energy, like coal and, to a lesser extent, natural gas." He may not have a detailed position paper on it, but it seems to be an overall statement of his beliefs and the Obama campaign did not dispute that he said it. So we find McCain's claim to be Mostly True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-06-18T00:00:00	2008-06-17	['None']
pomt-11128	"Americans received the biggest tax cut in history last year."	false	/north-carolina/statements/2018/jun/04/patrick-mchenry/nc-republican-repeats-false-tax-claim/	With midterm elections approaching, U.S. Rep. Patrick McHenry is following in President Donald Trump’s footsteps on the campaign trail. McHenry, a Republican from Western North Carolina, distributed a newsletter on May 29 that targets the "liberal news media" and boasts about changes to the federal tax code that Congress passed last year. "Americans received the biggest tax cut in history last year, and Americans all over the country — including right here in Western North Carolina — are saving more of their hard-earned money each paycheck thanks to President Donald J. Trump," McHenry’s newsletter says. It asks for campaign donations, warning: "Obstructionist liberals are working nonstop to discredit our Make America Great Again agenda and thwart any progress for our great nation." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Claims about last year’s tax cuts being the "biggest" in American history — a frequent talking point of Trump himself — have already been debunked by PolitiFact. It’s unclear why McHenry’s campaign made the claim. The campaign didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment. Measuring cuts The Treasury Department has published a list of the biggest tax cuts and increases between 1940 and 2012, measured not only by contemporary dollars but also by inflation-adjusted dollars and as a percentage of gross domestic product (a measure of the size of the overall economy). Depending on what projection of the recent tax cut you use and what yardstick you measure it by, several bills since 1980 were larger. When measured by inflation-adjusted dollars, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (enacted in 2013) was the biggest cut since 1940 and last year’s tax cut ranks as the fourth-biggest. ' See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com When measured by the cut’s percentage of GDP, the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 is the largest tax cut and last year’s tax cut falls to seventh. ' See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Looking at GDP Economists generally prefer to measure the depth of tax cuts by their impact on GDP, said Michael Walden, economics professor at North Carolina State University. "[A]s the economy (GDP) becomes larger, it takes a bigger tax cut in dollar terms to have the same impact," Walden wrote in an email. Comparing tax cuts this way, "shows the Trump cuts ranked 5th among tax reduction legislation passed since 1964," he said, referencing a CNN analysis from earlier this year. So the depth of last year’s cuts have been overstated. As for who benefits, PolitiFact found that the cuts last the longest for the wealthiest Americans. Our ruling McHenry said "Americans received the biggest tax cut in history last year." That statement, which Trump has repeated, wasn’t true when he said it and it’s not true now. We rate it False.

pomt-08176	"The Republican plan for tax cuts is to give each millionaire -- the top 1 percent of income in this country -- $83,347 a year in tax cuts."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/nov/30/alan-grayson/alan-grayson-going-down-swinging-bush-tax-cut-exte/	File this under the category of things that won't surprise you -- Alan Grayson isn't leaving office quietly. The Orlando Democrat who lost his bid for re-election took to the U.S. House floor on Nov. 17, 2010, to rail against Republicans who want to extend the Bush 2001 and 2003 tax cuts for all Americans, including the wealthiest 1 percent of income earners. With a series of cardboard posters, Grayson mocked Republicans for more than five minutes. "The Republican plan for tax cuts is to give each millionaire -- each person who makes $1.4 million a year on average, the top 1 percent of income in this country, the high and mighty -- $83,347 a year in tax cuts," Grayson said, turning to his posters. Grayson said the wealthiest could use the money to buy a 2011 Mercedes-Benz E-Class sedan, once a year, every year for the next decade. Or they could buy a Hermes "Birkin" handbag every year or a bottle of 1787 Chateau d'Yquem wine. "Here's something else they can do," Grayson said, showing the next poster. "They can buy 20,000 jars of their favorite mustard, Grey Poupon. Twenty thousand jars. That's certainly enough for them, their family, their friends, even a few poor people. "Thank you Republican Party." Grayson came back on Nov. 18, 2010, and continued poking the GOP -- saying the money could be used to buy three tickets to the most expensive suite at the Super Bowl, to climb Mt. Everest, or for a 110-day couple's cruise around the world. ("Not just one year, but every single year," he said.) Grayson's point is that the money could be better used creating jobs than going to America's top earners. That the country could essentially take the money and hire 3 million people at $30,000 a year, creating jobs instead of lining the pockets of the rich. There's some false logic in his thinking, at least from the Republican point of view. Republicans say it's those top earners who create jobs and taking money out of their pockets will cost jobs. Grayson also certainly is guilty of hyperbole in suggesting that the rich will use the money saved from the tax cuts only on outrageous luxury items. But that's all a philosophical debate we'll let you have at your dinner tables. For PolitiFact Florida, we wanted to zero in on his baseline number, that the Republican plan for extending the 2001, 2003 and other Bush-era tax cuts would result in the top 1 percent of earners paying $83,347 a year less in taxes. Grayson said his figure comes from an analysis provided by a liberal public policy group called Citizens for Tax Justice. Citizens for Tax Justice Legislative Director Steve Wamhoff backs up Grayson's numbers, saying that if all of the tax cuts scheduled to expire at the end of this year remain in place, the top 1 percent of earners will save $83,347 on average. But there's more to the story, Wamhoff said. First, extending all of the Bush-era tax cuts for everyone isn't exactly "the Republican plan." Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell introduced a bill on Sept. 13 that would extend most of the Bush-era tax cuts, and would restore the estate tax, at some level, for some people. The effect of the McConnell bill is that the top 1 percent of income earners would see a total cut of $74,621, according to Citizens for Tax Justice. Another bill filed on Nov. 17 by Republicans Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana and Sen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina would permanently repeal the estate tax for everyone, meaning the top 1 percent would see the cut suggested by Grayson -- $83,347, using Citizens for Tax Justice numbers. And there's a second caveat. Democrats, including President Barack Obama, want to extend some of the tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans too. Just not to the extent that Republicans do. While President Obama's preferred alternative is to extend the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts for only those individuals making $200,000 or less and couples making $250,000 or less, he does support extending other tax cuts that would benefit wealthier Americans, including restoring a reduced estate tax. Under Obama's plan, the top 1 percent of earners would pay $28,728 a year less in taxes than they would if all of the tax cuts were allowed to expire at the end of the year, according to Citizens for Tax Justice. How does this all add up? If all of the tax cuts are allowed to expire, the wealthiest 1 percent will pay around $83,347 a year more in federal taxes on average. If President Obama's plan is approved, the wealthiest 1 percent will pay about $54,619 a year more in federal taxes than they do now. If McConnell's bill passes, they'll pay $8,726 a year more. And if the DeMint/Pence plan passes, they'll pay the same amount. Now we know you're probably wondering if Citizens for Tax Justice's numbers are credible, especially since they define themselves as being liberal. We did, too. So we also checked with the Tax Policy Center, an independent, nonpartisan think tank. They didn't measure things exactly like Citizens for Tax Justice, but they did corroborate one critical fact. They found that if President Obama's tax plan becomes law, the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans would pay $53,674 a year more, on average, in federal taxes (CTJ's number was $54,619). We also found research from the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation -- a nonpartisan committee with a professional staff of economists, attorneys and accountants -- that helps illustrate the same point, though by using slightly different criteria. The Joint Committee on Taxation found that, for those who have income of $1 million or more, extending all of the Bush tax cuts would mean $32.7 billion that the government would not collect in 2011. That amount would apply to 315,000 tax filers. Divide the foregone tax revenues by the number of filers, and you get $103,809 per tax filer. That's a bigger number than Citizens for Tax Justice, but also applies to a different pool of people. And it substantiates Grayson's broader point, which is that extending the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans means they will save a lot of money in federal taxes. In a pair of dramatic House floor speeches, he said that the Republican plan to extend the Bush-era tax cuts would result in the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans saving $83,347 a year. He's quoting a study from the group Citizens for Tax Justice accurately, and the math is largely backed up by the more independent Tax Policy Center. But he neglects to mention that another GOP-embraced tax plan would shrink the tax savings of the wealthiest Americans slightly and that a significant chunk of the tax cuts he's talking about are also supported by Democrats and President Obama. So we rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Alan Grayson	None	None	None	2010-11-30T16:40:05	2010-11-17	['Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-06824	Says his Twitter account has 1.3 million followers.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2011/aug/09/newt-gingrich/gingrich-twitter-account-has-13-million-followers/	The 2012 presidential race has thus far been filled with weighty subjects like unemployment, federal spending and America’s military interests in the Middle East. But in the Web world, one big presidential issue that surfaced recently was whether Republican candidate and former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich’s seemingly sizable Twitter following is legit. The Gingrich campaign had to defend its candidate after the website Gawker published an article reporting that most of his 1.3 million Twitter followers are fake. Gingrich spokesman R.C. Hammond, in Twitter-like speed, denied the claim. "Gawker gaffed, hoodwinked their readers and insulted 1.3 million of Newt’s [Twitter followers]," Hammond told the New York Daily News. We were curious about Gingrich’s claim since he’s talked about his Twitter following to make a case that his campaign has a strong pulse. Politico reported a few weeks ago that Gingrich’s Twitter following far exceeded his Republican rivals, and even Sarah Palin, who frequently uses social media to spread her message. Gingrich, a former Georgia congressman, bragged about the Politico piece in a recent interview with the Marietta Daily Journal. "It turned out I have six times as many Twitter followers as all the other candidates combined," Gingrich told the Marietta Daily Journal. Politicians, some better than others, have been capitalizing on the social networking site where messages cannot exceed 140 characters as a faster way to engage supporters and potential voters and to weigh in on various issues. Gingrich embraced Twitter long before most political figures (he’s sent more than 2,700 tweets). Just a handful of American political figures, such as President Barack Obama, former Vice President Al Gore and U.S. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), have more Twitter followers than Gingrich. But Gawker cited an anonymous former Gingrich staffer who estimated about 80 percent of the followers were created by agencies that are inactive or dummy accounts. But others also have picked apart Gingrich’s Twitter following. The New York-based Web search index company PeekYou said it had done its own analysis of Gingrich’s Twitter account before the Gawker article surfaced. PeekYou CEO Michael Hussey said the company concluded only 8 percent of his Twitter followers were confirmed as "real human beings." The rest, he said, didn’t have real locations, used questionable names to register their Twitter accounts and/or didn’t have any other presence online. "We noticed a lot of the stuff out there are not actual people," said Hussey, a self-proclaimed Libertarian. Hussey said the other Republican presidential candidates all had a higher percentage of Twitter followers who could be confirmed. The range was from 27 to 32 percent. Some companies will offer coupons to people to follow various social media accounts, said Amy Bruckman, an associate professor in Georgia Tech’s School of Interactive Computing. Hussey pointed us to eBay, where people can pay companies to help them gather more Twitter followers (about $12.99 per 1,000). He’s dubious about many of these companies. He said their Twitter followers are often fake -- they use an illegitimate e-mail account. Hammond, the Gingrich spokesman, has strongly denied the campaign has used such tactics. With the ability of some companies to create fake accounts, does this mean that Lady Gaga, the queen of Twitter, doesn’t truly have 12.2 million followers? "She might have [some phony followers]," Hussey said. The Gingrich camp has noted that the candidate is on Twitter’s list of suggested users. Some estimates say being on that list can result in an additional 500 Twitter followers a day. Another group of researchers conducted a sample study of the Twitter followings of some of the GOP presidential candidates; Palin and Obama. The Center for Complex Networks and Systems Research looked at five categories, such as the percentage of users who never tweeted and didn’t have a profile biography. In each category, Gingrich had the highest percentage of Twitter followers who didn’t have such information in each field. They found 33 percent of Gingrich followers never tweeted. Palin was second with 17 percent of followers who never tweeted. Obama was third at 10 percent. About three-quarters of Gingrich followers didn’t have a profile biography. Palin and Obama were second and third, respectively, with 54 percent and 48 percent of their followers who didn’t have a profile biography. In their defense, Obama, Gingrich and Palin have the highest supposed number of Twitter followers, so it’s logical that they have a larger percentage of suspect Twitter accounts. The Center for Complex Networks and Systems Research, which is part of Indiana University, said it randomly sampled 5,000 Twitter followers of each candidate. PolitiFact Georgia looked at 1,000 Gingrich Twitter followers and found 27 percent of them had no picture, had never tweeted and little to no profile information. Many others with pictures had no profile information. Some social media experts note that there are well-intentioned people who join Twitter but wind up sending few or no tweets and don’t set up a profile picture. Still, Bruckman, the Georgia Tech professor, is dubious that all of Gingrich’s Twitter followers are real. "His sheer number of followers seems out of proportion to his standing in the polls," said Bruckman, who’s been at school since 1997 and once talked with Gingrich about social networking. "Those numbers should be correlated." In response to our questions, Hammond sent us a press release that says Twitter is solely responsible for each Twitter user’s legitimacy. "We will now return to our efforts to confront the president about his inability to create jobs for the American economy. Thank you," it ended. So, does Newt Gingrich have about 1.3 million Twitter followers? Twitter still lists the candidate as having 1.3 million followers. The Gingrich camp said the Gawker article was an insult to those followers. But as we and others found, there is strong evidence that not all of these followers are real. There are Twitter followers and there are bona fide Twitter followers. Gingrich has 1.3 million of the former, not so many of the latter. We rate the campaign’s claim as Mostly False.

pomt-08557	Says the Feingold garage ad "is a fake: He’s not standing in front of his house."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2010/sep/29/mark-belling/mark-belling-says-sen-russ-feingold-faked-his-tv-a/	In a new TV ad, U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold goes back in history, reviving images from his successful 1992 campaign when he painted promises on his garage door in Middleton. Facing a tough re-election battle, the Wisconsin Democrat tells voters he owns the same house and is still the small-town fella they elected 18 years ago -- except that today he posts promises on a website instead of his garage. It’s not exactly what you would call an attack ad. But it was enough to open the door for an attack by WISN-AM talk radio host Mark Belling. "I’m going to make an accusation here, and I am very confident that I am correct in my accusation," Belling said in the first hour of his Sept. 28, 2010 program. "That ad is a fake. That ad is a fake. Feingold is not standing in front of his house in this new ad. They faked it." Belling said he checked out the ad himself and cited an expert source he said he could not identify. "Ninety minutes of my life today was spent frame-by-framing this through the Internet to find the tipoffs that have convinced me the ad is fake," he told his listeners. "…My contention is Russ is standing in the studio." On his website, Belling posted a link to the ad with this headline: "This Feingold Ad Is A Fake: He’s Not Standing In Front of His House." While our primary focus at PolitiFact Wisconsin is fact-checking the promises, claims and accusations made by elected officials and candidates, we will also examine the words of other voices who shape the political discourse. This was a strong accusation: Did a U.S. Senate candidate aiming to show off his roots back home fake the scene from a far-off TV studio? Belling wasn’t the only person to suggest it. A political blog affiliated with the conservative National Review said it appeared that Feingold had filmed his portion of the commercial elsewhere, in front of a "green screen," and then was superimposed in front of the Middleton house. This note was picked up by National Public Radio in a weekly game show heard by some 3 million people. Both the blog and NPR withdrew their suggestions after the Feingold campaign complained it wasn’t true. We asked Belling for his evidence. "I have none," he said in an e-mail to PolitiFact Wisconsin. "It’s an accusation. They can deny it and if they're right, I'll admit it. "But it's very fishy." He went on to highlight his suspicions, including: "The bushes throw off a shadow; Feingold doesn’t"; and "His wave to the house looks fake. Why wave to a house when you’re in front of it." Also, the light is shining from the left, but Feingold’s left side "doesn’t seem lit,’’ Belling wrote. And the feet: "Why do you not see Russ's feet? It's much harder to make it appear he's standing on something than in front of it." Belling declined to name his source, other than to say he was involved in video production and shared his suspicions. "I have no proof,’’ Belling said. "I'm making an accusation that it's faked, and they can confirm or deny it." So, we asked Feingold. Was he standing in his driveway when the ad was shot? "I’m trying not to laugh," Feingold said. "Yes." After spending the night at his Middleton house, Feingold said, he attended the dedication of a war memorial in Sauk Prairie on Aug. 28 while the production crew set up in the driveway. Then he returned home to shoot the commercial. His campaign provided a still photo shot during the filming that shows Feingold in front of the house with a crew member identified as Rob Wernette, a freelance grip from Milwaukee. An employee for the WisPolitics.com website also saw the ad being filmed, with Feingold standing in his driveway. Jeff Mayers, president of WisPolitics, said one of his employees saw Feingold filming the ad in front of his home and the employee confirmed it when contacted by PolitiFact Wisconsin. Feingold said plenty of folks passed by the house during the two-hour filming, some beeping and giving him a thumbs up. Feingold complained that he has received a lot of "cheap shots,’’ but that "this is the dumbest one of all time.’’ We’re not aware of any ranking of cheap shots, so we won’t weigh in on that. As for Belling’s accusation, the veteran talk show host tried to turn Feingold’s own ad against him, to suggest he’s so out of touch with state voters that he was even out of state when the ad was filmed. He said he based his assertion on his own review of the photography and on one unnamed source, who had no knowledge of how the shoot was conducted but who thought it looked fishy. As for Belling’s proof, we’ll use his own words to describe it: "I have none." And we’ll add three words of our own: Pants on Fire. (Note: On Sept. 30, 2010, Belling changed his position and said the Feingold ad was not faked).	None	Mark Belling	None	None	None	2010-09-29T14:14:07	2010-09-28	['None']
pomt-09569	"A majority of Americans still oppose this health care bill."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/28/john-boehner/boehner-says-majority-americans-oppose-health-care/	In a live-blogging response to President Barack Obama's State of the Union Address, House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, wrote that "a majority of Americans still oppose this health care bill." We looked at recent polls to see if Boehner was correct. Using the archive at the Web site pollster.com, we found 10 relevant polls taken in January 2010 that were nonpartisan and conducted by telephone -- traditional benchmarks for highly credible polls. The exact wording of the questions varied from poll to poll, but all asked whether the respondent supports or opposes the health care plan being considered in Congress. Five out of the 10 polls found that a clear majority of respondents opposed the health care bill. From most recent to oldest, they were: • CNN: 38 percent in favor and 58 percent opposed • ABC News/Washington Post: 44 percent in favor and 51 percent opposed • Fox News: 39 percent in favor and 51 percent oppposed • Quinnipiac University: 34 percent in favor and 54 percent opposed • Another poll from CNN: 40 percent in favor and 57 percent opposed Two other polls found a sizable plurality -- but not a majority -- of respondents opposing the health care bill: • NBC News/Wall Street Journal: 31 percent in favor and 46 percent opposed • Another poll from NBC News/Wall Street Journal: 33 percent in favor and 46 percent opposed One showed a tie: • Associated Press/GfK: 42 percent for each view And two showed a narrow plurality in support of the health care bill, but within the poll's margin of error: • Kaiser Family Foundation/Princeton Survey Research Associates: 42 percent in favor and 41 percent opposed • Gallup: 49 percent in favor and 46 percent opposed The Gallup poll may have attracted somewhat more support because of the question's wording, which did not refer to the specific health care bills now being considered. That poll's question was, "Would you advise your Member of Congress to vote for or against a health care bill this year, or do you not have an opinion?" But even that question could not garner a plurality of support outside the margin of error. A major factor accounting for the differences in these poll results was that some had large percentages of respondents saying they had no opinion or were uncertain, while others did not. Seven of the polls did not offer an explicit "no opinion" option when asking the question, and five of those polls led to outright majorities for opponents of the health care bill. By contrast, among the three polls that did offer a "no opinion" option, one was the Gallup poll showing a plurality in favor of the health care plan, a second was the AP poll showing a tie, and a third was the NBC poll showing 31 percent in favor and 46 percent opposed. These differences are illuminated by a separate line of questioning in the Kaiser poll. That poll demonstrated that respondents are not always sure what policies are actually included in the health care proposal. When presented with a list of policy provisions, 8 percent to 25 percent of respondents, depending on the provision, said they were not sure if the idea was included in the proposal or not. "Even after a year of substantial media coverage of the health reform debate, many Americans remain unfamiliar with key elements of the major bills passed by the House and Senate," Kaiser concluded. The foundation added that "awareness can matter. Among the least known elements of the bills, those with the biggest potential to change minds include the fact that the Congressional Budget Office has said health reform would reduce the deficit (only 15% expect the legislation to reduce the deficit, but 56% said hearing that makes them more supportive) and that the legislation would stop insurers from charging women more than men (37% are aware that the legislation would do this, but 50% said this provision makes them more supportive)." So, Boehner would have been on firm ground if he'd said that more Americans oppose the health care bill than support it. Instead, he said "a majority of Americans still oppose this health care bill," something that was strictly true in only half the January polls we looked at. That said, Boehner is not far off. In none of the 10 polls we looked at did supporters outnumber opponents by an amount larger than the margin of error. So we'll knock down the minority leader for his imprecise language and rate his statement Mostly True.	None	John Boehner	None	None	None	2010-01-28T13:58:23	2010-01-27	['United_States']
pomt-05919	Says the U.S. federal income tax rate was 0 percent until 1913.	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/jan/31/ron-paul/ron-paul-says-federal-income-tax-rate-was-0-percen/	Asked at a recent Republican presidential debate to specify what the highest federal income tax rate should be, the candidates offered various figures: 15 percent from Newt Gingrich, 20 percent from Rick Perry, 25 percent from Mitt Romney, and 28 percent from Rick Santorum. When it was Ron Paul’s turn to respond, the Texas congressman undercut the previous answers, saying: "We should have the lowest tax that we’ve ever had, and up until 1913, it was 0 percent. What’s so bad about that?" It’s no secret that Paul favors smaller government and less taxation. His campaign website says that as president, he would support a constitutional amendment to abolish the income tax. If that can’t be done, however, the web page says, another way to bring the income tax rate to 0 percent would be to restrain federal spending "by enforcing the Constitution’s strict limits on the federal government’s power." PolitiFact has delved into the history of the federal income tax for previous fact-checks, and PolitiFact Texas explored its origins in December 2010 after Perry linked Woodrow Wilson, the Progressive movement and the income tax while promoting his book Fed Up! That look noted Americans first paid an income tax 50 years before Wilson’s presidency, after Congress approved one in 1861 to help cover the expenses of the Civil War; it expired in 1872. So, is it accurate to say Americans paid a zero income tax rate until 1913? Let’s review the history. First of all, Paul had a reason for mentioning 1913; the 16th Amendment to the Constitution was ratified that year, legalizing a federal income tax, and Congress approved legislation enacting one. The 1913 law imposed a tax of 1 percent on income up to $20,000, for both individual and joint filers. However, exemptions from the tax — the first $3,000 of income for individuals and the first $4,000 for joint filers — meant "virtually all middle-class Americans" were excused from paying, according to W. Elliot Brownlee’s book, Federal Taxation in America. The law also put in place a graduated surtax on incomes above $20,000; the highest rate paid, 7 percent, applied to Americans making more than $500,000 (about $11.4 million in 2011 dollars). The amendment’s ratification came nearly two decades after the U.S. Supreme Court in 1895 voided an income tax that Congress had approved a year earlier. That tax never took effect. The court declared the tax unconstitutional because it was not apportioned according to the population of each state, as the Constitution then required. That meant, for example, that if 5 percent of the U.S. population lived in Virginia, no more than 5 percent of the tax’s total revenue could come from Virginia. The 16th Amendment removed this barrier by authorizing Congress to collect taxes on incomes "without apportionment among the several states, and without regard to any census or enumeration." To gauge how the income tax worked in its first incarnation, we consulted sources detailing the Civil War-era levy — including two history books and the Tax History Museum website, a project of the nonprofit group Tax Analysts, based in Falls Church, Va. The sources don’t concur on every detail, but how the tax came to be comes clear. Congress enacted the nation’s first federal income tax in 1861, setting a flat rate of 3 percent on incomes higher than $800. Over the next four years, Congress expanded the tax as members cut the amount of income that could be exempted and introduced higher, graduated rates. By 1865, the last year of the Civil War, the highest income tax rate, 10 percent, was applied to income in excess of $5,000, according to Roy and Gladys Blakey’s 1940 book, The Federal Income Tax. According to Brownlee’s book, more than 10 percent of Union households were paying the income tax at the end of the war. With hostilities over, however, Congress was eager to reduce the tax burden, so it began raising the tax’s income exemption level and lowering the rate. By 1870, the exemption level had been increased to $2,000 and the rate reduced to 2.5 percent. According to the Blakeys’ book, the lawmakers of the Civil War era intended the income tax to be a temporary wartime tool. At least four of the income tax measures enacted during the war and soon after contained a provision saying that the law was to be in force until 1870 and "no longer," the Blakeys wrote. Ultimately, Congress voted to let the income tax expire in 1872. We checked in with Joseph Thorndike, director of Tax Analysts’ Tax History Project, who told us that he thought Paul’s statement at the debate was fair. Pointing to the temporary nature of the wartime tax and the four decades that the United States went without an income tax before 1913, Thorndike said his view is that the Civil War-era tax should be a "relatively small caveat" to the statement that there was no federal income tax until 1913. Our ruling Paul’s statement that the federal income tax rate was zero until 1913 reflects the timing of the constitutional change enabling the current tax. But his claim disregards two pre-1913 efforts to impose an income tax — one of which was in place for a decade. This debate claim rates Half True.

pomt-11477	Says Keanu Reeves said, "For me, Trump is the symbol of a successful man and a role model for every young American, something that our nation was looking for for year. I don’t think that America will again have a leader like him."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/05/blog-posting/no-keanu-reeves-did-not-call-donald-trump-role-mod/	An online hoax purports to quote actor Keanu Reeves expressing full-throated support for President Donald Trump. The item appears on the website supporttrumppresidency.blogspot.com, and contains a banner headline that reads: "For me, Trump is the symbol of a successful man and a role model for every young American, something that our nation was looking for for year. I don’t think that America will again have a leader like him." But neither the text contained in the body of the article, nor a video embedded in the post, supports the emphatic headline. The body of the article is entirely unrelated to politics. It tells an anecdote of Reeves' experience on set during the shooting of the 1994 action film Speed, co-starring Sandra Bullock. The video at the end of the post shows an interview Reeves did with a journalist in Uruguay, in which he discussed his early career and current film projects. Neither the text nor the video mentions politics, much less the actor's views on Trump. In fact, the only instance we found of Reeves discussing Trump publicly is when he appeared to criticize the president’s travel ban during a January 2017 question-and-answer with journalists at a red carpet event. Reeves told a journalist he believed the travel ban was "just terrible," according to a Jan. 31, 2017, Associated Press article. The only other references we found to Reeves' putative support for Trump were from other dubious websites that repeated the same baseless quote. Reeves' publicist confirmed the quote is fake. "It is completely false," said Cheryl Maisel, of talent agency PMK-BNC. "He never made those comments nor did he ever do that interview. All manufactured." This is not the first time Reeves has been the subject of a fake quote. We previously checked a lengthy cultural critique misattributed to Reeves, which we rated Pants on Fire.

pomt-06752	The 2009-11 state budget that Democrats approved left Wisconsin taxpayers $3.6 billion in debt.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/aug/24/jonathan-steitz/republican-candidate-jonathan-steitz-says-democrat/	Gov. Scott Walker signed the 2011-13 state budget in June. But that didn’t stop the spending plan from playing a prominent role in the state Senate recall campaigns in August. Republicans worked to paint their Democratic opponents -- the members of the Assembly running against GOP senators and Democratic senators defending their seats -- as reckless spenders who left a mess to be cleaned up. The refrain was that the Democratic lawmakers, along with former Gov. Jim Doyle, are to blame for the state being bankrupt or broke. There were many variations of it, but one seemed worth visiting even though the recall elections are over. Why? Some claims have a way of being recycled for future campaigns. The one we are looking at came in a radio ad by Republican Jonathan Steitz, who lost his bid to unseat Sen. Robert Wirch (D-Pleasant Prairie) in the Aug. 16, 2011 recall election The ad said: "Wirch voted to raise job-killing taxes by $4.7 billion, and voted for $3.6 billion in out-of-control reckless government spending ... and after all those taxes and all that spending ... Wirch left us with three billion in debt... only to flee to Illinois instead of staying to get the job done." Call it the $3.6 billion question. Or, in this case, $3.6 billion accusation. We previously rated False a statement by state Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Madison) that Walker’s estimate of the budget deficit was a "bogus figure." We also found Doyle’s late 2010 estimate of the size of the deficit was False, in part because it included many assumptions about what Walker might do. And we found Walker’s statement that the state was "broke" to be False. (We’ve also ruled on several statements about the "structural deficit" -- an entirely different matter.) See what we mean about themes coming up again and again? So, back to the claim: Did Democrats under Doyle approve a budget that left the state in debt? Not a deficit. Debt. The short answer is no. That’s not how the budget process works, said Robert Lang, director of the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. The state constitution requires lawmakers approve a budget that’s balanced, and the budget that was passed for 2009-11 was no exception. The $3.6 billion figure came about when the state budget office looked at the 2009-2011 budget, as plans were being readied for the next one (the 2011-13 budget). The report considers tax revenue projections and what agencies plan to spend in the next budget, and came up with what Lang termed a "shortfall." To be sure, the calculation depended on which party is running the budget office. In November 2010, the outgoing Doyle administration said the shortfall was $1.5 billion, which was far lower than the $2.7 billion figure used by candidates during the campaign for governor. In February 2011, Walker’s Department of Administration ran its own version of the numbers and concluded that the shortfall was $3.6 billion. So what does that number represent? "It’s a challenge," Lang said of the figure. "The challenge for the 2011-13 budget was $3.6 billion." In other words, that was the amount -- through a combination of spending cuts, tax increases or other measures -- that the state budget would have to be adjusted to account for all of the department budget requests and the projected tax revenue. One thing is clear: The $3.6 billion was not a debt, as Steitz claimed. Debt is something that is owed, typically over the long term. Borrowed money, for instance. The state did not borrow, bond or otherwise owe money to anyone because of the $3.6 billion. Other steps -- some very controversial politically -- were taken to address the gap. Lang put it this way: "We did not have a deficit, nor were we in debt." Lang noted that the shorthand for the shortfall, including in Journal Sentinel news accounts, was a "deficit" -- but rarely, if ever, a debt. That brings us to the bottom line: Steitz claimed that the 2009-2011 budget approved by Democrats created a $3.6 billion debt for Walker and the new Republican Legislature. Under the state constitution, the state budget has to be balanced. While some phrased the shortfall for the next two-year budget as a deficit, it certainly was not a debt. That comes with borrowed money that must be repaid. We rate the statement False.	None	Jonathan Steitz	None	None	None	2011-08-24T09:00:00	2011-08-03	['Wisconsin', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-03871	On raising taxes.	full flop	/virginia/statements/2013/mar/08/bob-mcdonnell/mcdonnell-does-full-flop-not-raising-taxes/	For better or worse, Gov. Bob McDonnell will be remembered for helping convince the General Assembly this winter to pass Virginia’s first major package of new transportation funding in 27 years. Supporters say the legislation -- which will eventually raise at least $880 million a year, mostly from new taxes and fees -- will pay for road building and maintenance projects that are vital to Virginia’s economy and quality of life. McDonnell heralded its passage on Feb. 23 as "a historic day in Virginia." But a group of conservatives still hoping to stop the plan is accusing McDonnell of breaking a 2009 campaign commitment to not raise taxes. The opponents include bloggers at Americans for Tax Reform, Bearing Drift, and Jamie Radtke, a Virginia tea party organizer who unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate last year. Radtke has started a Facebook page, urging the governor to veto the plan he says he supports. She has written an online editorial accusing McDonnell of flip-flopping on taxes. "It is important to juxtapose Gov. McDonnell’s support of this massive tax increase with his rhetoric of the past," she wrote. Has McDonnell changed his position on increasing taxes for roads? We decided to submit the question to our Flip-O-Meter. Let’s start by traveling back to the 2009 campaign. McDonnell -- despite coaxing from Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform -- did not sign a pledge to oppose all tax increases. But he made it clear that he rejected raising levies. That July, he issued a transportation plan that criticized then-Gov. Tim Kaine’s administration of "being so wedded to funding new transportation investments solely through new taxes that it has dragged its feet on several viable alternatives." McDonnell proposed raising money for roads without increasing taxes by privatizing the state’s liquor stores and issuing bonds. He also wanted to dedicate to transportation a portion of annual revenue growth and budget surpluses, and all money that would come to the state if the White House allowed drilling for oil and natural gas off Virginia’s coast. Critics said McDonnell’s created a few windfalls for transportation but failed to tap a reliable new stream of funding to build and maintain roads over the long run. That August, the Associated Press interviewed McDonnell for an hour and quoted him as saying, "Any general increase in the taxes of Virginia I’m not going to support. I’m not planning to raise taxes. That’s the best I can tell you." On Sept. 11, 2009 -- as Radtke notes on her website -- McDonnell was interviewed on WTOP radio in Washington. "So, no tax will be raised during your four-year term?" the host, Mark Plotkin, asked. "I’m going to be able to find other ways to fund transportation," McDonnell replied. Two newspapers reported that McDonnell pledged not to raise taxes during a Sept. 17, 2009, debate against his Democratic opponent, state Sen. Creigh Deeds of Bath County. "McDonnell said he would not raise taxes as governor," said an article the next day in the Richmond Times-Dispatch. "After the debate, he said he would not sign a transportation bill submitted to him by the legislature if it included any tax increase." The Roanoke Times reported, "McDonnell insisted he would not raise taxes." McDonnell emphasized that message by launching a TV commercial on Oct. 2 in which he spoke of the need to improve roads. "My plan: New money for transportation, while protecting education and not raising taxes," he said. Four days later, McDonnell aired another TV ad assailing Deeds for supporting a gas tax increase to pay for roads. "Creigh Deeds has unequivocally committed himself to higher taxes," the announcer said. "...His $1 billion tax increase would add 20 cents to a gallon of gas." Now, let’s return to 2013. On. Jan. 9, McDonnell proposed a plan to raise $640 million a year for transportation. He called for eliminating the 17.5-cents-per-gallon excise tax on gasoline and increasing the state’s 5 percent sales tax to 5.8 percent. The governor also wanted to raise the motor vehicle registration fee and create a fee for alternative fuel vehicles. The proposal was extensively amended by the General Assembly. On Feb. 23, lawmakers passed a bipartisan deal that would raise $880 million a year -- about $680 million of which would come from tax increases. The legislation would replace the per-gallon excise levy with a 3.5 percent tax on gasoline and 6 percent diesel tax at the wholesale level, raise the state sales tax to 5.3 percent and increase the 3 percent motor vehicle sales tax to 4.3 percent. In addition, Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads would be empowered to impose a 0.7 percent local sales tax and other regional levies that could raise $558 million a year for transportation. McDonnell has yet to sign the bill. But he has expressed his strong support, saying the legislation "fixed the problem" of sufficiently funding transportation and thanking lawmakers who voted for it. What explains the governor’s change of heart? Tucker Martin, the governor’s chief of communications, said transportation problems were worsening and McDonnell ran out of options, short of general tax increases, to fix them. Martin noted in an email that two of McDonnell’s proposals to raise money for roads failed: the General Assembly had no desire to sell state liquor stores and the White House did not approve offshore drilling in Virginia. Martin mentioned other steps McDonnell took to spur road building prior to this year. The governor audited the Virginia Department of Transportation and found $1 billion in unspent money about about $400 million in efficiencies that were redirected to road projects. Virginia has issued more than $1.7 billion in transportation bonds since McDonnell took office. The state is selling sponsorships and naming rights for roads. "None of those actions were enough," Martin wrote. He noted that a 2012 study by the Texas Transportation Institute at Texas A&M University found that the Northern Virginia-Washington region has the worst traffic congestion in the nation. Hampton Roads was ranked the 20th worst. Martin said the governor became increasingly concerned that the congestion "was negatively impacting Virginia’s economic competitiveness." McDonnell’s aversion to tax increases, Martin wrote, took a backseat to another campaign pledge. "The governor’s foremost campaign promise was to do everything in his power to help the private sector create good-paying jobs for our citizens," he said. "...Virginians won’t find good jobs without a 21st century transportation system that will help job creators." We should note that the last two Virginia governors to sign major tax increases, Democrats Gerald Baliles in 1986 and Mark Warner in 2004, promised during their campaigns that they would not increase levies. The record shows McDonnell, too, changed his position on not raising taxes. Some may applaud him for bold leadership, others may criticize him for breaking faith. We won’t enter that debate. Our goal is to document his record and, in this instance, he did a Full Flop.	None	Bob McDonnell	None	None	None	2013-03-08T13:58:38	2013-03-08	['None']
pomt-13022	Latina who enthusiastically supported Donald Trump on stage in Las Vegas in October 2015 has been deported.	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2016/dec/05/blog-posting/fake-news-alert-claim-famed-latina-trump-supporter/	Donald Trump alienated a share of immigrant voters during his presidential campaign after making controversial remarks about Mexicans, but that didn’t deter a Hispanic woman from eagerly showing her support for him during a campaign rally. "I am Hispanic and I vote for Mr. Trump! We vote for Mr. Trump! Yes, Mr. Trump! We love you, we love you all the way to the White House!" Myriam Witcher said enthusiastically into a microphone, flailing her arms up in the air while gripping an American flag and a People magazine with Trump on the cover. Witcher, an immigrant from Colombia, garnered attention for her lavish praises during the October 2015 rally in Las Vegas, particularly because Trump had presented a hard-line immigration stance, including talk of mass deportation. Soon after her on-stage appearance, rumors spread that Witcher had been deported. A PolitiFact Texas reader recently emailed us saying reports of her deportation were being shared widely, including on Facebook. We wondered, where’s Witcher? Still on U.S. soil, Witcher told PolitiFact. Rumors of her deportation started last year despite being a naturalized U.S. citizen, Witcher said via a phone interview. Though she lives in Las Vegas, Witcher on Nov. 30 said she was in New York. According to the rumors, "up to this day, I’m still deported," Witcher said. "I don’t waste my time with that." Satirical post and other sites On Oct. 9, 2015, the day after Witcher appeared next to Trump, a Spanish-language satirical website based in Colombia posted an article headlined, "They deport Colombian who declared her love to Trump." Actualidad Panamericana’s 257-word satirical post said Witcher’s return to Colombia was expected after a quick deportation order from immigration authorities. The piece said Witcher’s immigration papers showed "serious inconsistencies" and that her real name was "Miriam Encanto" -- a spelling variation of her first name and a word for her last name that in English means "charm." The post says that Witcher was picked up by immigration authorities while having dinner with Trump, and that enforcement officials showed up after receiving a call from a "patriot with a toupee." An Actualidad Panamericana editor said they believe rumors of Witcher’s deportation surged from their post. On its website, Actualidad Panamericana says its goal is to entertain and that all its content is fiction and does not correspond with reality. Talks of Witcher’s deportation are also posted on another Spanish-language website, Coyotitos.com, a site that lacks information detailing who’s behind it and the mission. The article on Witcher and other posts don’t have publication dates or bylines indicating who wrote them. Their Facebook page says they are a media/news company, but they did not return a message requesting more information. Coyotitos’ post about Witcher is headlined, "Hispanic woman who supported Donald Trump has been deported by the Department of Migration." (There is no such department.) The article says different media outlets have started to report what happened to Witcher, "who has been deported for not having legal ‘immigration status.’" The post warns the information has not been officially confirmed despite being widespread and that it should be taken with caution. Media interviews Anthony Avellaneda, a journalist for El Tiempo, a Hispanic publication of the Las Vegas Review-Journal, said he has occasionally interviewed Witcher. He quoted her in an article posted Sept. 9, 2016. "She’s still here in Las Vegas. She has not been deported," Avellaneda said, adding that news of her removal stemmed from satirical posts. Witcher also was featured in a video published Nov. 1 by a German publication, Spiegel Online. Witcher appears standing outside the Trump International hotel in Las Vegas and reaffirms her admiration for Trump. Witcher says she’s a citizen and sports a Trump campaign pin on her blazer as well as a "Vote Early Today" sticker. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has an online search page to locate detainees who are in custody or who have been released within the last 60 days. There’s no result for Myriam Witcher. (We checked the database for other variations of her name, too.) An Oct. 9, 2015, article by the Las Vegas Sun about Witcher’s encounter with Trump reported that Witcher said she "had to wait five years to earn legal status in the U.S." Witcher published a book in May about Trump that includes information about her immigration status. "After immigrating to the United States and becoming a U.S. citizen, she has developed a deep appreciation for our country, and believes with all her heart that Mr. Trump will put America first and make our country great again. She is married to a native U.S. citizen from Texas, who is a veteran of the U.S. Navy submarine service," reads Witcher’s book author description. Witcher campaigned for Trump, posting dozens of videos on her YouTube channel recapping his immigration plan and encouraging viewers to vote for him. Gail J. Anderson, a deputy secretary within the Nevada Secretary of State office, said a Myriam Witcher born in 1960 and a registered voter in Clark County voted in this year’s general election. Our ruling News has spread on social media saying Myriam Witcher, a Trump supporter who made headlines for effusively showing her admiration for him during a rally, has been deported. In a phone interview, Witcher said she’s a U.S. citizen who has not been deported and is still a Trump supporter. In 2015, a Colombian website wrote a satirical piece a day after Witcher appeared with Trump on TV. The post said Witcher had been ordered deported and would be returning to Colombia within days. Journalists have interviewed Witcher on U.S. soil in the past few months. An online search tool for immigration detainees shows no result for Witcher.

pomt-13754	The U.S. has to go to "plane graveyards" and museums to get parts for its 20-year-old jet fighters while it sells new jets to other countries.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2016/jul/23/donald-trump/donald-trump-claims-military-jets-need-salvage-par/	"Trump Force One," as Donald Trump’s Boeing 757 has been nicknamed, has drawn attention for years. A 2011 tour of the renovated jet, posted on Trump’s YouTube channel, has been viewed more than 8 million times. Its 24-karat gold-plated seat belts have been catalogued by the New York Times and the Washington Post. But does Trump know his stuff when it comes to the state of U.S. military aviation? At a June 16, 2016 stop in Dallas during a Trump fundraising swing through Texas, he ripped into U.S. reliance on outdated aircraft while selling newer technology to allies, telling the crowd: "Remember, we’re the ones with the jet fighters that are 20 years old that we have to go to graveyards, plane graveyards, to get parts to use on our jet fighters, to have our great young people to fly in planes where they go into junk yards and museums to get parts for current fighters, while our opponents and our so-called allies are buying our planes, and they’ve got the new beautiful versions of them, and we’ve got old planes, I mean literally obsolete planes. It’s not going to happen anymore, folks, ok?" The comments made us wonder — is the U.S. military really scrounging for parts in junkyards and museums? Are our jets really decades old? And do we sell newer and better planes to our allies while keeping older, inferior versions for ourselves? The Trump campaign did not return a request for backup for Trump’s claim, and the Air Force did not respond to repeated requests for comment, so we did some searching and asked a few third-party experts for information on Trump’s points. As it turns out, it’s true that some of U.S. military planes are 20 years old — and some are much older. Contacted by email, Carl Rhodes, director of Force Modernization and Employment Program at RAND Project AIR FORCE, a federally funded research and development center that provides analytical support to the Air Force, told us "some are over 60 years old like the B-52" while "others are brand new, like the F-22 and F-35." At a Feb. 9, 2016, news conference, Major General James F. Martin Jr., the Air Force deputy assistant secretary for budget, said the average age of its aircraft is over 27. The Air Force Posture Statement for fiscal year 2017, released on February 10, 2016, states that makes the current fleet the oldest ever: "While our Airmen remain heavily engaged around the world, the average age of our aircraft is at an all-time high, and the size of our force and state of our full-spectrum readiness are at or near all-time lows." So, Trump has a point about the U.S. Air Force relying on older planes. To our inquiry, Rhodes also confirmed that Air Force maintenance workers pull parts from warehoused planes, directing us to a Jan. 30, 2013 news feature story in AIRMAN, published by the Air Force Office of Public Affairs. According to the story, reclamation teams with the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group save time and money by pulling parts that are still functional from shelved planes, sparing the Air Force from waiting longer for new parts to be made. According to a fact sheet we spotted on the Air Force’s website, since 1964, U.S. military aircraft have been stored and disposed of by Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona. Davis-Monthan was first established as an aircraft storage facility following World War II. According to a February 4, 2003 PBS story, the practice of removing parts from the junked planes dates to the 1950s. So, must the government go to "graveyards" to get parts? "Probably not," Rhodes told us, "but it can save quite a bit of money versus buying all new parts and keeping a sufficient stockpile." How much money, exactly? Col. Robert Lepper, Commander of the 309th AMARG, told an Arizona news service in 2014 that the group returns about a half billion dollars worth of parts into service each year. Rhodes also offered an example that supports Trump’s claim that in some cases, the U.S. sells planes more advanced than the ones they themselves are using. "We are selling F-16s to the UAE which are more advanced than our USAF F-16s," he said. Rhodes pointed us to a January 2014 news post on Defense Industry Daily, a trade publication focused on defense acquisition, stating the United Arab Emirates invested $3 billion in research to develop the planes, which are made by Lockheed Martin. Lockheed Martin, the number one US government contractor overall and within the Air Force sub-sector in fiscal year 2015, reported about 20% of their annual sales revenue came from sales to foreign entities, according to their SEC filings from 2010. Their filings report aircraft sales to countries including Israel, Kuwait, South Korea, and Tunisia. Over 25 countries purchased Lockheed Martin’s F-16 Fighting Falcon, and 15 have purchased the C-130J Super Hercules. Boeing is the number two Air Space contractor. Some 62% of Boeing’s Defense, Space and Security Revenue comes from the U.S. Department of Defense, according to the company’s 2015 annual report. International customers account for "roughly one-third of revenue and 40 percent of current backlog" for the company. International sales account for a much smaller portion of the sales of the number three company, Northrop Grumman, according to their annual report -- 14 percent of the $23.5 billion total. The U.S. government’s own Defense Security Cooperation Agency’s web site acknowledges an uptick in foreign demand, noting in a 2014 publication, "While the United States and European Union are cutting their defense expenditures, several countries — particularly in East Asia, South Asia, the Middle East, and South America — are increasing expenditures. Hence, U.S. Contractors are increasingly seeking to sell products and services to these markets." But experts we spoke to said that selling planes to other nations isn’t relevant to the state of our own military aviation. Todd Harrison, director of Defense Budget Analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, commented by email: "The fact that U.S. companies are selling planes to other countries is not relevant. Those same companies are also selling planes to the U.S. military right now, and in many cases the U.S. is getting significantly better aircraft than our allies and partners. And what would the alternative be — block U.S. companies from selling aircraft to others? Then our allies and partners would be less capable and even more dependent on us for security, putting an even greater strain on our forces." Obaid Younossi, director of resource management at RAND Project AIR FORCE, agreed by email that foreign military sales are a plus for the U.S. "We still make and keep the best of best for us: F-22, F-35, KC-46, F/A-18E/F, E-2D, and P-8. There are certainly versions of F-35 and F-18E/F we sell to our allies, but the vast majority of what is coming out of production is for our Services," Younossi wrote. "FMS [Foreign Military Sales] is good not only for strategic reasons but also for economic reasons. It keeps costs down for us, keeps our industrial base in business, and helps pay for development of technology (i.e. F-16 Block 60 and Kuwaiti investments)," Younossi said. "Do we need to worry about modernization?," Younossi wrote, adding: "Yes but not for reasons cited. Some of the old work horses can still do the job but we need new ones to counter future threats." In October 2015, the Pentagon awarded a contract to Northrop Grumman Corp. to build the first new bombers since the Cold War, which are to be deployed in the 2020s. Since Trump assured his audience "it’s not going to happen anymore, folks," it’s worth noting that updating the military’s aging fleet isn’t the kind of job that can be done overnight — nor is it fully within the hands of the executive branch, as funding levels, determined by Congress, have contributed to readiness problems. according to Air Force officials like Chief of Staff Mark Welsh and Secretary Deborah Lee James.. Our ruling While in Texas, Trump said the U.S. has to go to "plane graveyards" and museums to get parts for its 20-year-old jet fighters while it sells new jets to other countries. The government indeed salvages parts for military planes remaining in action and the U.S. also sells aircraft to militaries abroad. But clarification is needed. The described parts salvaging, which can save time and money, doesn’t appear to be misguided and the U.S. also buys new planes for its forces. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-08514	Marco Rubio "wants to raise the Social Security retirement age," and "cut benefits."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/oct/06/charlie-crist/fact-checking-marco-rubios-social-security-stance/	Charlie Crist's latest attack ad targets Republican U.S. Senate candidate Marco Rubio and hits on a touchy subject for elderly Floridians: Social Security. The 30-second ad aims to sway votes in a key demographic. Florida's 60 and older population makes up more than 30 percent of registered voters, and more than 40 percent voters who cast ballots in 2006. The ad, released Oct. 5, 2010, is called "Protect." Here's a transcript: Work longer, get by on less. That’s the Marco Rubio retirement plan. Rubio wants to raise the Social Security retirement age. That means you’ll work harder and longer for your money. And Rubio wants to cut benefits, though it’s already tough enough to make ends meet. That’s Washington for you – balance the budget on the backs of seniors. There’s a better choice. Charlie Crist is against raising the retirement age. He'll protect Social Security because our seniors have earned it. The claim that we're checking is that Rubio "wants to raise the Social Security retirement age" and "cut benefits." The Rubio campaign was ready and waiting for the Crist attack. The campaign issued a press release criticizing the ad at 10:32 a.m. on Oct. 5, 13 minutes before the Crist campaign sent out its press release announcing the ad (Apparently, the ad was posted earlier in the morning on the website YouTube). "In his latest desperate attempt to say and do anything to win an election, Charlie Crist has launched a desperate false attack ad designed solely to mislead Florida voters and scare seniors about Marco Rubio's Social Security position," the press release starts. "The ad falsely claims that Rubio wants to cut Social Security benefits to 'balance the budget on the backs of seniors.' This claim is demonstrably false." Within 30 minutes of Crist's announcement about the new ad, conservative commentator Stephen F. Hayes had penned almost 700 words about the Crist ad in a blog post titled, "A Desperate Charlie Crist Dishonestly Attacks Rubio," that regurgitates Rubio's talking points. And within three hours the world heard from former Gov. Jeb Bush. "Charlie Crist should be ashamed of his false attack against Marco Rubio on Social Security. Charlie Crist is purposely trying to scare seniors in order to win votes," Bush said. "The fact is, Marco Rubio will protect Social Security. His own mother relies on Social Security and he has repeatedly stated that he would not support or propose any benefit reductions for current retirees or people who are close to retirement." Thanks for the input spin, guys, but we'll handle the fact-checking, okay? More than 3.5 million Floridians receive Social Security benefits, according to the U.S. Social Security Administration. To be eligible to receive full benefits, a person must be between 65 and 67 (depending on what year they were born), be disabled, be a survivor of a worker who died, or be a dependent of Social Security beneficiaries. Social Security was a New Deal program created in 1935 to help elderly and other Americans with economic hardships. The program is funded by payroll taxes. This year, for the first time, Social Security will pay out more in benefits than it takes in. The deficit, approximately $41 billion, will be offset by money in the Social Security trust fund. By 2014, as the baby boomer generation retires, deficits are expected to increase, according to the Social Security and Medicare Boards of Trustees. By 2037, the trust fund will be empty, trustees predict, and incoming taxes will only be able to pay out 75 percent of scheduled benefits through 2084. So something needs to change between now and 2037 -- whether it's raising the retirement age, altering benefits, or something else -- to keep Social Security solvent. Rubio on the retirement age Rubio has suggested that one solution is to gradually raise the retirement age. Speaking to reporters in Tallahassee on Jan. 27, 2010, Rubio said the "retirement age issue is going to have to be confronted at some point as part of a measure to reform Social Security." Rubio talked about raising the retirement age in a Wall Street Journal interview published March 13, 2010. "I know . . . people don't like to talk about it," the article quotes Rubio as saying. "Privatization of the accounts has come and gone, (but) there are other alternatives, such as [raising] the retirement age, how you adjust payments in the future, 'need' measures, et cetera." And then the retirement age came up again during a March 28 Fox News Sunday debate with a then-Republican Crist. Host Chris Wallace asked Rubio if he would raise the retirement age. "I think that has to be on the table. That's got to be part of the solution. The retirement age that gradually increases for people of my generation, I think has got to be part of ...," Rubio says before getting cut off. He has reiterated that position throughout the campaign, with one important caveat -- there would be no changes for people nearing or now retired. "I think if you're 55 years of age or older or close enough to retirement ... I think this is off the table," Rubio said in the Fox interview. In the Wall Street Journal interview, he said any retirement age changes wouldn't affect people within 10 years of retirement. Rubio on benefit cuts Rubio also suggested changes in the cost-of-living adjustments Social Security beneficiaries receive. In the March Fox News debate, Rubio was asked if he would change cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security. "I think all of that has to be on the table, including the way we index increases in cost of living. All of these issues have to be on the table," Rubio said. "They have to be options that I would be open to." Rubio said as much again on Sept. 26, 2010, in an interview on CBS's Face the Nation. "Younger workers like myself, people 39 years of age like I am -- we're going to have to accept that there's going to be some changes to Social Security," Rubio said. "And perhaps they're going to have to change the way the benefit is indexed. Perhaps we're going to have to continue to allow the retirement age to fluctuate, as it has been doing since the early 1980s. "But again, that's for younger workers like myself who have 20 or 30 years to prepare for this. People that are on the system now, or let's say 10 years from retirement or 12 years from retirement, these folks can't all of a sudden make a change to adjust for it. So I think we have to start talking honestly about the long-term challenges facing a very important program, Social Security, because we want to save it. It's important. We want to preserve it." That full quote probably best explains Rubio's position, in his own words. He supports what amounts to benefit cuts and raising the retirement age, in order to keep Social Security solvent, but not for current retirees or folks nearing retirement. His point is that without changes, Social Security won't be able to meet its obligations. And on that point he's right (not that Crist is going to admit it). Rubio's stance has won him praise from the editorial board of the St. Petersburg Times, which said his position included "the sorts of straight answers Floridians deserve from serious candidates," and conservative commentator George Will, who said, "Rubio's responsible answer to a serious question gives the nation a glimpse of a rarity -- a brave approach to the welfare state's inevitable politics of gerontocracy." What the Rubio folks are all bothered about Crist's ad claims that Rubio "wants to raise the Social Security retirement age" and "cut benefits." Rubio, in his own words, says as much. So what has the Rubio campaign all angry? First, the ad fails to mention the caveat in Rubio's thinking -- that any adjustments to Social Security, whether to the retirement age or benefits, would not affect either current retirees or people nearing retirement. That, and the images that go with the ad. The ad includes images of white-haired and wrinkled-faced retirees that goes along with the narrator's script. When the ad cuts to Charlie Crist, it shows him talking and shaking hands with seniors. "Crist knows that Rubio has pledged to protect and preserve Social Security for those who are at or near retirement," Rubio's campaign said in their press release. Crist spokesman Danny Kanner responded: "In an ad about Social Security, I don't think it's irrelevant to include images of senior citizens." We should note that the ad also says that Rubio wants to "balance the budget on the backs of seniors." That's not true. The changes to Social Security Rubio supports are to make the Social Security program solvent long term, not to create extra tax revenues to use to balance the budget, fund other federal programs or to pay down the federal debt. Crist's ad, "Protect" is correct in pointing out that Rubio supports proposals to keep Social Security solvent past 2037 by raising the retirement age and potentially reducing benefits. Rubio says changes are necessary or the Social Security program will go broke, a sentiment shared by the trustees who manage the federal program. But the ad fails to mention that Rubio's proposals would not affect any current retirees, or people nearing retirement (Rubio most often has said people within 10 years of reaching the Social Security retirement age). The ad certainly doesn't convey that half of the story. So, we think it's appropriate to rate this claim Half True.	None	Charlie Crist	None	None	None	2010-10-06T17:41:24	2010-10-05	['Marco_Rubio']
pomt-06334	"The unemployment rate among (the) non-college-educated is well into the double digits in America. It's 4 percent or 5 percent for people who have college degrees."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/09/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-unemployment-college-grads-4-5-/	During a Republican presidential debate in Michigan on Nov. 9, 2011, former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania drew a striking contrast between the unemployment rates for Americans with bachelor’s degrees and those without. "The unemployment rate among (the) non-college-educated is well into the double digits in America," he said. "It's 4 percent or 5 percent for people who have college degrees." To check this, we turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official source of employment statistics. (One technical note for economic geeks -- we’re using the 25-and-over age group for our data rather than the 16-and-over age group used to calculate the familiar national unemployment rate. That’s because BLS data doesn’t provide educational attainment breakdowns for age brackets below 25.) Let’s look at the rate for college graduates first, since it’s more readily accessible. In October 2011, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for Americans 25 years and older who had at least a bachelor’s degree was 4.4 percent. That rate was not unusual: In the 32 months since March 2008, the unemployment rate for college-educated Americans has remained within a fairly narrow band, between 4.3 percent and 5.1 percent. So on that claim, Santorum’s on the mark. Judging the other part of his claim -- that "the unemployment rate among (the) non-college-educated is well into the double digits" -- is trickier, because it depends on your definition of "non-college-educated." We see at least two plausible definitions -- those who have only a high school degree and never attended college at all, and those who attended college but did not earn a degree. Of these two categories, the data for the first is easier to provide, since BLS offers that information directly. The seaonally adjusted unemployment rate for high school graduates without any college experience and who are 25 years and older was 9.6 percent in October. The highest that number climbed since the onset of the most recent recession was 11.2 percent, in October 2009. Shifting to those who graduated high school and attended college but did not graduate, the numbers have to be extrapolated. So we did that and found that for this group, the unemployment rate was 9.7 percent in October 2011. In other words, not only are both measures virtually identical, but they are also not -- as Santorum said -- "well into the double digits." Nor, during the period we looked at, were they ever well into the double digits for Americans with a high school diploma. To find an unemployment rate for 25-and-overs that can be described as "well into the double digits," you have to get an even less-well-educated pool -- those without a high school degree. For high school dropouts 25 and over, the unemployment rate was 13.8 percent in October 2011. Our ruling Santorum was correct when he said that the unemployment rate is 4 percent or 5 percent for college graduates; it’s currently 4.4 percent. But he overstated his case when he said that "the unemployment rate among (the) non-college-educated is well into the double digits in America." While relatively high by historical standards, the actual numbers today are not in the double digits, much less well into them. On balance, we rate Santorum’s statement Half True. UPDATE: After this item appeared, a number of readers asked us to clarify the unemployment rates for people at various educational achievement levels, so we'll provide more detail here. If you take all people except those with a bachelor's degree -- that is, the sum of high school dropouts, those with only a high school diploma, those with some college but no bachelor's degree, and those with an associate's degree -- the unemployment rate was 9.6 percent. Alternately, if you take people without any college experience -- that is, the sum of high school dropouts and those with only a high school diploma -- the unemployment rate was 10.6 percent. Since neither group was "well into the double digits," as Santorum said, we see no reason to change our ruling.	None	Rick Santorum	None	None	None	2011-11-09T23:07:10	2011-11-09	['United_States']
pomt-04432	"By voting to approve [Question 1], we can . . . save 900 jobs" at Twin River.	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/oct/14/coalition-bring-jobs-ri/twin-river-linked-organization-says-approval-table/	Once again, the state's two slot parlors are rolling the dice in hopes that Rhode Islanders -- along with residents of Lincoln and Newport, where the facilities are located -- will approve referenda permitting the table games that will make them full-fledged casinos. While recent polls show support for the measure, it's anything but a sure bet, and the businesses are spending millions to win support for the measure. One commercial in support of Question 1 is sponsored by Coalition to Bring Jobs to R.I., a 501(c)4 nonprofit "social welfare" organization created by officials at Twin River, in Lincoln, the larger of the two facilities. It features an East Providence woman who talks about the problems of the Rhode Island economy and tells viewers: "By voting to approve, we can keep revenue right here, save 900 jobs and help create 650 new ones." The ad makes no mention of the Newport facility, Newport Grand. We were interested in checking whether defeat of Question 1 would really result in the loss of 900 existing jobs at Twin River. (A comparable proposal, Question 2, would allow table games at Newport Grand.) Twin River and Newport Grand want to add table games to remain competitive with the three casinos and one "racino" expected to be created in Massachusetts in the next several years. The fear is that, without the table games, customers will flock to the Bay State instead. The stakes are huge for the Rhode Island state budget: the two businesses accounted for $321 million of revenue in the budget year that ended June 30, 2012 -- about 10 percent of all revenue. So will 900 jobs be lost if Question 1 is rejected? Only if Twin River shuts down completely. It turns out that 900 is roughly the number of workers that Twin River says it employs now. If the referendum is rejected, Twin River will continue operating. In the short term, the first Massachusetts casino is not expected to open its doors for a few years. And even with the Bay State casinos up and running, Twin River can be profitable, said Clyde Barrow, director of the Center for Policy Analysis at UMass Dartmouth and an expert on gambling in the region. The assumption in the ad is that if voters don't authorize table games Twin River will close, Barrow said. "I don't think that's the case. It's true that once the slot parlor casinos are open in Massachusetts, they do stand to lose as much as 50 percent of their net terminal income," which was $463 million in 2011. "Even if Twin River went to a $225-million-a-year operation, that's still a pretty substantial facility," said Barrow. "It's larger than some of the casinos in Atlantic City. So it will definitely have the capacity to still be profitable at a smaller level of operation." "They would certainly have to lay some people off," said Barrow, "But it wouldn't be the full 900." We also checked a report commissioned by Gov. Lincoln Chafee that included projections of employment at Twin River with and without table games under various scenarios. In the worst-case scenario, where at least one Massachusetts casino is built near Rhode Island, Twin River would have 397 fewer jobs in 2017 than in 2011 if table games aren't permitted. With table games, the loss would be cut to 118 jobs. But that's just the worst scenario. The report says the likeliest outcome is that 319 jobs would be lost if table games were not allowed, and 201 jobs would be gained if Question 1 were to be passed. Under any scenario, that's not close to 900 jobs. When we contacted Twin River, spokeswoman Patti Doyle said that if there are no table games in Rhode Island, Twin River expects to lose 25 percent to 35 percent of its gambling revenue when Massachusetts casinos open. Twin River expects the competition to be on line by late 2016 or early 2017. "A gaming revenue decline at Mohegan Sun and Atlantic City brought nearly a parallel reduction in work force," she said. "So, it's safe to assume that a loss of revenue of 25 percent would translate into a 25 percent loss of our workforce." A 25 percent to 35 percent reduction would result in cuts of 225 to 315 jobs, not 900. Nonetheless, Doyle says Twin River isn't suggesting that the gambling complex might have to close its doors. "That's not what the ads are saying, nor are we saying that now," she wrote in an e-mail. "We can say with certainty with table game approval, none of the existing 900 jobs will be lost." But that's not what the ad says, nor how most people will perceive it. Our Ruling The Coalition to Bring Jobs to R.I., an organization pushing for approval of a referendum question to permit table games at Twin River, says that passage would save 900 jobs in Rhode Island. But the only way 900 jobs would be lost at Twin River would be if it closed, and nobody -- including Twin River -- is saying that's going to happen. Even if Twin River had to scale back its operation by 25 percent to 35 percent, that's not close to the 900 positions that Jobs to R.I. says are at risk. Because the company -- based on its own estimates -- is overplaying its hand, offering a statement that contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-04101	Says in "our region," 2011 was worst drought year ever recorded.	true	/texas/statements/2013/jan/15/kirk-watson/kirk-watson-says-our-region-2011-was-worst-drought/	Two state senators urged the Lower Colorado River Authority to dispense water carefully in an opinion piece in the Austin American-Statesman on Dec. 31, 2012. "Our region is facing an emergency situation with the ongoing and ever-worsening drought: 2011 was the most severe year of drought ever recorded," wrote Sens. Kirk Watson and Troy Fraser. Statewide, 2011 was a record year -- specifically "the worst single-year drought on record," according to a March 23, 2012, Statesman news story. In a Dec. 31, 2011, wrapup of the year’s biggest local news stories, Statesman editors put the drought at No. 2: Crops wilted, lake levels dropped, lawns turned brown, and wildlife went thirsty as Texas endured record drought. At one point in October, 88 percent of the state was deemed to be in exceptional drought, the most severe level. Austin received just less than 15 inches of rain, about half of its normal precipitation, and sweated through a record 90 days of triple-digit temperatures." So not all areas suffered to the same degree. Was the drought as harsh here as elsewhere? First, we checked to make sure what region the senators meant. Watson spokesman Steve Scheibal told us by email that it would be fair to say they meant counties in the river authority's jurisdiction in and around the Austin area (Watson’s District 14 takes in Bastrop County and most of Travis County) and upriver in Fraser’s District 24. We figured that’s probably about the impression Statesman readers got from the words "our region," given that the context was senators discussing the river authority. So we based our fact-finding on Travis, Williamson, Hays and Bastrop counties around Austin, plus Burnet, Blanco, Lampasas, Gillespie, Llano, San Saba and Brown counties upstream. We looked at 11 counties. Click to view larger map Scheibal sent us links to 2011-12 newsletters and reports from the river authority and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality that described record-setting drought across Texas and dry months in the Lower Colorado river basin. To get a closer look, we spoke via phone and email with state climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon, an atmospheric science professor at Texas A&M University. Drought, he told us, can be defined by factors including lack of rainfall, length of time and impact on people and crops. Factoring in duration, for example, the most severe Texas drought remains the 1950-1957 drought, which an Aug. 14, 2011, Statesman news story said "reshaped Texas, ruining thousands of farmers and ranchers and pushing rural residents to migrate out of the country and into the cities." That was the worst extended drought since reliable state records began in the 1890s, though a 2011 study of Texas cypress tree rings showed several longer, harsher droughts over the past 500 years. To help us judge the "most severe year of drought" in the 11-county region, Nielsen-Gammon checked rainfall data recorded there for each "water year" back to 1893. Water years run from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30, he said, beginning with the period when most rainfall accumulates and ending after peak water use. The key is "how much water you end up with at the end of the summer," he said. In rainfall, Nielsen-Gammon told us, 2011 was the second-worst "water year" (Oct. 1 to Sept. 30) in those 11 counties since 1893. The lowest rainfall came in 1956. But the drought was more severe in 2011, he said, because summer temperatures averaged 2 to 3 degrees Fahrenheit above those of 1956, "increasing the need for water by plants while simultaneously evaporating water from reservoirs." So, according to Nielsen-Gammon, the 2011 water year was the worst 12-month drought ever recorded in the 11-county region. The 2011 calendar year would also have been the worst recorded, he said, measured by the river authority’s records of water flowing into the Highland Lakes: Buchanan, Inks, LBJ, Marble Falls, Travis and Austin, of which lakes Buchanan and Travis are reservoirs supplying water customers. According to a Jan. 8, 2013, river authority report sent us by Scheibal, 2011 saw the lowest-ever recorded water flow (from creeks and other tributaries) into the Highland Lakes. We confirmed that with river authority spokeswoman Clara Tuma, who told us its records began in 1942, after the construction of Mansfield Dam created Lake Travis. Nielsen-Gammon told us that although it would take "some sort of major rain" to get the river authority’s water levels back up to normal, the rainfall picture for 2012 was better overall, with precipitation near or above normal levels. Forecasts for 2013 are a still a toss-up, both he and Tuma said. The river authority posted an update Jan. 9, 2012, with data and an interactive map from the National Drought Mitigation Service showing the region still in "Severe Drought." Our ruling Watson said 2011 was the worst drought year in "our region." In records dating to 1893 for the general area indicated, 2011 was the most severe single-year drought by rainfall combined with evaporation, and it also saw the lowest recorded water-flow into the Highland Lakes. Watson’s statement is True.	None	Kirk Watson	None	None	None	2013-01-15T13:40:38	2012-12-31	['None']
pomt-08576	Says Rand Paul thinks drug-dealing, theft, burglary and prostitution should be decriminalized.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/27/jack-conway/jack-conway-campaign-ad-accuses-rand-paul-being-so/	Accusing your opponent of being soft on crime is pretty standard campaign fare, but Kentucky Democrat Jack Conway -- a candidate for U.S. Senate -- takes things one step further in a campaign video, using a two-year-old quote from Republican opponent Rand Paul to suggest Paul wants to decriminalize everything from drug dealing and burglary to prostitution. The ad begins with a clip of the Paul quote in question: "The things that are non-violent shouldn't be against the law." It then cuts to an image of Bernie Madoff with the question, "Should Wall Street Fraudster Bernie Madoff not be in jail?" A uniformed law enforcement officer then asks, "What about meth and drug dealers?" Cut to another officer..."theft, burglary...promoting prostitution..." And then back to Paul saying, "The things that are non-violent shouldn't be against the law." Another version of the Conway ad follows the same theme. "Thinks non-violent crime should be against the law? That's crazy," one uniformed officer says. "It should be a crime if you sells drugs to a minor," says another cop. Then others..."...Wall Street fraud. Mortgage fraud...burglary...someone that's promoting prostitution...theft." The implication is clear: Paul wants to legalize all non-violent crime, including drug dealing, theft, burglary and prostitution. On the campaign trail, Paul has repeatedly denounced the ad, and his campaign promptly put out a press release boasting that a number of county sheriffs had publicly declared their support for his campaign. "I think it's a dishonest ad, would be the first thing I'd say," Paul said in a Sept. 16, 2010, interview on Fox41 in Kentucky. "What we were discussing a couple years ago on KET was whether or not things like motorcycle helmets and the lottery should be illegal because they’re immoral or because they're unsafe. And my point was that there are certain things adults can make decisions on. "What that ad does is, he totally distorts it and wants to say I want to allow minors to use drugs, it is an absolute falsehood." Paul went even further in a Fox News interview on Sept. 19, 2010, calling the ad "a lie." Paul again explained that he was a pundit panelist on a program called Kentucky Tonight on Nov. 24, 2008, and that the context of the discussion was not crime at all, but rather was "about helmet laws for adults and whether adults should have the right to either gamble or buy lottery tickets. And the comparison between lottery tickets and gambling. And it really had nothing to do with drugs or drugs for minors, or all these things, prostitution..." "So," the interviewer interjected, "you think those things should be illegal, Dr. Paul?" "Yes," Paul said. "And I'm not proposing any changes in the drug laws or laws against prostitution." We listened to the entirety of the Kentucky Tonight program on the night in question, and Paul is correct that the focus was on whether the state ought to place higher taxes on things like cigarettes or alcohol. Paul made it clear he didn't think that was the government's place. "Do we want our tax commissioner to be the moral commissioner of sin?" Paul said on the program. "Where does it stop?" Paul said, throwing out the example of whether the government ought to put an extra $1 tax on a McDonald's quarter pounder to help curb obesity. "It really isn't our job to tell people whether they should smoke or not," Paul said. "It's not our job to tell people whether they should eat too much or not. We're a free society where individuals can decide what they want to decide." In the course of the discussion, Paul talked about whether the government should regulate whether someone should be able to ride a bike or motorcycle without a helmet. And what about gambling? he asked, noting that, "It's OK to gamble on the lottery, just not slot machines." "I'm against legislating morality," Paul said. "I mean, I'm for crimes and having laws against things that are violent crimes. But things that are non-violent shouldn't be against the law." So there's the fuller context. John Collins, a spokesman for the Conway campaign, said Paul's words speak for themselves. "Rand Paul believes drugs aren't a pressing issue and that non-violent crimes, such as prostitution and selling drugs, shouldn’t be against the law," Collins said. "If Paul thinks that’s misleading, then he should not have said it. Simply put, you could hold a meeting of all the people who agree with Rand Paul’s soft on crime beliefs in a phone booth." We asked Collins for evidence to support the claim that Paul believes selling drugs, for example, shouldn't be against the law. He pointed us to a series of quotes in which Paul espouses the opinion that issues of crime are better addressed at the state and local, rather than federal, government level. So, for example, he has said that issues like whether to legalize medical marijuana ought to be decided by states, and that the funding for drug enforcement ought to come from state and local governments. Those may be controversial positions, but they are a far cry from Paul saying he believes that drug dealing and burglary ought not to be against the law. We asked Collins if he could point us toward any other quotes from Paul that suggest he doesn't think drug dealing, burglary and prostitution, for example, should not be against the law. He referred us only to Paul's two-year-old quote, "The things that are non-violent shouldn't be against the law." Certainly Paul could have chosen his words more carefully. But this strikes us as more of a political "gotcha" than a legitimate issue. The quote comes in the context of Paul discussing the propriety of government involvement in issues such as cigarette or alcohol taxes, gambling and wearing a motorcycle helmet. Paul said what he said. But for the Conway campaign to splice that with comments from law enforcement officials listing non-violent crime such as dealing drugs to kids, promoting prostitution, theft, burglary and financial crime suggests Paul wants to decriminalize those acts. We couldn't find a single instance where Paul has said he specifically wanted to legalize any of those activities. Conversely, Paul has repeatedly and unequivocally said he does not want to make those things legal, and that he has no plans to change the current laws with regard to them. We think a reasonable person can see what's going on here. We rate this ad False.	None	Jack Conway	None	None	None	2010-09-27T12:13:35	2010-09-14	['None']
pomt-07836	Orrin Hatch co-sponsored a 1993 health care bill that had an individual mandate.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/14/cenk-uygur/hatch-once-supported-individual-mandate-said-cenk-/	With Keith Olbermann's recent departure from MSNBC, the cable news channel has re-shuffled its liberal talk show hosts and added a new pundit, Cenk Uygur (pronounced Jenk You-grr). Uygur recently ripped Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, for courting the tea party movement. First, Uygur showed video of Hatch saying that he, like the tea party, was opposed to the health care law. "I was the one who raised the issue about the job-killing employer mandate, and of course the unconstitutional employee mandate," Hatch said. "I've been all over the world for our country. Everywhere we go, people have always been amazed by America. And yet, we're in danger of losing the greatest country in the world. So we've got to fight back." "Here's what I'm amazed by -- Orrin Hatch," Uygur said. "You're going to tell me you're tea party? There's no one who's more Republican establishment than Orrin Hatch, who's been there for approximately 800 years. ... By the way, did you hear him putting dirt on the mandate? He said, oh, I can't put a mandate. I'm totally against that. Did you know that Hatch co-sponsored the 1993 bill that had an individual mandate? ... It's unbelievable." We knew Uygur was joking about Hatch serving in the Senate for 800 years. (Hatch was elected in 1976, not 1210.) But we were interested in Uygur's comment that Hatch had once sponsored a health care bill that included an individual mandate. We wondered if that were actually the case, so we decided to check it out. Our search took us back to the health care debates of the early 1990s, when President Bill Clinton tried to shepherd through a national health care plan with help from First Lady Hillary Clinton. The Clinton plan required employers to pay for insurance and then closely regulated both insurers and health care providers through cost controls and purchasing groups. To counter that, the late Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., introduced a plan that avoided the employer mandate and cost controls. Chafee's plan, one of several Republican alternatives, created a universal tax deduction for health insurance and gave the poor vouchers to buy policies. It also required everyone to buy insurance -- an individual mandate. Chafee's plan was backed by a group of Republican senators, including Hatch, according to news reports from the time. When the plan was formally introduced as legislation, Hatch was one of the co-sponsors. Two other current senators also co-sponsored the plan: Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind. We examined the old legislation, which we found in the THOMAS legislative database. The individual mandate in that proposal appears to work the same as the mandate in the new law. The main difference is how the fines work for those who don't buy insurance. The new law sets a dollar amount; the older proposal set the fee at 120 percent of average premium limits, as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. We contacted Hatch's office to ask for an explanation for Hatch's change of position, but we didn't hear back. Last year, Kaiser Health News interviewed former Sen. Dave Durenberger, R-Minn., who had also co-sponsored the plan. Durenberger said that it was Republicans who had changed in the years since 1993, backing away from policies on health care they once supported. Uygur asked, "Did you know that Hatch co-sponsored the 1993 bill that had an individual mandate?" We didn't, but we checked the record. Hatch was the co-sponsor of a Republican-backed bill that included an individual mandate. We rate Uygur's statement True.	None	Cenk Uygur	None	None	None	2011-02-14T15:40:07	2011-02-09	['None']
pomt-02802	"Since 1988, Congress has raised its own salary 15 times 'to reflect rising costs.' But raised the minimum wage only three times."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2013/dec/02/facebook-posts/facebook-group-says-congress-has-raised-minimum-wa/	The idea of raising the federal minimum wage from $7.25 per hour is becoming a hot button issue. Supporters say that wage is so low it forces the working poor to seek out food stamps to survive, adding to the burden of taxpayers and subsidizing the profits of low-paying companies such as Walmart and McDonalds. Critics say that raising the minimum wage kills jobs, makes it harder for companies to hire new workers, and adds to the costs of goods and services for everyone. (Nineteen states have their own minimum wage laws that exceed the federal base. Among them is Rhode Island, where the minimum wage, now $7.75, goes to $8 on Jan. 1.) Raise the Minimum Wage, a Facebook group that wants Congress to pass an $11 minimum wage, is criticizing Congress, claiming it’s quick to give itself pay increases but slow to raise the minimum wage. It posted a picture of the Internet's well-known "Grumpy Cat" accompanied by this message: "Since 1988, Congress has raised its own salary 15 times 'to reflect rising costs.' But raised the minimum wage only three times." It has been shared more than 8,800 times. We wondered whether the data are correct. To count the number of minimum wage increases since 1988, we turned to the Wage and Hour Division of the U.S. Department of Labor. Its handy chart shows that in 1981, Congress had set the minimum wage at $3.35 per hour, where it remained until April 1, 1990, when it rose to $3.80. Since then, there have been six additional increases. That's seven in all, not three as the Facebook post asserts. And how often has Congressional pay increased? For that data, we turned to a Nov. 4, 2013 report by the Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan think tank for Congress, which tracked pay going back to 1789. In 1988, members of Congress earned $89,500 per year. The following year, Congress passed a law establishing automatic pay increases for itself unless the House and Senate specifically voted to forego raises, which it has done repeatedly. The law was amended in 1991. Since then, members of the House have seen their annual pay increase 14 times. The Senate has received 15 increases, which is the number the Facebook post got correct. Members of both bodies now receive $174,000 per year, with leaders receiving additional pay. So where did Raise the Minimum Wage get the idea that there have only been three minimum wage increases? It comes from that fact that the seven increases were the result of three Congressional votes, in 1989, 1996 and 2007. By that standard, Congress has only voted twice to increase its pay, although those votes produced 15 pay hikes. One commenter on the Facebook page said, "The minimum wage should be increased by the same percent each time Congress gets a pay raise." In fact, the minimum wage is now 116 percent higher than it was in 1988. By contrast, the pay for members of Congress has increased by 94 percent and inflation has increased by 97 percent. Our ruling A posting by the Facebook group Raise the Minimum Wage said, "Since 1988, Congress has raised its own salary 15 times 'to reflect rising costs.' But raised the minimum wage only three times." Although Congress has scored 15 pay increases thanks to the automatic formula it adopted in 1989, it has also approved seven increases in the minimum wage during that period, not three. Because the posting ignores more than half the minimum wage increases since 1988 while giving the false impression that Congress has actively voted itself raises 15 times, we rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-11619	Says "22 to 24 people" came into the United States due to family connection with suspect in the October 2017 New York City terror attack.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/24/donald-trump/donald-trumps-unsubstantiated-claims-about-chain-m/	President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that more than 20 people have migrated to the United States due to family ties to a terror attack suspect. A man drove a truck onto a bike lane and pedestrian walkway in Manhattan on Oct. 31, killing eight people and injuring 12 others. The suspect, Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov, is an Uzbek national whom Trump has singled out as a reason why "chain migration" and a visa lottery program should end. "This man that came in — or whatever you want to call him — brought in, with him, other people … He was the point of contact — the primary point of contact for — and this is preliminarily — 23 people that came in, or potentially came in with him. And that’s not acceptable. So we want to get rid of chain migration, and we’ve wanted to do that for a long time," Trump said Nov. 1. Trump offered a lower number as he discussed the terror suspect with the Wall Street Journal on Jan. 11: "So the lottery has to end, chain migration — he brought in, they say, 22 people through the chain. So we have 22 of his relatives, why?" Two days earlier during a meeting on immigration with bipartisan lawmakers, Trump said it was "22 to 24 people came in through him." We wondered if Trump was right: have at least 22 people come to the United States due to familial links to Saipov? Neither the White House nor the Department of Homeland Security provided information to substantiate Trump’s claims. A State Department spokesperson told us that visa records are confidential under immigration law, preventing comment on the details of individual visa cases. Experts told us Trump’s figures are improbable. Green card holders have limits on family sponsorship Saipov, from Uzbekistan, entered the United States in 2010 through the diversity visa lottery program, which admits up to 50,000 people per year from countries with low levels of immigration to the United States. Applicants for the diversity program are able to include in their application their spouse and unmarried children under 21 years old. That is not what happened with Saipov, who arrived in 2010. Multiple news outlets reported that Saipov got married in the United States in 2013 to a woman who already lived here, also an Uzbek national. Their three children were all born in the United States. The family lived in Paterson, N.J. "Unless Saipov had 22 unmarried, under-age-21 children at the time he came here, President Trump's statement that Saipov brought 22 people with him is clearly false," said Stephen H. Legomsky, an emeritus professor at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis who served as chief counsel of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services from 2011 to 2013. Once in the United States, green card holders, such as Saipov, are only able to petition their spouse and unmarried children. We have not seen any reports of 29-year-old Saipov fathering more than 20 kids before he left Uzbekistan and petitioning for them to come to the United States since his arrival. Generally, is it possible for one green card holder to bring in 22 or more relatives? "It may be possible, but it’s very unlikely," said Julia Gelatt, a senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute working with the U.S. Immigration Policy Program. "Theoretically, if someone had many foreign-born children, and those children had many children, they could sponsor one spouse, plus 21 children and grandchildren. The grandchildren would come as derivatives of their children." But that would be far above the average rate of family sponsorship, Gelatt said. A 2013 study found that overall, each new immigrant sponsored an average of 3.45 family members. As the New York Times and Washington Post’s Fact Checker have noted, if Saipov were a U.S. citizen (he's not) he could have petitioned his parents and three sisters to join him. There's no waiting period for parents, but brothers and sisters of adult U.S. citizens fall under a "fourth-preference" immigration category. As of Nov. 1, 2017, there were 2.3 million people in that category waiting for a visa, with a waiting period of over 13 years. The categories of family members that can be petitioned for admission are greater for U.S. citizens, who can additionally bring in parents, siblings, and married sons and daughters and their spouses and children. U.S. citizens can also petition a fiance(e) to come on a visa, and eventually file for a green card after marriage. Another immigrant accused of a separate attack, Akayed Ullah, "benefited from extended family chain migration" when he came to the United States from Bangladesh in 2011, DHS said. Ullah, accused of setting of a pipe bomb inside a New York City subway terminal, is also a green card holder. The department did not describe Saipov as having "extended family chain migration." Our ruling Trump said that "22 to 24 people" came into the United States due to family connection with the suspect in the October 2017 New York City terror attack. The Trump administration did not provide any information to support this repeated claim about Saipov. Green card holders, such as Saipov, can only petition for a spouse and unmarried children to come to the United States. Media reports indicate that Saipov married a woman who already lived in the United States and that their three children were born in the United States. Saipov could not have petitioned parents or siblings in his current immigration status. Without evidence to support it, we rate Trump's claim False.

pomt-03975	Says he was the first local official to endorse Barack Obama	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2013/feb/13/ed-fitzgerald/ed-fitzgerald-says-he-was-early-obama-supporter-cu/	First impressions mean a lot in politics. And for Cuyahoga County Executive Ed FitzGerald, who is gearing up for a run at Ohio Gov. John Kasich next year, they are especially important. A Democrat who previously served as mayor of Lakewood, FitzGerald is not well-known beyond Greater Cleveland. He has been traveling the state for nearly a year in an effort to build relationships with party activists who can help make him a credible candidate. The effort intensified last month when ex-Gov. Ted Strickland, a fellow Democrat, said he would not seek a rematch with Kasich, a Republican. FitzGerald has been the most active in a group of potential challengers that also includes U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan and former Rep. Betty Sutton. While speaking last month at the Ohio College Democrats’ winter conference in Cincinnati, FitzGerald mixed his dry humor with political biography. He presented himself as a reformer -- a theme familiar to local voters who elected him to lead them past a corruption scandal. The boast that caught our eye was one reported by the Cincinnati Enquirer: "He proudly said that he was the first Cuyahoga County official to endorse President Barack Obama." PolitiFact Ohio found the line interesting and wanted more context. We reached out to the Ohio Republican Party, which sends trackers to capture FitzGerald’s public remarks on video. (FitzGerald frequently jokes that the trackers’ jobs are the only ones Kasich can take credit for creating, but we’ll set that claim aside as political hyperbole.) Video provided by the GOP shows FitzGerald made the claim about his Obama endorsement toward the end of a 20-minute speech. While praising the young crowd for its engagement, he drew inspiration from Obama. He recognized Ohio Senate Minority Leader Eric Kearney, who spoke before him, and noted that Kearney was an early supporter of Obama’s 2008 campaign. Then FitzGerald continued: "I was the first elected official in Cuyahoga County to endorse him." Cuyahoga County has nearly 60 municipalities, each with its own set of elected leaders. Obama began his campaign for the presidency in early 2007. At the time, FitzGerald was a city councilman and mayoral aspirant in Lakewood, Cleveland’s second-largest suburb. FitzGerald won his race for mayor that year and was in office by the time the 2008 primary season began. A search of Plain Dealer archives revealed then-County Commissioner Peter Lawson Jones as one of Obama’s key local supporters in early 2007. Jones was one of several local officials to attend an Obama’s first Northeast Ohio event Feb. 27, an East Side rally less than three weeks after Obama officially entered the race for the White House.The newspaper’s first mention of FitzGerald as an Obama backer came Jan. 31, 2008, when he represented him at a Lakewood straw poll. Obama beat Hillary Rodham Clinton by a 2-to-1 margin, according to the story. We reached out to Jones, now pursuing an acting career. "I don’t know how he calculates that he was the first," said Jones, who could not remember when he formally endorsed Obama. "I think that’s incapable of being proven or disproven. How did this manifest itself? He would have had to have gotten up pretty early to beat me to it." When reached by PolitiFact Ohio, FitzGerald said he pledged his support the day Obama declared himself a candidate for president, Feb. 10, 2007. But he added that there probably was no record of the endorsement because he offered it through an Obama campaign web site. "He might have beaten me to the web site," Jones allowed. FitzGerald accurately recalled that Obama began his campaign as an underdog. Clinton was the early favorite for the Democratic nomination. But FitzGerald also acknowledged that he hardly was a heavy-hitter at the time. Even in its infancy the Obama campaign was enough of a force that it didn’t have to worry about telling the world about a city councilman’s endorsement. "No one cared about it then," FitzGerald said. But now it’s a handy tidbit as the county executive contemplates a run for governor. FitzGerald told PolitiFact Ohio that he couldn’t remember why he shared it with the College Democrats, other than to emphasize the importance of getting involved early in a cause you believe in. According to the Ohio GOP video, here’s what he said after claiming first dibs on Obama: "There’s a lot of great things that President Obama has done. One of the great things that he’s done is that he has empowered young activists more than any other presidential candidate that I have seen — and, I would argue, ever — since Robert Kennedy." FitzGerald, though, clearly said he was the "first elected official in Cuyahoga County to endorse" Obama. To endorse is to "approve openly" or "to express support or approval of publicly and definitely," according to the most applicable definition offered by Merriam-Webster. We don’t doubt that FitzGerald was one of the first local supporters of the future president. His work in the straw poll, at a time that many were still in Clinton’s corner, confirms that. But FitzGerald’s initial backing, offered quietly online and by his own acknowledgement tough to verify, doesn’t equal an endorsement in the most accurate sense of the word. FitzGerald is correct that his support wasn’t a big deal at the time. So even if he was the first or, more precisely, one of the first, he might have overstated the importance of his endorsement. And Jones rightly questions whether it can be proven who, technically, was the first. FitzGerald is unable to offer proof. The gubernatorial prospect’s statement has an element of truth, but leaves out critical information that would give a different impression. On the Truth-O-Meter, FitzGerald’s claim merits a rating of Mostly False.	None	Ed FitzGerald	None	None	None	2013-02-13T14:52:14	2013-01-26	['None']
pomt-15253	Says Donald Trump is for a single-payer health care system.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/02/rick-perry/donald-trump-still-single-payer-health-care/	For all his success firing up the GOP base, Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump may be a Republican in name only when it comes to health care, says former Texas Gov. Rick Perry. Perry -- at 11th place in the polls and currently just shy of making it into the first Republican debate Aug. 6 -- has been trading jabs with Trump for weeks. Trump mocked Perry’s glasses in July, and Perry responded by calling Trump "a cancer on conservatism" and challenging him to a pull-up contest. Perry switched up his attacks from the physical to the political on Aug. 2’s Fox News Sunday. "He's for single payer," Perry said. "How can anyone who's a conservative stand up and say I am for single-payer health care?" Perry’s campaign referred us to a Buzzfeed piece and a PunditFact article that noted Trump’s past support for a Canadian-style, single-payer plan. Perry’s claim goes further to suggest Trump, like Vermont socialist and Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, currently supports a single-payer system, which is a specific type of universal health care in which the government foots the bill for all residents. We wanted to know if Trump still supports that model. Trump’s campaign did not respond to our inquiry, and his campaign website does not outline any of his positions on major issues, including health care. So we scoured transcripts and videos from Trump’s public statements and interviews. Trump has been a vocal opponent of the Affordable Care Act, but his general stance on health care is much murkier. On the medical record Trump has said multiple times that he would "get rid of Obamacare" as soon as he takes office. He’s also repeatedly attacked the Healthcare.gov website as a $5 billion failure that "has never worked" (which rates False). But disliking the Affordable Care Act, which is not a single-payer system, is not the same thing as condemning the concept of health care for all. During his short-lived flirtation with a 2000 Reform Party presidential bid, Trump supported universal health care without ambiguity, and he voiced support for a single-payer system in several instances. • "If you can’t take care of your sick in the country, forget it, it’s all over. ... I believe in universal healthcare," Trump told CNN’s Larry King in October 1999. • "I would put forth a comprehensive health care program and fund it with an increase in corporate taxes, " Trump told The Advocate right before he dropped out of the race in February 2000. • "The Canadian plan also helps Canadians live longer and healthier than America. … We need, as a nation, to reexamine the single-payer plan, as many individual states are doing," Trump writes in his 2000 book The America We Deserve. Trump has said very little about single-payer health care since 2000, according to our search of the LexisNexis database. Reading between the lines Trump’s more recent comments about health care systems contradict each other, which experts say suggests he hasn’t formed a clear position. While bantering with David Letterman on Jan. 8, 2015, Trump voiced admiration for Scotland’s publically funded health care system and suggested that the problem with the Affordable Care Act is its implementation. Here’s a transcript of their exchange: Letterman, recounting how cheap it is to treat injuries abroad: "In one case, I had my arm reattached and at the end of the procedure ... it was like $12 dollars!" Trump: "A friend of mine was in Scotland recently. He got very, very sick. They took him by ambulance and he was there for four days. He was really in troubl,e and they released him and he said, ‘Where do I pay?’ And they said, ‘There’s no charge.’ Not only that, he said it was like great doctors, great care. I mean we could have a great system in this country." Letterman: "Are people afraid of socialism?" Trump: "Well, people are afraid of a lot of things. But it’s mostly incompetence. … How do you spend $5 billion on a website, just the creation of the site itself, and it doesn’t work? … There are things you could do to give unbelievable healthcare and a much better healthcare system. It’s a complicated topic, unfortunately." Experts told us Trump is either implicitly supporting a single-payer system or putting his foot in his mouth. "The Scottish system is a classic single-payer system, like the English system, except better funded," said Timothy Jost, a professor of health care law at Washington and Lee University. "He should stop citing Scotland," said Gail Wilensky, a health economist and former head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. "He doesn’t seem to know what the Scottish system is. Most market-oriented people are not real keen about it." In a July radio interview, Trump came short of rejecting his previous position for a Canadian-style plan and instead talked about a totally different approach. He called himself a "conservative with a heart" and described his alternative to the Affordable Care Act: "Great (private) plans" made through "deals with hospitals" that allow the government to help people "at the lower levels." On July 31, a spokesperson for Trump clarified to Forbes that he’s "never supported socialized medicine" but is for "a universal ‘market-based’ plan that would offer a range of choices." The sort of system Trump is alluding to — a universal, market-based system with a mix of public and private funding — is essentially what the Affordable Care Act establishes, Jost said. More teased-out conservative alternatives with less government regulation than the Affordable Care Act can be found in John McCain’s 2008 proposal or Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan’s reform bill, Wilensky said. Our ruling Perry said Trump is "for single-payer health care." Fifteen years ago, Trump was decidedly for a universal healthcare system that resembled Canada’s system, in which the government pays for care for all citizens. Recently, he's said he admires Scotland’s single-payer system and disses the Affordable Care Act as incompetently implemented. However, a Trump spokesman denied that the candidate supported "socialized medicine" and suggested Trump prefers a "free-market" solution. Other than that, though, the Trump campaign has been silent about what his specific health care policies are; perhaps Trump will be pressed on this point during the Aug. 6 debate. Given the current evidence, Perry's attack is partially accurate, but leaves out details. We rate the statement Half True.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2015-08-02T17:03:17	2015-08-02	['None']

pomt-13167	Says Marco Rubio "said Social Security and Medicare have ‘weakened us as a people.’ "	mostly true	/florida/statements/2016/oct/27/patrick-murphy/murphy-revisits-rubios-reagan-library-line-about-s/	In the second U.S. Senate debate, U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy accused U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of wanting to "dismantle" Social Security -- a charge Rubio denied in a debate in South Florida -- and offered Rubio's own words as proof. According to Murphy, Rubio "said Social Security and Medicare have, quote, ‘weakened us as a people.' " Rubio said that Murphy distorted his words. "What I said is debt is weakening our country, it absolutely is," Rubio replied in the Oct. 26 debate at Broward College. Murphy was referring to a speech Rubio gave at the Ronald Reagan presidential library in 2011. The quote is accurate, but it did not come in a speech arguing for such drastic reforms to Social Security and Medicare as Murphy described. Rubio’s ‘weakened us as a people’ comment During his speech, Rubio said Democrats and Republicans created programs and levels of spending that -- while well intentioned -- were doomed to fail from the start. "These programs actually weakened us as a people. You see, almost in forever, it was institutions and society that assumed the role of taking care of one another. If someone was sick in your family, you took care of them. If a neighbor met misfortune, you took care of them. You saved for your retirement and your future because you had to. "We took these things upon ourselves and our communities and our families and our homes and our churches and our synagogues. But all that changed when the government began to assume those responsibilities. All of the sudden, for an increasing number of people in our nation, it was no longer necessary to worry about saving for security because that was the government's job. ... "The other thing is that we built a government and its programs without any account whatsoever for how we were going to pay for it. There was not thought given into how this was going to be sustained." A Rubio spokesman pointed us to the section in which Rubio said the programs didn’t take into account future costs. But Rubio did say that such programs "weakened" Americans. Rubio has long called for reforming Social Security and Medicare. In Florida, about 21 percent of Florida’s population -- about 3.9 million people -- receive Social Security benefits. About 4 million Floridians use Medicare for health insurance. The programs accounted for 41 percent of federal program expenditures in fiscal year 2015. The programs face long-term financing shortfalls, leading program trustees and federal budget experts to call for action by Congress. Rubio has said that he favors raising the retirement age for people such as himself in their 40s but not for current retirees or those who will retire soon. "Social Security will go bankrupt, and it will bankrupt the country with it," Rubio said at a March presidential debate in Miami. "So what it will require is people younger, like myself, people that are 30 years away from retirement, to accept that our Social Security is going to work differently than it did for my parents." Does Rubio want to privatize Social Security and turn Medicare into a voucher? Murphy also said that Rubio supported the bill by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., to privatize Social Security and turn Medicare into a voucher. Rubio has supported a "premium support system" that would give seniors a fixed amount of money to purchase insurance from Medicare or a private provider. That was similar to a plan by Ryan. Rubio voted for the Ryan budgets that included reductions in future Medicare spending. The burden would have fallen on beneficiaries to pay more out of pocket. While Rubio was in the Senate, Ryan’s Path to Prosperity budget resolution introduced in 2011 got rid of all mention of potential privatization, choosing instead to focus on overhauling Medicare and cutting taxes and expenditures. His resolution punted on Social Security: "In the event that the Social Security program is not sustainable, the president, in conjunction with the Board of Trustees, must submit a plan for restoring balance to the fund." This would also require the U.S. House and Senate to provide ideas for potential solutions. While running for president in 2015, Rubio wrote an op-ed on Social Security in which he called for raising the retirement age, reducing growth in benefits for wealthy seniors and making it easier to save money -- but he didn’t call for privatization. In his current race, Rubio’s Social Security plan on his website makes no mention of privatization. Our ruling Murphy said that Rubio "said Social Security and Medicare have ‘weakened us as a people,' " he said. In a speech in 2011, Rubio talked about government programs intended to help people and said, "These programs actually weakened us as a people." Rubio argued that people no longer had to worry about saving once they viewed it as the government’s job and that the government supplanted the role of families and religious institutions to help people in need. Rubio also expressed concern that that lawmakers lacked foresight as to how to pay for the programs in the future. The caveat here is that the quote is not evidence of Rubio aiming to dismantle these programs.

pomt-05728	President Obama's "budget would call for about $25 trillion in debt by the end of his term, if he was re-elected."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2012/mar/05/bob-mcdonnell/mcdonnell-says-obama-if-reelected-would-drive-debt/	Gov. Bob McDonnell says the country can’t afford another four years of President Barack Obama. "[The president’s] budget would call for about $25 trillion in debt by the end of his term, if he was re-elected," McDonnell, a Republican, said at Politico’s Feb. 24 State Solutions Conference. The total U.S. debt stands at about $15.5 trillion. About two-thirds of it is owed to investors and the rest is owed to trust funds for government programs such as Social Security and Medicare. McDonnell’s statement caught our eye. If Obama is re-elected, would his policies really lead to a $9.5 trillion expansion of the national debt by the time the president leaves office in January 2017? Tucker Martin, a spokesman for the governor, stressed to us that McDonnell’s statement was made during an hour-long "extemporaneous" exchange over a range of issues. Then he offered a clarification. Martin said in an email that McDonnell had cited a figure on what the debt would be at the end of a 10-year projection contained in the president’s budget for the current 2012 fiscal year. Martin pointed to White House summary tables for that budget estimating it would lead to a total national debt of $26.3 trillion in 2021. The tables essentially assume that policies in the budget will be carried out for a decade. On Feb. 13, more than a week before McDonnell made his statement, the president introduced his budget for fiscal 2013, which starts Oct. 1. The White House projected the plan would lead to gross national debts of $25 trillion in 2021 and $25.9 trillion in 2022. "Under the terms of his introduced budgets, the president, if re-elected, would leave office in January 2017 with the national debt estimated to reach approximately $25 trillion by 2021," Martin said. But that’s not what the governor said. McDonnell said the debt would hit the $25 trillion mark by the end of a hypothetical second Obama term in January 2017. There’s a considerable difference. The president’s current spending proposal projects the debt will grow to $21.3 trillion by the end of fiscal 2017 -- the last year for which a two-term Obama would submit a budget. That’s still a leap from the current debt, but $3.7 trillion below what McDonnell said. To put that number in focus, $3.7 trillion is also the entire amount this year’s federal budget. The sum would roughly cover four years of government spending on Social Security or six years of outlays for defense. Jason Peuquet, research director at the centrist Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said that while 10-year projections are important to budget, they are also extremely volatile. "These things are about 100 percent guaranteed to be not right on the mark," he said. Josh Gordon, policy director at the Concord Coalition -- an organization that advocates balanced budgets -- does not put much stock in measuring debt by simple dollars. Gordon said it’s best to look at it in proportion to the country’s Gross Domestic Product -- the total goods and services produced -- because that compares the debt to a nation’s ability to pay. U.S. total debt is now about 101 percent of GDP. The White House projects it would peak at 107.8 percent of GDP in 2014 under Obama’s budget before dropping to 102.3 percent in 2021. Our ruling McDonnell said that if Obama is reelected this year, his budget policies would push total U.S. debt to about $25 trillion by the time the president’s second term expired in 2017. The governor’s spokesman qualified the statement. McDonnell, he said, cited a White House projection of the national debt in 2021 if Obama’s policies are continued. Indeed, the administration has estimated a $25 trillion debt that year. But in 2017 -- at the end of a second Obama term that McDonnell addressed with dread -- the debt would be $21.3 trillion. That’s still a heavy load, but significantly less then the governor claimed. McDonnell’s statement is based on the element of truth that the debt will continue to rise under Obama’s policies, but greatly exaggerates by how much. We rate his claim Mostly False.

pomt-14560	"My two appointments to the Florida Supreme Court, Raul Cantero and Kenneth Bell, have earned reputations as its most consistent conservatives."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/10/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-his-two-appointments-florida-supreme/	Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush’s positions on some issues, such as immigration, have been to the left of other members of the GOP presidential field. But last month, Bush laid down a marker on his own conservatism: his selection of conservative judges. "I have a proven record of appointing conservatives to the Florida judiciary as governor, and my administration devoted substantial time to vetting nominees," Bush wrote in an article for Medium. "We sought judges who had shown humility, courage, an appreciation of the duties of a judge, a respect for the will of the people, and devotion to full application of the law without equivocation. My two appointments to the Florida Supreme Court, Raul Cantero and Kenneth Bell, have earned reputations as its most consistent conservatives. Additionally, two of the appellate judges I named as governor, Charles Canady and Ricky Polston, are now serving with distinction on the Florida Supreme Court." We wondered whether Bush was right that Cantero and Bell "have earned reputations as its most consistent conservatives." Our research suggests that Bush has a point, though the case is stronger for Bell than for Cantero. Some preliminaries We will note that Bush’s Medium article misspelled Cantero’s first name. It’s actually Raoul. Second, due to a grammatical misfire, what Bush wrote was somewhat misleading. Saying that Bell and Cantero "have earned reputations as (the court’s) most consistent conservatives" suggests that Bell and Cantero continue to serve as justices. That’s not the case -- both left the court to take positions in the private sector in 2008, almost eight years ago. Though Bush can hardly be blamed for their early departures from the court, it does mean that his successor, Charlie Crist, got to nominate their replacements. As it happens, though, their replacements were Canady and Polston -- the two other judges whose appointments Bush takes credit for in the Medium article. About the Florida Supreme Court Though Republicans have long had strong majorities in the Florida Legislature and haven’t lost a gubernatorial race in the state since 1994, the state Supreme Court has been a somewhat surprising bulwark for Democrats in recent years. The last Democratic governor, Lawton Chiles, appointed three of the seven members in 1997 and 1998 -- Barbara Pariente, Fred Lewis and Peggy Quince. Quince’s appointment was complicated; Chiles chose her, but due to the timing of judicial and gubernatorial terms, Bush ended up being the one to officially install her. (Bush’s role in the appointment of Quince -- who’s seen as a liberal -- may muddy his conservative bona fides to some, but the scenario was such an unusual one that we’ll set it aside in this analysis.) The other four justices currently on the court were named by Crist, who was elected as a Republican but later became an independent while in office and ultimately made an unsuccessful run for governor as a Democrat in 2014. Crist’s two picks from the early part of his tenure -- Canady and Polston -- are generally considered to be conservatives. His two later picks, Jorge Labarga and James Perry, are generally considered moderate to liberal. All told, then, under its current makeup, the Florida Supreme Court tends to lean moderate to liberal -- certainly more so than either chamber of the Legislature or the current governor, Republican Rick Scott. In fact, under the current court, 5-2 decisions -- with conservatives Canady and Polston in the minority -- have become rather common. Notably, the court -- with Canady and Polston in dissent -- has taken an aggressive stance on redrawing legislative and congressional districts that had been drawn by Republicans. Bell and Cantero in context We found general agreement that both Bell and Cantero were conservative, though Cantero perhaps less "consistent" than Bell, to use Bush’s word. On the one hand, when Cantero stepped down, the Tampa Bay Times called him "one of the high court’s two most conservative judges." The Associated Press called him "one of its most conservative members." The Ocala Star-Banner called the two justices "reliable conservative voices," noting their dissents in a 5-2 decision in 2006 that overturned a school voucher program supported by Bush. In 1993, Cantero wrote a letter to the editor of the Miami Herald that defended anti-abortion protesters, saying, "Abortions kill children," the Times reported. The Bush campaign also pointed us to a web posting by the Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative legal advocacy group that described Bell and Cantero as "widely regarded as conservative in their judicial philosophies." On the other hand, Cantero had an "unpredictably independent" streak, the Times wrote on his retirement: "He blasted a Bush privatization measure, in which private attorneys with little-to-no criminal law experience were being hired to replace public defenders for death row inmates. Cantero called their performance some of ‘the worst lawyering I've seen.’ " Indeed, the death penalty is probably the issue on which Cantero has deviated most from traditional conservatism. Cantero authored the majority opinion of State of Florida vs. Steele (2005), which ruled that unanimity should be required for jury recommendations of death sentences. Bush expressed openness to the idea, but the Legislature never acted, and hasn’t since. Indeed, from the private sector, Cantero has continued to urge unanimity in death penalty cases, including a 2012 Miami Herald op-ed he co-wrote. Cantero also joined a unanimous decision -- along with Bell -- to overturn a law supported by Bush and the Legislature to reinsert a tube into Terri Schiavo, a brain-damaged patient whose case became a cause celebre, especially for some social conservatives. "It was a proud moment for us that we were able to reach a unanimous decision," Cantero told the Associated Press at the time. "We were able to work through the issues dispassionately." Our ruling Bush said, "My two appointments to the Florida Supreme Court, Raul Cantero and Kenneth Bell, have earned reputations as its most consistent conservatives." Bell and Cantero were certainly the most conservative members of the court when they were serving on it. However, Bush could have phrased his statement more carefully, to avoid suggesting that they are still on the court. Also, Cantero did sometimes break ranks with the traditionally conservative position, such as on the death penalty. The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Jeb Bush	None	None	None	2016-02-10T18:11:38	2016-01-24	['None']
pomt-11036	Says Wisconsin "hadn’t been won by a Republican since Dwight D. Eisenhower, in 1952. And I won Wisconsin. … Ronald Reagan, remember, Wisconsin was the state that Ronald Reagan did not win."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2018/jun/29/donald-trump/president-trump-makes-some-interesting-claims-abou/	On a warm June afternoon, President Donald Trump proudly presided over the groundbreaking of Foxconn’s new $10 billion operation in Mount Pleasant, Wis. Shovelsful of dirt were tossed and speeches were made hailing the company’s decision to build its complex in Wisconsin. In the midst of it all, Trump took a moment to hail his own 2016 victory in Wisconsin, a win that was vital to securing the presidency. Wisconsin, Trump said on June 28, 2018, "hadn’t been won by a Republican since Dwight D. Eisenhower, in 1952." He went on: "And I won Wisconsin. And I like Wisconsin a lot, but we won Wisconsin. And Ronald Reagan, remember, Wisconsin was the state that Ronald Reagan did not win." (He made a nearly identical claim the night before, at a rally in Fargo, N.D.) Say what, Mr. President? A look at the numbers According to the American Presidency Project, the following Republicans have won Wisconsin’s presidential vote since 1952: 1956: Dwight D. Eisenhower 1960: Richard M. Nixon 1968: Richard M. Nixon 1972: Richard M. Nixon 1980: Ronald Reagan 1984: Ronald Reagan 2016: Donald Trump The Republican presidential dry spell stretched from the 1988 election, when Democrat Michael Dukakis won Wisconsin, through 2012 when Democrat Barack Obama won Wisconsin. But it did not stretch back to Eisenhower. And, for the record, the one state Reagan lost in 1984 was neighboring Minnesota, not Wisconsin. Our rating Trump said Wisconsin "hadn’t been won by a Republican since Dwight D. Eisenhower, in 1952." and that "Wisconsin was the state that Ronald Reagan did not win." Election records show that Trump is wrong on both counts. Very wrong. The president might want to find another applause line for Wisconsin, because Republican candidates not named Trump won the state six times since Eisenhower’s 1952 win.

pomt-07193	Says Craig Huey called Planned Parenthood a "murder mill."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/08/janice-hahn/are-craig-hahn-and-sarah-palin-cut-same-political-/	A new campaign video from California congressional candidate Janice Hahn, a Democratic Los Angeles city councilwoman, is remarkable not so much for its attacks on her opponent Republican Craig Huey -- it's fairly standard abortion and the-Republicans-want-to-end-Medicare fare -- but rather for its efforts to tie Huey's positions to that of former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin. "Sarah Palin and Craig Huey. Which would ban a woman's right to choose in every case? Both Palin and Huey," the narrator begins. "Which supports a radical plan to end Medicare, but wants to give tax breaks to the wealthy? Palin and Huey again." "But which one called Planned Parenthood a 'murder mill'? Only Craig Huey. We don't need Craig Huey's extremist right wing agenda." The Palin cameo is an intriguing political strategy, one that appears to bank on Palin's negative baggage. "They clearly see Palin as a polarizing figure," said Nathan Gonzales, political editor of the independent Rothenberg Political Report in Washington, D.C. "And so the more closely they can tie Huey to Palin the better." The ad appears to be aimed at sparking larger voter turnout in the heavily Democratic Los Angeles district, he said. Huey, a business consultant and political commentator, and Hahn are facing off in a July 12 special election to replace former Democratic Rep. Jane Harman, who retired in February. In this item, we are going to focus our fact-check on the claim that Huey called Planned Parenthood a "murder mill." In a separate item we will focus on whether both Palin and Huey "would ban a woman's right to choose in every case." We have dealt with similar Democratic claims that Republican support for dramatic reforms to Medicare means they want to end Medicare, and we have concluded those claims go too far. This comes from a post to electionforum.org, on May 5, 2011: The murder mill keeps churning This makes me sick. Planned Parenthood gets $350 million in tax dollars each year—nearly $1 million dollars a day. For this, it kills more than 325,000 babies annually. A thousand dollars per abortion… When we first put that quote to Dave Gilliard, a spokesman for Huey's campaign, he said Huey did not recall ever having used that language to describe Planned Parenthood, though he does want to end federal funding of Planned Parenthood because it provides abortions. When presented with a link to the post, Gilliard consulted with Huey and said it appeared a staffer for Huey wrote the post. "From what we can tell, that was posted on his website," Gilliard said. "It's not his language. But he's standing by it, because it's on his website." Gilliard said you won't hear Huey using that phrase, but "he's fine with it. It was on his site." It remains to be seen whether linking Palin to an opponent can be an effective political strategy (much as many tried to tie Republican presidential candidates to George W. Bush in the 2008 campaign) but as for the claim that Huey called Planned Parenthood a "murder mill," it's on Huey's website, and he stands by it. We rule the ad's claims True.

pomt-12058	Says Tony Evers "allowed a middle-school teacher found guilty of spreading pornographic material at school to keep teaching students."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/sep/08/republican-party-wisconsin/wisconsin-gop-mostly-misfires-attack-governor-cand/	The day after word surfaced that state schools superintendent Tony Evers would announce a campaign for governor, the Wisconsin Republican Party attacked. Unveiling a digital ad campaign on Aug. 21, 2017, the GOP claimed Evers "allowed a middle-school teacher found guilty of spreading pornographic material at school to keep teaching students." The Madison-area teacher was fired for viewing images of nudity on his school computer and showing at least one of them to a female co-worker. But he got his job back after an arbitrator ruled he had been improperly fired. And that decision was upheld by two courts. The Republicans contend, in effect, that even though the legal system returned the teacher to his job, Evers had the power to stop him from teaching at all -- anywhere in the state -- by revoking his teaching license. They made essentially the same attack in a radio ad released Sept. 6, 2017. As we’ll see, this fact check turns largely on what state law said at the time about revoking a teacher’s license for "immoral behavior" -- a law that was changed, in part, because of this case. The governor’s race Republican Gov. Scott Walker has all but announced he will seek a third term in 2018. Evers, a Democrat, has won three statewide elections for state superintendent, a nonpartisan office, since 2009. The other leading Democrats with gubernatorial campaigns up and running are Andy Gronik, a businessman who lives in the Milwaukee suburb of Fox Point, and state Rep. Dana Wachs of Eau Claire. The case of Andy Harris The Republican attack centers on Andy Harris, who started teaching in the Middleton-Cross Plains Area School District, west of Madison, in 1993. He had no disciplinary history before his December 2010 firing. At the time, Harris taught seventh-grade science at one of the district’s two middle schools; now he has the same job at the other middle school. Here are the major events in the case, based on news reports, the arbitrator’s decision and a state appeals court decision: Dec. 2009 School district announces Harris had been placed on leave because he received from his sister 23 emails containing pornography and other adult content. Many were jokes that showed images of nude or partially nude women, one of which Harris shared with a co-worker who complained to the principal. None were seen by students. An investigation by the school district finds that more than 30 teachers and administrators had accessed inappropriate jokes or sexually explicit materials on their school computers. Seven educators in addition to Harris were disciplined: five teachers received unpaid suspensions, one substitute teacher was dismissed and an administrator resigned. May 2010 School board fires Harris. The district notifies the state Department of Public Instruction, per a state law requiring school districts to report dismissals that are based on immoral conduct. Feb. 2012 Acting on a grievance filed by the teachers union, arbitrator Karen Mawhinney, a Burlington attorney, overturns Harris’ firing and reduces his penalty to 15 days of unpaid suspension. Harris’ behavior did not meet the state law’s definition of immoral conduct because "there was no endangerment of the health, safety, welfare or education of any pupil," she wrote. She also said "his worst offense is forwarding one inappropriate e-mail to two friends and not exercising the good judgment to discourage his sister from sending these types of e-mails to him." She added: "The fact that he was discharged while others were suspended or received written reprimands or nothing at all, the discharge cannot stand." Aug. 2013 State Court of Appeals upholds a decision made by a circuit court, which had upheld the arbitrator’s decision. Jan. 2014 After state Supreme Court announces it will not review the appeals court decision, Harris returns to the classroom. The next day, Walker asks Evers to begin the process of revoking Harris’ teaching license. Apr. 2014 The Department of Public Instruction announces it will not revoke Harris’ license, saying his conduct "was highly inappropriate" but did not meet the legal definition of "immoral conduct" in state law because it "did not involve children in any manner." Now let’s evaluate the Republicans’ attack. ‘Found guilty’ The GOP says Harris was "found guilty of spreading pornographic material at school," suggesting there was a criminal conviction. Harris did share images of nudity, and at least one instance forwarded an email containing such images, he received on his school computer. But he was never accused of, or charged with, committing any crime. ‘Immoral conduct’ When Harris was fired in December 2010, state law defined immoral conduct, according to the Legislature’s nonpartisan legal advisers, "as conduct or behavior that is contrary to commonly accepted moral or ethical standards and that endangers the health, safety, welfare, or education of any pupil." And is the pivotal word there. (Indeed, the Wisconsin Association of School Boards would make that point in successfully advocating that the law be changed.) Evers’ department did have the discretion on whether to go through license revocation proceedings, which Harris could have challenged. But the department decided against it after concluding, separately from the arbitrator’s decision, that his behavior didn’t endanger kids as defined by the law at that time, spokesman Tom McCarthy told us. In other words, he said, in the department’s view there was no legal basis to take away Harris’ license. That position appears to be supported by the fact that in November 2011, nearly a year after Harris’ firing, Walker signed a measure that redefined immoral conduct to include "the intentional use of an educational agency’s equipment to download, view, solicit, seek, display, or distribute pornographic material." That is, the new law, which Evers supported and which was prompted partly by the Harris case, specifies that what Harris did is legal cause for license revocation -- and that there doesn’t have to be any endangerment of kids. The old law didn’t. Finally, the GOP argues that there was one important fact Evers had that the arbitrator didn’t: After there was outcry from parents about Harris’ return, the school district allowed students to attend a study hall if they didn’t feel comfortable in Harris’ class. The GOP says that endangered students’ education, since they were missing valuable instruction time. In response, McCarthy told us that the law allows the state to revoke a teacher’s license only based on the teacher’s conduct -- not based on parents’ objections to a teacher or a district’s decision to provide an accommodation like the study hall. Our rating The state Republican Party says Evers "allowed a middle-school teacher found guilty of spreading pornographic material at school to keep teaching students." The teacher was not found guilty of, or even charged with, any crime. Rather, he was fired for viewing pornographic material on his school computer. He got his job back, however, after an arbitrator ruled that the firing was not justified, in part because the arbitrator concluded that the behavior did not endanger any students. Evers, as the state schools superintendent, had the discretion to initiate license revocation proceedings. But state law at the time required the endangerment of kids in order to revoke a teacher’s license and, like the arbitrator, Evers concluded that the teacher’s conduct didn’t endanger kids. For a statement that contains only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.

pomt-13261	"We know that more than half of Hillary Clinton's meetings while she was secretary of state were given to major contributors to the Clinton Foundation."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/16/mike-pence/pence-wrongly-says-more-half-hillary-clintons-meet/	Instead of focusing on allegations from several women that Donald Trump sexually violated them, the media should devote attention to the "avalanche of real, hard evidence of corruption" during Hillary Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state, Trump’s running mate Mike Pence said. "The national media is ignoring an avalanche of real, hard evidence of corruption during the years of the Clinton administration," Pence said Oct. 16, 2016, in an interview on NBC’s Meet the Press. "The New York Times just a few minutes ago posted a story about — in exchange for five minutes with Bill Clinton, the government of Qatar was going to give $1 million to the Clinton Foundation. "We know that more than half of Hillary Clinton’s meetings while she was secretary of state were given to major contributors to the Clinton Foundation." We looked at Pence’s claim about Qatar in another fact-check. Here, we’ll focus on his claim that "more than half" of meetings Clinton took as secretary of state were with major donors to her family’s global charity. Pence’s claim comes from an Associated Press story published in August, headlined, "Many donors to Clinton Foundation met with her at State." But "many" does not mean "more than half" of all her meetings. Not even close. Clinton served as secretary of state from 2009-13. The Associated Press analyzed 154 of her State Department meetings and found that 85 of those were with Clinton Foundation donors. Those 85 gave as much as $156 million to the foundation, combined. But this is a tiny subset of Clinton’s meetings. The analysis excluded meetings with people who work for the U.S. government or foreign governments. And it does not include many meetings Clinton took in the second half of her term because the Associated Press only had access to detailed schedules from the first half. ABC reported back in 2013 that Clinton met with 1,700 foreign leaders and had 755 meetings at the White House while secretary of state. So that’s at least 2,455 meetings the Associated Press did not include in its analysis The Associated Press mischaracterized its own reporting in a post on Twitter claiming that "More than half those who met Clinton as Cabinet secretary gave money to Clinton Foundation." The AP later deleted the tweet. Pence described the donors as major. According to the AP, at least 40 of the 85 donors Clinton met with contributed more than $100,000 each. Twenty gave more than $1 million, the AP reported. The Associated Press report showcases the ethical minefield that resulted from the lack of a bright line separating Clinton’s State Department from her family’s foundation. However, merely showing that Clinton met with some foundation donors does not in itself prove any substantial wrongdoing, such as undue influence over State Department policy. For example, the Associated Press article mentions meetings with foundation donors Muhammad Yunus, a Nobel Peace Prize-winning economist from Bangladesh, and Nancy McMahon, head of MAC AIDS, which was partnering with the State Department to address gender-based violence in South Africa. State Department spokesman Mark Toner told the Associated Press that the department does not prohibit meetings with "political campaigns, nonprofits or foundations — including the Clinton Foundation." Our ruling Pence said, "We know that more than half of Hillary Clinton's meetings while she was secretary of state were given to major contributors of the Clinton Foundation." Pence inaccurately described an Associated Press report. The report found that of 154 meetings Clinton took with private individuals over about half of her time as secretary of state, 85 were with people who had donated to the foundation. But the analysis leaves out thousands of meetings Clinton took, including every time she met with employees of both U.S. and foreign governments. It also only covers part of her time as secretary of state. We rate Pence's claim Mostly False.

pomt-11819	Says the individual mandate is "highly unpopular."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/14/donald-trump/how-unpopular-obamacare-individual-mandate/	While President Donald Trump was overseas, he urged on congressional Republicans who were forging ahead with their tax plans. "I am proud of the Republican House and Senate for working so hard on cutting taxes and reform," Trump tweeted Nov. 13. "We’re getting close! Now, how about ending the unfair and highly unpopular Individual Mandate in Obamacare and reducing taxes even further? Cut top rate to 35 percent with all of the rest going to middle income cuts?" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com From Trump's tweet to the Senate Republicans' ears, apparently. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., emerged from a closed-door Republican caucus meeting Nov. 14 saying, "We’re optimistic that inserting the individual mandate repeal would be helpful." The Congressional Budget Office estimated that repeal would reduce deficits by more than $300 billion over 10 years, although about 13 million fewer people would not have health insurance. The health care law’s requirement that most people have coverage has long stuck in Trump’s throat. We wondered if the mandate is "highly unpopular," as he said. The polling shows that it is the least popular of the Affordable Care Act’s changes, but how people feel about it depends on how you frame the question. When asked simply if they like or don’t like the mandate, as many as two-thirds of the people say they don’t. A Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll found that 63 percent had an unfavorable opinion in November 2016. An Associated Press/NORC poll in January 2017 came back with 36 percent in favor, 13 percent who didn’t care one way or the other, and 50 percent who opposed it. The White House press office noted a February 2017 YouGov poll that found that 34 percent favored including the mandate in any bill to replace the Affordable Care Act and 66 percent opposed it. The press office also pointed to similar results from an April 2017 Harris poll. Repeal drive muddied the waters Public opinion became more complicated around the time Republicans started voting on bills to repeal and replace Obamacare. As that process moved forward, more pollsters began asking people if they thought the individual mandate should stay or go. In March 2017, CNN/ORC gave respondents a list of options and asked them if they "favor or oppose including that policy in a replacement bill." Half, 50 percent, said the requirement to obtain coverage should be kept and about half, 48 percent, said it should be ditched. The Kaiser tracking poll in October 2017 took a different approach to the same topic, and got results similar to CNN/ORC. Kaiser set up the question this way: "The Trump administration has made a number of changes related to the health insurance marketplaces. Do you approve or disapprove of the following actions made by the Trump administration?" Kaiser described the policy as "the federal government may stop enforcing the requirement that all individuals have insurance or pay a fine." Half, 50 percent, of the people said they approved of that, while 47 percent said they didn’t. Again, a split decision. An earlier Kaiser tracking poll triggered higher levels of support for enforcing the mandate. In August 2017, pollsters framed the issue in terms of "President Trump taking actions to make the law (Obamacare) fail." Put that way, only one-third, 31 percent, said they wanted Trump to stop enforcing the mandate, and two-thirds said it should be enforced. Broadly speaking, in the context of getting rid of the Affordable Care Act, most polls show that about half of the public opposes the mandate and about half supports it. Policy and politics Obamacare has many moving parts that interact with each other. The individual mandate has a particularly strong tie to the law’s protections for people with pre-existing conditions. The rationale is that if the government is going to force insurance companies to cover everyone, then it must deliver a big insurance pool with a lot of healthy people in it. (There might be other ways to get to more or less the same place, but this fact-check is about the mandate.) The pre-existing conditions protection is popular. In the November 2016 Kaiser poll, nearly 70 percent of the public supported that piece of the puzzle. But only 35 percent liked its evil twin, the individual mandate. In 2014, the Kaiser Family Foundation probed what people know about the mandate and found that opinions were "malleable." "When people were told that most people already fulfill the mandate with coverage they get through an employer or government plan, or that people would not have to pay the fine if buying insurance would take up too large a share of their income, support increased to 6 in 10," said Liz Hamel, director of Kaiser’s public opinion research team. Hamel told us that attitudes about the mandate have shifted as overall support for Obamacare has grown. Republican views have largely held steady, but independents have warmed to the law, and Democrats even more so. "Democrats in particular have rallied around the ACA in the past year as it has come under threat of repeal or dismantling by executive order," Hamel said. "In the current political context, people who support the ACA are willing to defend even the pieces of it that they don’t like rather than see the whole law undermined or repealed." Our ruling Trump said the individual mandate is "highly unpopular." As recently as February 2017, a YouGov poll found that 65 percent of people opposed it, a finding that is consistent with earlier polls from other organizations. That’s a fair sign of the provision’s unpopularity. On the other hand, when people were given more details about the mandate, they had a more favorable view, as high as about 60 percent. And in the context of repealing the Affordable Care Act, the most recent polls found the public generally split 50/50 on whether to keep the mandate in force. Public opinion about the individual mandate is not a simple black-and-white choice. As a leading expert explained, people might not love it, but they are willing to live with it.

pomt-05988	Says most states, but not Texas, permit jurors to ask questions of witnesses in trials.	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/jan/22/efrain-de-la-fuente/efrain-de-la-fuente-says-jurors-most-states-not-te/	A Travis County judicial candidate, Democrat Efrain De La Fuente, told a local group that he favors letting jurors pose questions of witnesses during trials provided the questions are vetted through a judge. "That’s seeking the truth," De La Fuente, who seeks the judgeship of the 167th Criminal District Court, told the Central Austin Democratic Forum on Nov. 29, 2011. "We shouldn’t be paying lip service to this thing we call fact-finding. Looking for the truth. Everybody – most of the states in this country have come on board. Texas needs to come on board." We had no idea Texas was out of step. Asked for backup information, De La Fuente’s campaign manager, Jim Wick, replied by email that jurors in civil trials in Texas are already allowed to ask questions of witnesses, though De La Fuente’s "most states" comment was referring to civil and criminal trials. Wick pointed us to a November 2011 blog post about a 2007 decision by the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland upholding the presentation of two written questions from a jury to a witness. Nationally, that decision says, most state courts that have taken up the question of letting jurors ask questions of witnesses have left that up to trial judges, though a few courts have held juror questioning to be an error or abuse of discretion. A 1992 decision by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, in Morrison v. State, barred juror questioning in Texas criminal cases. In its ruling, the court aired concern that jurors would imperil their impartiality by questioning witnesses. "We know of no authority establishing or authorizing jurors to ask questions of witnesses in the criminal jurisprudence of this state and therefore find the same to be error," the court said. Of courts around the country that do allow juror questioning, the Maryland decision says, many suggest procedures a court should follow. The decision includes guidance from the Kansas Supreme Court stating: "The trial court should not solicit questions and should only permit them for purposes of clarification. The testimony of a witness should not be interrupted by questions from jurors. Jurors should submit questions in writing and without any discussion with other jurors. Counsel should be afforded the opportunity to object outside the presence of the jury. The trial court must determine the relevancy of the questions. The trial court should instruct the jury not to draw any inference if a question submitted is not asked. The trial judge, rather than counsel or jurors, should question the witness. Finally, counsel should be given the right to further examine the witness following the jury’s questions." Legal experts in Texas guided us to Tracy Christopher, a justice on Houston’s 14th Court of Appeals, who has studied juror questioning in civil trials. In a telephone interview, Christopher said that when she was a trial judge, she permitted jurors to question witnesses a few times. "It is a useful tool," she said. "It does slow down the trial slightly." The Texas Supreme Court has not acted on any case testing juror questioning in civil trials, Christopher said, though lower state courts of appeal have concluded that juror questioning is permissible -- with safeguards such as the judge soliciting written questions whose admissibility is determined with the jury and witness out of the courtroom. So, the highest criminal appeals court in Texas has naysayed jurors asking questions in criminal trials. But Texas judges are free to let jurors ask questions in civil trials. Seeking precise information on practices in other states, we read a 2007 report by the National Center for State Courts, which describes itself as an independent court improvement organization. The report states that according to surveys of lawyers and judges, written questions from jurors are "mandated for criminal trials in three states, prohibited in 11 states, and left to the sound discretion of the trial court in the rest," or 36 states. "In civil trials, juror questions are mandated in four states, prohibited in 10 states, and left to the discretion of the trial judge in the rest," the report says. In a telephone interview, an author of the report, Paula Hannaford-Agor, told us Texas ranks among five states -- the others are Georgia, Minnesota, Mississippi and Nebraska -- with court opinions outlawing juror questions in criminal trials. Of late, she said, the practice is strongly discouraged in seven other states -- Illinois, Louisana, Maine, Michigan, North Carolina, Oklahoma and South Carolina -- though no laws or court rulings bar it. Hannaford-Agor said juror questioning of witnesses in Texas civil trials may be allowed, yet it occurs infrequently. Make that very infrequently. In the center’s surveys of Texas judges and attorneys, 1.5 percent of 518 respondents said the judge had allowed juror questions during the respondents’ latest trial in civil court. The surveys were taken from 2004 through 2006, Hannaford-Agor said. As we corraled this information, De La Fuente told us in an interview that he knows juror questioning is already possible in Texas civil courts. He said that he usually tells voters as much, though did not do so at the Democratic forum. If elected, he said, he intends to urge legislators to permit juror questioning in criminal trials. Our ruling As De La Fuente said, Texas is among the minority of states that bar juror questioning in criminal trials. Contrary to what he said at the forum, however, Texas is among the majority of states allowing judges to permit juror questions in civil trials. We rate his overly sweeping claim Half True.

pomt-12313	Obamacare has led to fewer health insurance options for millions of Americans.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jun/21/donald-trump/white-house-tweet-wrongly-says-obamacare-led-fewer/	In its drive to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, the Trump administration turned to Twitter with a list of how bad the program is. "Obamacare has led to higher costs and fewer health insurance options for millions of Americans. It has failed the American people," it tweeted June 21. An accompanying video described multiple failings. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com One of its attack lines jumped out at us as particularly wrong: that Obamacare has led to fewer health insurance options for millions of Americans. On its face, it is wrong. Before passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, many Americans either couldn’t afford insurance or were denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions. That changed with Obamacare. A 2016 estimate from the U.S. Health and Human Services Department put the number of people who gained coverage at 20 million. That included 2.3 million young adults who took advantage of a provision in the law that allowed them to stay on their parents’ plans until they turned 26. The remaining 17.7 million got coverage through either a private plan or public insurance, primarily Medicaid. "Americans inherently have more access to care then they did before Obamacare," said Timothy Callaghan, a health policy professor at the Texas A&M School of Public Health. The drop in the uninsured rate gives another way to look at this. Gallup, a major polling organization, reported that by the first quarter of 2016, the fraction of people ages 18 to 64 without insurance had fallen to 11 percent. "This marks a record low since Gallup and Healthways began tracking the uninsured rate in 2008," the report said. In 2008, the rate was 14.6 percent. Part of the decline was due to an improving economy. About half of Americans get their insurance through their employer. Part was tied to the individual mandate, the provision in the health care law that required all adults to have insurance. Another factor was the expansion of Medicaid for poor people, an option chosen by about 36 states. That provided coverage to about 10.7 million people who weren’t eligible before, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a trusted source of neutral data. The White House statement does apply in a more limited sense. The video included the statistic about insurance companies deciding not to offer policies on the health insurance exchanges set up under the law. The original idea of the exchanges was to have companies competing for business. In many counties, particularly rural ones, it hasn’t turned out that way, said Daniel Polsky, professor of health management at the Wharton School. "Fewer plan options will be available when compared to the early years of the Affordable Care Act," Polsky said. He called that "an unfortunate aspect" of the law, but noted that the White House has added to instability inside the exchanges. Despite requests from insurance companies, the administration has not promised to continue payments that make policies affordable, plus it has indicated it won’t enforce the individual mandate. The exchanges represent a small slice of the insurance market. It’s for people who don’t get insurance through their jobs or a public program like Medicaid or Medicare. The individual market covers about 7 percent of all Americans, and slightly more than half of those policies are sold on the exchanges. We reached out to the White House for this fact-check and did not hear back before we published. Our ruling The White House tweeted that Obamacare has led to fewer health insurance options for millions of Americans. About 20 million more people have insurance today than before, directly as a result of the new health care law. The White House neglects that critical point. The sole thread of truth is that with the insurance exchanges set up by the law, the number of carriers has dwindled. That is a real problem, but as experts and insurance companies have noted, that is partly a result of what this administration has done. Its policies on spending and enforcement have undercut the ability of carriers to participate in the exchanges. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-10197	"I said two years ago that the Fannie and Freddie thing was a very serious problem and we had to work on it."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/17/john-mccain/ringing-an-alarm-not-averting-a-crisis/	The turmoil on Wall Street is prompting the presidential candidates to offer prescriptions for restoring order to U.S. financial markets. John McCain is using the opportunity to remind voters that he called on Congress to crack down on government-chartered mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Appearing on CNN's American Morning on Sept. 16, 2008, McCain sought to blame much of the crisis on Wall Street greed and inept or corrupt government regulators. "Ask any American citizen who has been the victim of a bureaucrat or a bureaucracy," McCain said. "I said two years ago that the Fannie and Freddie thing was a very serious problem and we had to work on it. And I have always opposed greed of Wall Street and I know how we can fix this." McCain echoed his remarks later in the day during a speech in Tampa, saying, "Two years ago, I warned the administration and the Congress that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac needed to be fixed. It turns out, the problem was even bigger. They waited too long, and now we have a housing crisis, three bailouts with taxpayers' money, and a financial crisis." In both appearances, McCain was referring to his 2006 decision to sign on to a Republican-led regulatory overhaul of the mortgage-financing firms, which both went through multibillion-dollar accounting scandals earlier in the decade. The occasion that prompted McCain's involvement was the release of a 340-page report from the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight that concluded that Fannie Mae had manipulated earnings and violated basic accounting principles. It describes an "arrogant and unethical corporate culture" in which executives were more concerned about their bonuses than meeting the company's housing mission. The findings, based on a 27-month investigation and resulting in a $400-million fine paid to the government, prompted McCain to join other critics and call for more scrutiny of Fannie and its sibling, Freddie Mac. "If Congress does not act, American taxpayers will continue to be exposed to the enormous risk that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pose to the housing market, the overall financial system, and the economy as a whole," McCain declared in a May 26, 2006, news release. So it's true that McCain spoke out — after a widely read report drew attention to chicanery at the firms. But the implication in McCain's remarks is that his remarks in 2006 were in some way a warning about the financial markets disaster that struck in 2008. That strikes us as quite a stretch. First of all, congressional efforts to increase oversight of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac extend back to the early 1990s, making McCain a latecomer to the debate. The regulatory efforts proved unsuccessful because of Congress' complicated relationship with the firms, whose dominance in the home financing market makes their stability critical to the economy. Fannie and Freddie are government-sponsored enterprises — a type of private corporation created by Congress for an explicit purpose; in this case, to lower the cost of capital in the housing market. Though critics have long maintained that the firms were too large and didn't have enough capital to guard against risk, many lawmakers worried that stricter regulation would interfere with the firms' role in the housing market. (The now-defunct Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, known as OFHEO, oversaw Fannie and Freddie but had limited regulatory authority.) In his appearances, McCain tries to connect the accounting scandals with the broader meltdown in the mortgage markets. But the current crisis arose because banks and mortgage companies made risky "subprime" loans to people with poor credit histories that were then packaged into securities and sold to institutional investors. As interest rates rose and home prices began to fall, homeowners unable to refinance the loans or sell their properties began to default, unleashing a cascade effect through financial markets. That phenomenon had nothing to do with Fannie and Freddie's internal problems; in fact, both firms were praised for cushioning the financial free fall and keeping the market afloat by spending billions of dollars to purchase subprime loans. Even if the 2006 effort to strengthen oversight had succeeded, it's debatable whether it would have averted the subprime crisis. The extent of the problems was not yet fully known, and it's a leap of faith to suggest that regulators granted expanded power would have noticed a deterioration in Fannie and Freddie's loan portfolios soon enough, and would have sounded an alarm. Shaken by the extent of the subprime crisis, Congress and the Bush administration earlier this year completed a regulatory overhaul by combining OFHEO and the Federal Housing Finance Board into a new regulatory body, the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Last weekend, the government took the additional step of placing the two firms into conservatorship — essentially a government takeover in which Treasury will extend up to $200-billion of support to the companies. Barack Obama's campaign responded to McCain's remarks by labeling his desire for tougher oversight a myth. Obama spokesman Tommy Vietor noted that McCain in 1992 voted against imposing stricter controls on Fannie and Freddie during Senate debate on a broader housing bill, and this year argued against providing big government bailouts in response to the crisis, whether for big lenders or homeowners. We give McCain some credit for weighing in on problems surrounding Fannie Mae, even though he got involved after a comprehensive government report issued a loud alarm to anyone watching. However, his attempts to depict those efforts as some sort of early warning that could have lessened the current credit crisis just don't wash. All McCain was talking about then was the potential fallout of accounting troubles in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. He didn't say anything about a freewheeling climate among creditors that had major financial institutions becoming badly leveraged on bad loans. We rule his claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-00918	Says President Barack Obama made "unilateral changes" to Obamacare "38 times."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/mar/01/john-boehner/boehner-obama-has-taken-unilateral-action-health-c/	In making the case that President Barack Obama overstepped his bounds on immigration, House Speaker John Boehner pointed to another sore spot: Obamacare. "It’s the president of the United States overreaching, and that’s just not on immigration. You know 38 times he made unilateral changes to Obamacare," Boehner said on CBS’ Face the Nation March 1. "Many of these, I believe, far beyond his constitutional authority to do so." PolitiFact looked into a similar claim about Obama’s actions on the Affordable Care Act in 2013, when Rep. Tom Graves, R-Ga., said Obama had made 19 changes to the health care legislation since it became law in 2010. We rated that claim Half True. So we wondered where Boehner got the 38 "unilateral changes" figure. Boehner’s staff pointed us to the Galen Institute, a think tank that promotes free-market principles in health care. A Feb. 25 article lists 48 changes to the Affordable Care Act, but they aren’t all unilateral -- meaning that weren’t made by the Obama administration without the input of the other branches of government. The Galen Institute’s list includes: Two changes because of Supreme Court decisions; 17 changes as the result of congressional action; 29 changes by the Obama administration. Among the unilateral actions by the administration, according to Galen: delays on insurance provider transparency requirements, choosing which mandates apply to U.S. territories, and delaying the policy sign-up deadline. Galen Institute President Grace-Marie Turner told PolitiFact that the think tank will soon update its unilateral action count to 30, with the administration’s recent decision to reduce cost-sharing. The law originally called for out-of-pocket maximums to be lowered for those between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level, but the administration changed this provision to only apply to those between 100 and 250 percent of the poverty level. She added that the administration repeated three of the unilateral actions, bringing the count up to 33. And an August 2014 report by the Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan government program, included five additional examples. All of these combined adds up to 38, Turner said. It’s worth noting, though, that the Congressional Research Service report does not count every single administrative change to the Affordable Care Act. Instead, it selectively chose the "more significant actions that have been the subject of debate among health policy analysts and, in some instances, the target of criticism by opponents of the ACA." So according to the report, there have been 12 significant "delays, extensions" or "other actions taken by the administration." The report says that the most controversial action has been the 2013 decision to delay enforcement of the employer mandate -- the requirement that employers with 50 or more employees must offer full-time workers affordable health insurance or pay a penalty -- to 2015. Larry Jacobs, chair of political studies at the University of Minnesota, said that in addition to the employer mandate delay, the most significant actions have been abandoning the long-term care program (CLASS) and the small employer program (SHOP). Of Galen’s more comprehensive list, most are technical changes, rather than policy changes, said James Thurber, director of American University’s Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies. "Most are insignificant administrative actions by (Health and Human Services)," Thurber wrote in an email to PolitiFact. "This is common under all presidents." Our previous fact-check on this subject noted that Medicare Part D, the prescription drug benefit passed under President George W. Bush, was changed several times after its initial passage. For example, the Bush administration chose to extend the deadline and waive penalty fees for Medicare Part D enrollees. "Presidents always use administration to find feasible, workable paths and to work their agenda," Jacobs said. "Since Nixon and then Reagan, an ‘administrative presidency’ has emerged where presidents use their large administrative staff, agencies and departments to work their way." Our ruling Boehner said Obama made "unilateral changes" to Obamacare "38 times." Boehner’s staff sent us a link to 29 unilateral actions, and it takes some creative picking and choosing to get the count up to 38 -- including counting two delays of the same regulation as separate actions. Further, the Congressional Research Service only considers 12 of these actions to be significant policy changes. Lastly, experts said administrative changes are a routine part of the lawmaking process and have occurred "under all presidents." Boehner’s claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.

pomt-06755	"Recent international reports show the United States near the bottom among industrialized nations for k-12 academic achievement."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2011/aug/23/chip-rogers/us-students-big-trouble-georgia-pol-says/	Americans don’t like finishing second to any nation in anything. When the Soviet Union became the first nation to send a man into outer space, the United States responded by landing on the moon. When we started to lose to other countries in basketball, America created the Dream Team and crushed the competition in the 1992 Summer Olympics. In recent years, politicians have lamented America’s education standing with the goal of doing better. Georgia state Senate Majority Leader Chip Rogers talked about the problem -- and offered some ideas -- at a Republican Party-led "Solutions Summit" in Athens last month. An Athens Banner-Herald article included a claim by Rogers, a Republican from Cherokee County, that the U.S. is near the bottom of developed nations in education. Near the bottom! U.S. students can’t be performing that poorly? The article paraphrased Rogers, so we asked his office whether the newspaper got it right. It did, said Rogers’ chief of staff Adam Pipkin. "Recent international reports show the United States near the bottom among industrialized nations for k-12 academic achievement," Rogers said at the meeting. Rogers’ office showed us the information he used to back up his claim: a weblink from a prominent education foundation that compared America’s top math students with top math students in other nations. The link, from the Broad Foundation, says eighth-graders in America are two years behind in the math studied in other countries. Let’s focus on the first part of what was on the foundation’s page. The ranking came from a 2006 study of students for the Program for International Student Assessment, which examines the academic performance of 15-year-old students in math, reading and science in more than 60 nations. Students were asked the same questions, such as estimating the size of Antarctica or determining the best route between various rail stations. An international contractor randomly selects schools to take the exam, PISA organizers say. The selection of schools and students, they say, is said to be as inclusive as possible. U.S. Department of Education officials say 5,233 U.S. students took the 2009 exam. The most recent assessment, however, was done in 2009. That study focused on about 60 nations. We focused on about 30 countries, since the rest are not on the United Nations’ and/or CIA’s lists of developed nations. In that assessment, American students, on average, indeed ranked near the bottom of about 30 developed nations in math. American students ranked in the middle in science and in the top half in reading. The 2009 report was released in December 2010. Pipkin countered that the 2009 PISA report included U.S. students in public and private schools, "so it is difficult to determine where the public school students would have ranked as an individual group." Rogers, however, did not say he was specifically speaking about public school students. Pipkin had another concern about the 2009 report. He said it included nations such as Chile, Estonia, Israel and Slovenia that he said aren’t "international competition" and helped boost the U.S. into the middle in the science category. We did use Israel, but not the others for our comparison. The U.S. still ranked in the middle in science. We then reviewed a report on the U.S. Department of Education’s website that tracked fourth- and eighth-grade U.S. students against their counterparts in other countries in math and science. The report, called the "Trends in International Math and Science Study," was from 2007. American fourth-graders ranked in the top third in both subjects. The eighth-graders did as well in math but were in the middle in science. As with the PISA exam, we excluded countries not on the CIA’s and/or United Nations’ lists of developed nations. The tests are said to be administered the same way in all countries. Officials acknowledge that some countries, such as the U.S., have a higher percentage of immigrant students, which may be a factor in the scores since they are not taking the exam in their native language. Students in each country are selected from a national probability sample of all students in the particular grade or of a particular age. The exam is voluntary. Now, to the claim about eighth-graders. That came from a 2003 report by Michigan State University professor William H. Schmidt that is on the U.S. Department of Education’s website. Schmidt wrote American 12th-graders ranked near the bottom internationally on a math literacy exam. American eighth-graders were also below average internationally. We were initially dubious of the article, since he mentioned studies done in 1995 and 1999. That seemed like such a long time ago. A student could have begun first grade in 1999 and graduated this year. Schmidt, a distinguished professor of statistics and math, explained he prefers the earlier research to the 2007 study. He said the earlier studies include more nations that are a better comparison for U.S. students. Schmidt believes much hasn’t changed since the reports from the late 1990s. "The best [U.S. students] in some indicators are in the middle of the pack, but at the worst, at the bottom," he told us. Schmidt believes some developed nations such as Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan and the Netherlands are better at math and science because their educational systems are more focused with rigorous standards for their students. For example, he said eighth-graders in some nations are learning algebra and geometry while American students are still focused on less complex arithmetic. Schmidt also said most American eighth-grade teachers are not as versed in math as their counterparts in many nations. Schmidt said there is hope for U.S. students to make a Rocky-like comeback in math. He said about 40 states have adopted the Common Core State Standards -- national expectations for what students should learn and be able to do in every grade level and subject. In July 2010, Georgia’s Board of Education approved Common Core Standards in English and math. So back to Rogers and his claim. The most recent international reports that include developed nations show American students are in the bottom third in math, in the middle in science and in the upper third in reading. The results don’t entirely back up the senator’s claim. They show he’s partially accurate. We rate his claim as Half True.

pomt-06322	"Ronald Reagan raised the national debt 18 times."	true	/virginia/statements/2011/nov/12/jim-webb/sen-jim-webb-says-ronald-reagan-raised-debt-ceilin/	U.S. Senator Jim Webb, who will not seek reelection next year, has been lamenting the partisanship that grips the nation. During a recent interview with ABC News, the Virginia Democrat was incredulous over the fighting that occurred this summer before Congress raised the debt ceiling so the United States could pay its bills. An August deal raised the federal government’s $14.3 trillion borrowing authority to $16.4 trillion, a level that is expected to keep the government operating until early 2013. "(President) Ronald Reagan raised the national debt 18 times," said Webb, a former Republican who served as Reagan’s secretary of the Navy . Webb is hardly the first Democrat to cite Reagan’s record on the debt limit. President Barack Obama, in a televised speech on July 25, said raising the borrowing cap has been a routine practice by Congress and presidents since the 1950s. Obama also said Reagan increased the debt ceiling 18 times. We asked Webb’s office what the Senator based his statement on. Will Jenkins, Webb’s director of communications, cited a chart by the Office of Management and Budget that details 18 different laws signed to raise the debt limit during Reagan’s presidency from January 1981 to January 1989. This seemed like a cut-and-dry case for PolitiFact Virginia. But like so many of the claims we investigate, there was a snag. We came across several news stories saying Reagan hiked the debt limit 17 times, not 18. For example, Chris Van Hollen, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee, was quoted in a July 16, 2011, article in The Hill newspaper using the lower number. We also found references to 17 Reagan-era debt limit hikes in The Washington Post and FactCheck.org. We looked at the OMB chart again. After each law increasing the borrowing limit is a column showing the new, higher level of the debt ceiling. Two of the 18 bills - one approved on May 15, 1987, and another approved on July 30, 1987 - are listed as boosting the debt limit to the same amount -- $2.32 trillion. Should they be counted as one increase, or two? Richard Kogan, a senior fellow at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, noted in an e-mail that the May, 1987 increase to $2.32 trillion was a temporary hike. When that limit expired on July 17, 1987, the debt limit reverted to a previous level of $2.1 trillion, Kogan said. But after a couple of weeks, Congress passed yet another temporary debt boost at the end of July 1987 increasing the debt ceiling from $2.1 trillion back to $2.32 trillion, he said. Kogan, a former senior adviser to the Office of Management and Budget, said it’s a semantic question as to whether the July, 1987 should be considered its own increase, but added he personally would consider it a second debt ceiling hike. Our ruling: Webb said Reagan signed off 18 times on increasing the national debt. Figures from the Office of Management and Budget do show 18 laws were signed to increase the debt limit during Reagan’s eight years in office. A semantic argument can be made that the actual debt limit was raised only 17 times during the Reagan administration, but we don’t think it’s worth the haggle. We rate Webb’s statement True.

pomt-08865	"Democrats are poised now to cause this largest tax increase in U.S. history."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/04/sarah-palin/sarah-palin-said-democrats-planning-largest-tax/	Sarah Palin said she wrote her notes on her hand so the "liberals" couldn't say she got her numbers wrong when she appeared on Fox News Sunday. Well, we're independent fact-checkers, and we still found accuracy issues with the former governor's statements on the expiring Bush tax cuts. "Let's turn to the Bush tax cuts, which are also becoming a big issue, the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy," said host Chris Wallace. "The Obama White House is now saying end the tax cuts. And these are the tax cuts for the top 2 percent of all households in America. You can save $678 billion, and it won't hurt the recovery. Governor, if you're serious, as you say you are, about the deficit, don't you have to do something?" "To reduce deficit spending and our enormous debt, you rein in spending," Palin replied. "You cut the budget. You don't take more from the private sector and grow government with it. ... The Obama administration and the Democrats in Congress -- they're all wet on this idea. It's idiotic to think about increasing taxes at a time like this." Wallace: " But you know, they would argue, 'Look, the economy did just fine during the Clinton years. The rates on the top 2 percent would be restored to what they were during the Clinton years.' The Republicans keep talking about being deficit hawks. This is $678 billion you're not going to pay for. They're saying you're being hypocritical. I say 'you' -- I'm talking about Republicans." Palin: "Yeah. No, this is going to result in the largest tax increase in U.S. history. And again, it's idiotic. And my palm isn't large enough to have written all my notes down on what this tax increase will result in. Let me just go through a couple of things that I want people to be aware of, because, you know, the spin coming from Gibbs and the White House -- you're never going to get the truth out of their messaging. But Democrats are poised now to cause this largest tax increase in U.S. history. It's a tax increase of $3.8 trillion over the next 10 years, and it will have an effect on every single American who pays an income tax. Small businesses especially will be hit hardest. ..." Wallace: "Can I just ask you, what do you have written on your hand?" Palin: "$3.8 trillion, next 10 years, so I didn't say 3.7 and then get dinged, you know, by the liberals saying I didn't know what I was talking about." (Read the complete exchange.) What caught our attention for fact-checking purposes was her claim that the Democratic plan would result in "the largest tax increase in history." Wallace's question was about letting the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy expire. President Barack Obama's plan would increase income taxes for individuals making more than $200,000 and for couples making more than $250,000, with indexing for inflation. Wallace mentions that the Republican proposal to retain the tax cuts for the wealthy is "$678 billion you're not going to pay for." That's a reasonable estimate of how much increasing taxes on top earners would generate over 10 years. Palin, however, responded as if the Democrats intend to allow all the Bush tax cuts to expire for everyone. If that were to happen, it would increase tax revenues by approximately $3.8 trillion over ten years. But that's not what Democrats are proposing; they want to leave tax rates untouched for people who make less. We've looked for a Democrat who supports letting all the Bush tax cuts expire, and we haven't been able to find one. (And in fact, the most notable person we've found who advocates letting them all expire is Alan Greenspan, the head of the Federal Reserve from 1987 to 2006. He said it would help bring down the deficit.) In fact, a handful of Democrats in Congress have supported keeping tax rates for the wealthy lower, too. But, to be clear, the tax cuts passed during the Bush administration do expire at the end of 2010. So if Congress doesn't act, taxes will go up for most people. The reason the tax cuts have expiration dates is because they were passed via a procedure known as reconciliation, which only requires 50 votes in the Senate. At the time, members of Congress hesitated to make them permanent for fear of deficits. So Palin is confusing the issue here by using numbers that assume all the tax cuts are going away. That is not the Democratic plan nor is it President Obama's plan. Now, let's look at the potential tax increases in comparison with other tax increases throughout history. Economists like to do this by calculating tax increases as a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product, or GDP. GDP means a country's entire annual economic economic output; it's a way of measuring the entire economy. If we calculate tax increases as a percentage of GDP, it means we don't have to worry about distortions from variables like inflation or economic growth. The most prominent study of tax increases and tax cuts over time was done by the U.S. Treasury Department, "Revenue Effects of Major Tax Bills." It calculated the size of all major tax provisions from 1940 to 2006 by calculating them as a percentage of GDP. There are no formal congressional proposals yet to keep the Bush tax cuts in place, so we don't have precise estimates from official sources like the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Still, there's a good bit of consensus on what the tax increases would look like, both if lower rates expired only for high earners and also for all incomes. Wallace's number of $678 billion over 10 years is reasonable for high earners, and Palin's estimate of $3.8 trillion over 10 years is within a reasonable range, if you're talking about all taxpayers. (We've also seen estimates of $3.7 trillion and $3.2 trillion.) We ran the number with some help from tax experts and found that if only the tax cuts for high earners expire, the resulting tax increases would not be the largest in history. Tax increases for high earners would be roughly 0.4 percent of GDP in the first year they take effect. That's significantly less than a 1982 tax increase signed into law by President Ronald Reagan. The tax increase resulting from the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 came to 1.23 percent of GDP when the tax changes were fully implemented, four years after the law's passage. If you let all the Bush tax cuts expire, the tax increase would come to just above 2.2 percent of GDP. Clearly, that would be larger than the Reagan tax hike of 1982. But it would be smaller than one of the tax increases passed during World War II -- the Revenue Act of 1942, which is estimated at 5.04 percent of GDP. But again, letting all the tax cuts expire isn't the plan the Democrats are proposing, and it's not what Wallace asked Palin. Palin said, "Democrats are poised now to cause this largest tax increase in U.S. history." She was asked about tax cuts for the top 2 percent. Either Palin is confused about the revenue numbers involved with extending the tax cuts, or she's willfully distorting the Democratic plans. We'll let you be the judge of that. Regardless, Wallace was very specific about asking her about tax increases for the top 2 percent. And that does not represent the largest tax increase in history. The unlikely outcome that she seems to be talking about -- that all of the Bush tax cuts will be repealed -- wouldn't be the largest tax increase in history either. Palin read the number on her hand correctly, but that's about all she got right. So we rate her statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-08642	Horse racing could boost Georgia's economy by $1 billion a year and create 10,000 to 20,000 jobs.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2010/sep/17/jb-powell/candidate-says-georgia-could-cash-horse-racing/	Georgia agriculture commissioner candidate J.B. Powell is willing to make a bet on the ponies. He wants the Peach State to allow horse racing. "Georgians deserve to have a commissioner of agriculture who will fight for common-sense ideas that will help lead Georgia out of the economic challenges we face," Powell, the Democratic Party's nominee for commissioner, said in a Sept. 9 news release. Powell believes horse racing could increase the state's struggling economy by $1 billion a year and create at least 10,000 jobs. Bugle player, begin the first call song please. Powell is in a three-man race to replace Democrat Tommy Irvin, who has been Georgia's agriculture commissioner since 1969. Gary Black is the Republican Party's nominee. Kevin Cherry is running as a Libertarian. So can this plan create as many jobs as Powell says and bring in that much money to Georgia? The idea is not new in Georgia. State lawmakers have discussed it before, but some conservatives have been reluctant to support another form of gambling. The state constitution must be amended to allow gambling on horse racing, also known as pari-mutuel betting. The candidate's evidence in support of horse racing is a 2006 study done for the Washington, D.C.-based American Horse Council by Deloitte, a well-known financial advisory and auditing firm. Horse racing generates an annual economic impact of $26 billion and nearly 147,000 jobs in the United States, according to the study. The Powell campaign based its estimate on Georgia's potential on how horse racing is performing in Florida. The Deloitte report found Florida sees an annual total economic impact of $2.2 billion from horse racing. The report said horse racing is responsible for 22,000 direct jobs and 51,700 total jobs. Graham Balch, Powell's campaign manager, noted that the Sunshine State has 18.5 million residents. Georgia's population is about 9.8 million. Since Georgia's population is about one-half of Florida's, Balch believes it is reasonable to conclude Georgia could see 50 percent of the economic impact from horse racing. Another advantage Georgia has is Atlanta ranks only behind Ocala, Fla., and Lexington, Ky., in the number of horse owners. "Given Georgia's level of horse ownership and climate and size, it is a realistic projection to say Georgia could at least have an economic impact of $1 billion or more like eight states around the country," Balch wrote in an e-mail to AJC PolitiFact Georgia. "All fact based information leads us to believe that $1 billion in economic impact and 10,000 to 20,000 jobs is the best estimate possible and in our research we have not seen any information to contradict the projections for Georgia." Powell believes Georgia can get to the $1 billion mark, but it will take time -- at least three years. Georgia would be beginning in the horse racing business while Florida has a head start, said Jeff Williams, senior vice president of Public Sector Consulting, a nonpartisan research firm that did a study on the economic impact of horse racing in Michigan in 2002. "I would be very careful when looking at a neighboring state and say 'They do x and we can do y,' " Williams said. The Michigan study found horse racing had an economic impact of $1.2 billion in 2001. Michigan had a population of nearly 10 million residents in 2000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Regulated pari-mutuel horse racing has been in existence in Michigan since the 1930s. Michigan had seven racetracks at the time. Public Sector Consulting used revenue from racetrack operations as the primary factor to determine the economic impact. Williams said Georgia must examine how many people would come for horse racing from outside the state. He said spectators and bettors from Georgia could be taking away revenue from other in-state leisure activities. Williams also issued another warning: Horse racing in Michigan was suffering economically at the time of the study. The industry, he and others noted, is now in a more precarious state financially across the country. Some say the answer is combining horse racing and casino gambling. Arthur H. Anderson, a consultant for a committee attempting to bring racing to Georgia and South Carolina, said places such as Hoosier Park in Indiana show the idea can work. Anderson, who is involved with the Georgia-South Carolina Horse Racing Committee, estimates a casino/racetrack with a "funplex" for children and destination shopping can generate about $500 million a year. The committee would use the revenue to support the state's education system. Anderson supports running two tracks in Georgia, which he says can bring $1 billion to the state. A casino would need state approval, and Georgia's leaders have been against the idea. The Indianapolis Star reported in May that money wagered on horse racing in Indiana has dropped from $190 million in 2005 to $147 million in 2009. Money from slot machines has been used to supplement lagging horse racing revenue, the Star reported. The American Horse Council study found the economic impact of horse racing in Indiana in 2005 was $294 million. Powell's proposal would not include casino gambling, his campaign manager said. We looked at Virginia because it is a Southern state, its population of nearly 8 million people is closer to Georgia's and its one pari-mutuel racetrack, Colonial Downs, opened in 1997. One report from about five years ago shows the annual economic impact of the horse industry is $1 billion, which includes recreation equine activity. Virginia equine leaders note the horse racing business there has suffered in recent years. The Deloitte study on Florida found about 40 percent of the horse industry's economic impact in that state comes from racing. At that rate, the annual impact for horse racing in Virginia would be about $400 million. Virginia officials are working on an economic impact study. We believe there are some problems in using Florida to determine the potential economic impact of horse racing in Georgia. For example, Florida draws more tourists, some of whom are inclined to visit the racetrack. Some well-respected economists, such as the University of Georgia's Jeff Humphreys, said Powell's estimate may be correct, but more information is needed. We agree and rate the candidate's statement as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	J.B. Powell	None	None	None	2010-09-17T06:00:00	2010-09-09	['None']
pomt-02573	"The majority of teams (are) now spending their dollars on the offensive side of the football."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jan/30/mark-schlereth/espns-schlereth-says-teams-now-spend-their-money-o/	ESPN's Mark Schlereth, a former offensive lineman for the Washington Redskins and Denver Broncos, says offenses get all the breaks these days in the National Football League. That’s one of the reasons Schlereth is picking the Broncos and quarterback Peyton Manning to beat the Seattle Seahawks in the Super Bowl 31-17. The offenses-first trend has spread from NFL policies to refereeing to the contracts teams award players, Schlereth said on Mike & Mike. "We use to say defense wins championships? … Are we now at a place, Mark, with the way the game is played where the offense has the edge?" asked host Mike Greenberg. "Based on the way all the rules have been for the passing game and to protect the quarterback and you can't hit people, yes, certainly," Schlereth said. "The rules are bent that way for the offense to have the advantage, I think, and that's why you see the majority of teams now spending their dollars on the offensive side of the football." We decided to dig a little deeper into how the NFL’s 32 teams allocate their salaries to see if Schlereth is correct. NFL teams this year have a salary cap of about $123 million, which is generally the maximum teams can spend on players. There are plenty of ways for teams to manipulate that figure, and several teams spend way below the salary cap. The NFL Players Association publishes a public report showing overall spending toward the salary cap for each team but not a detailed breakdown by offense vs. defense. To find that, we turned to Spotrac.com, which provides a much more detailed position-by-position analysis. Their reporting is used by USA Today, the Guardian and others to report about NFL spending patterns. In the end, it’s something of an estimate, but it’s the best information publicly available and considered reliable. So are NFL teams predominantly spending their money building offenses as Schlereth suggested? We’ll start with the big numbers and work backward. For the 2013-14 year, the NFL’s 32 teams spent a total of $1.7 billion on offensive players compared to $1.6 billion on defensive players. If you measured the money as a percentage, that would translate to 51.5 percent offense, 48.5 percent defense (the margin is actually closer once you consider that NFL teams spend money on a kicker and punter who are not part of either the offense or defense). For perspective, that’s closer than the popular vote in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections. Spending by individual teams varies greatly. The Philadelphia Eagles spent nearly $74 million on offensive players, compared to $38.5 million on defensive players. The Cincinnati Bengals, conversely, spent $69 million on defensive players and $45 million on offensive personnel. (Both of those teams made the playoffs.) The Seahawks and Broncos both spend more money on offense, by the way. But while the Broncos are considered the "offensive" team, the Seahawks actually spend a few extra million dollars on their offensive team. Team Offensive spending Defensive spending Seattle $69,386,205 $51,800,008 Denver $66,084,673 $47,763,533 Overall, of the NFL’s 32 teams, 11 spent more money on defense than offense, three teams spent just about the same amount on offense and defense and 18 spent more money on offense than defense. To put that in percentages, a little more than 56 percent of teams spend more on offense and about 44 percent do not. That gives the offenses the edge, though not decisively so. One last note: By saying "now," Schlereth is suggesting that the move toward spending on offenses is a recent development. That’s not necessarily correct. While salary cap data is harder to come by for previous years, we did find a Sports Illustrated list of all NFL players from 2008 and their salaries. In 2008, offensive players made $1.7 billion (the same amount they made in 2013) while defensive players made about $1.52 billion. Part of the difference is simple numbers -- NFL teams paid 85 more offensive players in 2008 than they did defensive players. Our ruling Schlereth said, "The majority of teams (are) now spending their dollars on the offensive side of the football." We reached out to Schlereth through his chili sauce company (yes, really) but did not hear back. There’s definitely evidence that NFL teams are spending more money on offensive players than defensive players. It's part of the reality of NFL football, where the most expensive players are typically quarterbacks. But the disparity wasn’t that significant in 2013, and it’s actually less than it was in 2008. Schlereth's claim is accurate but needs clarification. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Mark Schlereth	None	None	None	2014-01-30T14:00:00	2014-01-27	['None']
pomt-14672	Says Hillary Clinton called Barack Obama "naive" for saying he was would "sit down and talk to the Iranians" during the 2008 Democratic primary.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/17/bernie-sanders/sanders-obama-was-right-clinton-was-wrong-iran/	Recent positive developments in the United States’ relationship with Iran proves that President Barack Obama was right, and Hillary Clinton was wrong, said Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders. On Jan. 17, 2016, Obama announced that Iran released several American prisoners, among other diplomactic achievements, including a legal settlement over a military equipment dispute. NBC’s Meet the Press host Chuck Todd asked Sanders Jan. 17 if he thinks Iran is still an enemy of the United States. "It’s funny," Sanders replied. "If you think back to 2007 during the campaign in which Secretary Clinton ran against Barack Obama, she was critical of him. A question was asked to Obama that said, ‘Would you sit down and talk to the Iranians?’ And he said, ‘Yeah, I would." Point being, you talk to your adversaries. You don’t run away from that. Secretary Clinton, I think, called him naive. Turns out that Obama was right." Clinton and Obama’s back-and-forth on Iran and other foreign policy issues was a main feature of the 2008 Democratic primary. At one point, Clinton did call Obama’s position on Iran diplomacy "naive," but Sanders is leaving out important nuance that misrepresents her position at the time. Fighting words This all started at a July 2007 Democratic presidential debate, where CNN took questions from YouTube users. One user asked, "Would you be willing to meet separately, without precondition, during the first year of your administration, in Washington or anywhere else, with the leaders of Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Cuba and North Korea, in order to bridge the gap that divides our countries?" Obama was the first to respond, saying, "I would. And the reason is this, that the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them, which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of (the George W. Bush) administration, is ridiculous." (Obama made similar comments throughout the campaign.) Clinton also answered the question, saying she agreed that she would approach adversaries differently than the Bush administration and "get back to diplomacy." But she distinguished herself from Obama by saying she, as president, would not necessarily meet with these leaders in her first year, without any preconditions, which is what the YouTube question asked specifically. Instead, she would first send envoys. Clinton’s "naive" comment came the next day in an interview with the Quad-City Times in Iowa. "I think it is wrong for any president to say he or she will not talk to people because they’re bad or evil," she said. "But the question was very specific, asking whether either of us would talk to a list of leaders of five countries with which the United States has serious difficulties within the first year of becoming president, and I thought that was irresponsible and frankly naive to say he would commit to meeting with Chavez and Castro and others within the first year. As I said last night, there has to be a lot of diplomatic effort." Sanders’ made it sound like Clinton shut the door on diplomacy, when in reality she was supportive of diplomacy, though she advocated for a more cautious approach than Obama. Competing memos from both campaigns emphasized this distinction, and the two candidates argued about it at another primary debate. At the time, we gave Obama a Mostly False rating for claiming that Clinton "agrees with (John McCain) in embracing the Bush-Cheney policy of not talking to leaders we don't like." Clinton clearly said she would approach diplomacy differently than the Bush administration. It’s worth noting that Obama did not personally meet with Iranian leaders in his first year. It wasn’t until 2013 that he spoke over the phone with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani — the highest-level talks between the two countries in 30 years. Obama did announce in April 2009, four months into his first term, that the United States and five other countries would engage in talks with Iran — the P5+1 group that eventually negotiated the nuclear deal. For her part, Clinton as secretary of state was personally involved in diplomatic efforts to increase global sanctions on Iran that helped move the nuclear deal forward. Our ruling Sanders said that Clinton called Obama "naive" for saying he was would "sit down and talk to the Iranians" during the 2008 Democratic primary. This is a simplified description of the back-and-forth between Clinton and Obama. Both candidates said they supported more diplomacy between Iran and the United States than what the Bush administration had pursued. Clinton’s position differed from Obama’s in that she supported a slower approach, starting with lower-level talks. Obama, on the other hand, said he would be willing to meet with Iranian leaders in his first year as president, without preconditions. It was Obama’s approach to diplomacy with Iran that she called naive, not the idea of pursuing diplomatic relations in general. Ultimately, Obama did not meet himself with Iranian leaders in his first year. Sanders’ statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context, so we rate it Half True.

pomt-03474	A hidden provision in Obamacare taxes sporting goods as medical devices.	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2013/jun/14/chain-email/chain-email-claims-health-care-law-contains-hidden/	PolitiFact started checking claims about the three-year-old Affordable Care Act, the health care law often called Obamacare, before the legislation became law. The checked statements have rated from True to Pants on Fire! on the Truth-O-Meter, but falsehoods have often drowned out the truths.Though some of the law's provisions have gone into effect, and many of its biggest features kick in next year, polls show the public still has a hard time understanding what's in it. We've looked repeatedly at the most persistent claims, and have seen many of them evolve. We at PolitiFact Ohio thought we had a new claim this month, when a reader forwarded a chain email we hadn't seen before. We looked into it, saw it dealt with a subject familiar to us, and found that it has been examined by our friends at the nonpolitical Snopes.com and several other rumor-checking sites. The email is built on a sales receipt from Cabela's, the Nebraska-based outdoor merchandise chain whose locations include Ohio. The receipt, like one posted by Snopes.com, shows a charge for a "medical excise tax." The chain email claims that Cabela's has "refused to hide" the charge, which is "supposed to be hidden from the consumer." It goes on to say that the medical excise tax is "hidden in Obamacare," and that it applies to certain medical devices starting Jan. 1, 2013. Quoting an IRS publication on excise taxes, the email asks: "What do I find under 'medical devices' under 'manufacturers taxes'?" In answer, it lists: "Sport fishing equipment; fishing rods and fishing poles; electric outboard motors; fishing tackle boxes; bows, quivers, broadheads and points; arrow shafts; coal; taxable tires; gas guzzler automobiles, and vaccines." Let's take the parts of the claim separately. First, it is true that there is a 2.3 percent tax on the first sale of certain medical devices in the Affordable Care Act, but it is not hidden. We've done at least six fact-checks about it, starting in October 2009, and it has been cited in numerous print and broadcast ads by opponents of the health care law, including a spot for presidential candidate Mitt Romney. The tax is one of the provisions in the law that offset the added costs of expanding health coverage to the uninsured, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The tax does not apply to eyeglasses, contact lenses, hearing aids, bandages or other medical devices "generally purchased by the general public at retail for individual use," the law states. The tax does not apply to devices made for export. It does apply to imported devices as well as those made domestically. The Internal Revenue Service has posted information about what constitutes a taxable medical device. None of the items listed in the chain email are included. Those items are listed by the IRS as being subject to excise taxes that predate the health care act and have nothing to do with it. Contrary to the emailer's claim, the items are not listed under "medical devices" by the IRS. So why the charge on the receipt from Cabela's? The company earlier gave an explanation to its hometown Scottsbluff Star-Herald newspaper. And it confirmed to us that it was reported accurately. A Cabela's spokesman blamed a companywide "glitch" in its sales register system. The problem added a 2.3 percent "medical excise tax" to all purchases at its stores on Jan. 1. The error was caught the same day, the spokesman said, and the charges would be refunded. Vendors typically use new sales software at the start of a year to handle changes in tax laws, Snopes.com noted. Even though the cost of taxes are typically passed along to consumers, however, the medical device excise tax applies only to manufacturers and importers, not to consumers. Like many chain emails, the one about Cabela’s mixes fact with falsehood. The fact is the existence of the medical device excise tax, effective on Jan. 1, as part of the Affordable Care Act. But there the accuracy ends. The tax is not hidden. It does not apply to consumer products. The emailer’s "proof" of the claim that it does is actually, at best, an erroneous interpretation of an IRS posting on other excise taxes. Finally, Cabela’s told the Star-Herald that its charge was the erroneous result of a software "glitch," and the money would be refunded. The email is not accurate, and its preposterous claim that fishing tackle, tires and gas-guzzling cars are classified as "medical devices" puts it in another category: Pants on Fire!

pomt-02942	"The vast majority of people in this country are keeping their (health insurance) plan."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/29/david-axelrod/david-axelrod-says-vast-majority-americans-will-ke/	It’s the question-du-jour about the new health care law: Are people going to be able to keep their health insurance if they like it? President Barack Obama has several times said yes. But cancellation notices coming in the mail to policyholders tell another story. The contrast between Obama’s promises and what’s playing out in America has led to a fierce political war of words about who lied, who knew what and when, and how Americans will have to deal with the ramifications. Former Obama campaign strategist David Axelrod and Oklahoma Republican Sen. Tom Coburn debated the issue Monday on MSNBC’s Morning Joe. Coburn: "You're no longer eligible to buy your own plan, which was the No. 1 promise that the president made to the American people. You cannot get what you had." Axelrod: "Most people are going to keep their own plans, senator, and you know that." Coburn: "That’s not true." Moments later, Axelrod made his point again: "The majority of people in this country, the vast majority of people in this country, are keeping their plan. People who are uninsured are going to have choices they never had before." In this fact-check, we wanted to dig into what’s happening to the American health insurance system to see what policies are being canceled, how many, why and how you might be affected. A good starting point is to see how Americans get their insurance right now. Using census data, the Kaiser Family Foundation finds that in 2012, a little less than 50 percent of the public got their coverage through an employer-based plan. That is, a business negotiates a contract with an insurance company and offers health coverage to its workers. The second largest group, about 30 percent, gets insurance through either Medicare, Medicaid or both. A third group of people with insurance, about 6 percent, buy policies directly from insurance companies. This is called the individual market. (The remainder of Americans, around 16 percent, are currently uninsured.) The health care law that was passed in 2010 made changes to all three legs of the health insurance stool, but the biggest changes came in the individual market. Before the health care law was passed, the individual market was widely considered a mess. Insurers could turn you down for pre-existing conditions, and none of the insurance was standardized, so if you bought a policy, it wasn’t always crystal clear what you were getting. The law’s goal always had been to get these people into standardized plans that cover a defined list of benefits. As a result, some existing policies did not meet standards set by the new health care law. This is why people in this group may be seeing cancellation notices. Kaiser estimates that 15 million people are in the individual market. They are likely to have a very different experience from the "vast majority" cited by Axelrod. In New Jersey and Florida, hundreds of thousands of people have received cancellation notices and more are popping up across the country. It’s unclear how many people in the individual market will be forced to change their plan. And what happens to people who are will vary. People can buy another plan from the same company or shop around. Some of them will be eligible for government subsidies and some will not. This group is where the disruptions are most likely. Another group of people -- about 90 million -- are covered through through Medicare or Medicaid. While the Affordable Care Act does make changes, most notably in something called the Medicare Advantage program, they are not being moved into new coverage plans. That leaves the nearly 150 million people who get their insurance through the plans their employer offer. Those plans could change. But it’s tough to say how substantially, and how much as a result of the health care law. Part of that is because plans change every year. Still, some companies are making changes to bring costs down. For example, UPS is telling their employees that if their spouse can receive health insurance through a different employer, UPS will no longer offer them coverage. That certainly could mean people are not keeping their health care plan. How much of the blame should be shouldered by the health care law is a different matter. We asked a variety of experts to comment on the literal accuracy of Axelrod’s statement. For the most part, regardless of their opinion of the new health care law, they gave Axelrod the benefit of the doubt. "It’s probably true -- at least for next year," said Gail Wilensky, the former head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H. W. Bush. "Most employers aren’t going to do anything about the insurance they are offering for 2014 because of the Affordable Care Act." "He is absolutely right," said Bob Laszewski, a health insurance consultant and head of Health Policy and Strategy Associates. But Laszweski also said Axelrod was intentionally diverting attention from the real problems taking place in the individual market. Gerard Anderson, director of the Center for Hospital Finance and Management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said, "I would make the same comment that David Axelrod makes but without any real facts. The people with large employers are not really being impacted by the (health care law) and neither are the Medicare and Medicaid recipients." Sabrina Corlette, program director at at Georgetown University’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms, echoed Anderson’s point. For Ted Marmor, a professor of health policy at Yale University, rejected Axelrod’s claim, largely because no one has the hard evidence to back it up or refute it. "No one has the data to be sure," Marmor said. "Axelrod has no authority for his claim. It is a hope." But Marmor is among the minority of the experts we consulted. "It's simply true," said Dan Mendelson, CEO of Avalere Health, a Washington health consulting group. "Most of the lives are in the large corporate customer base and we're seeing virtually no dropping of coverage there." What does it mean to keep your plan? In the view of some analysts, if the plan offered by an employer changes, it is not the same plan and this would make Axelrod wrong. Chris Conover, a critic of Obamacare and an adjunct scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank, said the Affordable Care Act requires that every plan offer certain minimum benefits, such as free preventive care. It also allows children up to age 26 to stay on their parents’ plan. Those and other rules drive up premiums and lead to employers offering different plans. Conover said millions of people "actually have had to purchase more expensive coverage even if they were perfectly happy with their old coverage." Axelrod’s office takes a different view. We contacted them and his staff pointed us to a 2013 survey by the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans. Based on responses from 966 organizations, including firms both small and large, the survey found that 94 percent were definitely or very likely to continue to offer coverage. In that sense, the majority of Americans would still get insurance through their employer. Still, in the survey, about half of the companies estimated Obamacare would raise costs in the range of 1 to 4 percent. Many businesses, in the range of 30 to 40 percent overall, planned to increase the employee share of premiums, raise their deductibles and in other ways shift costs to workers. But it is important to remember that cost and risk shifting has been with the country for a long time. The Kaiser Family Foundation annual survey of employer plans reports that in the past 10 years, the average share of premiums paid by employees has gone up and the fraction of workers in high-deductible plans has risen steadily since 2006, reaching one fifth of the people in the study in 2013. Richard Zirkelbach, a spokesman for America’s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group of insurance companies, said the impact of the health care law takes place within an insurance marketplace that has been far from static. "There have been year to year changes to policies," Zirkelbach said. Of all the factors that drive those changes -- rising medical costs, changes in the health of the people in the insurance pool, and government regulation -- Zirkelbach believes the Affordable Care Act rules are having the largest impact as employers look to 2014. Zirkelbach points especially to the minimum requirements for every insurance plan. The employee benefit survey reports that about three quarters of all plans meet all minimum requirements and need no further changes. Our ruling Axelrod said the vast majority of people are keeping their health care plans. That’s certainly what the 2010 health care law intended. The law was crafted largely to leave in place the health care delivery systems for people who get health insurance either through their employer (about 50 percent of people with insurance) or through the government-managed Medicare or Medicaid programs (about 30 percent). Some changes may be occurring in the employer market that would stop people from keeping the health care plans they have. But the bigger issues are in the so-called individual market, which accounts for about 6 percent of Americans who now have health care. The health care law, in essence, raises standards that will make many plans offered in the individual market obsolete. Experts told us there is no precise data to determine how many people will be forced to change health care plans, but they generally agreed the number will be small this year. The broad consensus is that, for the time being, most people will see changes in their coverage and what they pay for that coverage consistent with changes they have seen with their insurance over the past decade.

pomt-04609	"Since 2000, only 10 cases of in-person voter fraud have been proven nationally."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2012/sep/19/naacp/-person-voter-fraud-very-rare-phenomenon/	With less than two months to November’s presidential election, voter laws have taken center stage. The latest area of contention is Pennsylvania, where the outcome of the state’s new voter identification law is before that state’s Supreme Court. Pennsylvania’s law, signed into law by Gov. Tom Corbett in March, follows similar laws in states such as Georgia, and it is scheduled to take effect in time for the November general election. Pennsylvania’s law would require voters to show an official ID -- including a state driver’s license, government employee ID or a state nondriver ID card -- to cast a ballot. Thirty-one states have laws in place that will require all voters to show ID at the polls this November, according to the National Conference of State Legislators. As in other states, supporters say the law is necessary to combat voter fraud; opponents say the new law disenfranchises poor, minority and elderly voters who are less likely to have the approved IDs. Opponents also say the voter ID laws are unnecessary because the voter fraud used to justify the laws doesn’t exist. Politifact has done extensive research on the issue of voter ID laws and the impact on voters and Election Day turnout. The NAACP, working with a variety of civil rights groups opposing the state’s law, held a news conference in Philadelphia last week warning about the possible negative impact the voter ID law could have on Pennsylvania’s eligible voters. In an announcement about the news conference, the NAACP said that "Since 2000, only 10 cases of in-person voter fraud have been proven nationally." That number the organization used is very specific for a 12-year period. The NAACP figure deals only with "in-person voter fraud." And only with cases that have been "proven." This type of voter fraud, experts say, is extremely rare. PolitiFact Georgia wondered how the civil rights organization had arrived at its conclusion. What was the criteria examined for the voter fraud cases? How was the fraud proved or disproved? And is the number correct? We asked the NAACP about the basis for its claim and found that the group used statistics from a nationwide analysis of 2,068 cases alleging election fraud that were reviewed by News21, a Carnegie-Knight investigative reporting project staffed by college journalism students. Results of News21’s seven-month analysis were released in August. The claim made involves a narrow type of election fraud, in-person voter fraud, that voter ID laws are intended to prevent. The News21 team defined that type of fraud as that involving individuals who vote in person on Election Day by impersonating another registered voter. To get the data, News21 reporters sent records requests to elections officers in all 50 states seeking every case of fraudulent elections activity, including registration fraud, absentee ballot fraud, voter impersonation fraud and casting an ineligible vote. News21 said it received no useful responses from several states. With some states, including Massachusetts, Oklahoma, South Carolina and South Dakota, the cases included in the database came from a survey of alleged election fraud conducted by the Republican National Lawyers Association. And in some states, some but not all local jurisdictions responded, and some responses were missing important details about each case. Despite those issues, News21 defends its work as "substantially complete" as the largest collection of election fraud cases gathered by anyone in the country. After compiling all the information into an election fraud database, News21 found that 207 cases of other types of election fraud existed for every case of voter impersonation. "It’s difficult to study the issue of impersonation fraud, which I understood [from the News21 case analysis] to be really just allegations," said Michael McDonald, an associate professor in the department of public and international affairs at George Mason University whose electoral system research was compiled as The United States Elections Project. "Still, yes, it’s plausible and occasionally people have done it. ... But by all accounts it’s a very rare phenomenon." In Georgia, for example, News21’s database includes 301 cases of reported election fraud and no cases of voter impersonation. Twenty-three total election fraud cases were listed for Pennsylvania; none were for voter impersonation. The data compiled by the News21 project have been used widely by various civil rights groups and cited in several news articles as the issue of election requirements -- specifically voter ID laws -- has intensified. For the most part, the News21 analysis has been unchallenged, with the exception of the Republican National Lawyers Association, which has supported voter ID laws. News21 began gathering data in January by reviewing about 375 cases of alleged voter fraud collected by the RNLA. The News21 analysis found that the RNLA cases consisted mainly of newspaper articles about various election issues with little supporting evidence of actual in-person voter fraud. In an email response to PolitiFact Georgia, Michael Thielen, the RNLA’s executive director, classified News21’s analysis involving the in-person voter fraud cases as "highly flawed in its very approach to the issue." And, by stating that voter impersonation is the only type of election fraud that voter ID laws could prevent, the News21 report was result-driven, attempting to prove that voter ID is not necessary, Thielen said. Thielen and the RNLA maintain that voter ID laws would prevent several types of election fraud, including voting in multiple states, noncitizen voting and voting in multiple jurisdictions within a state. He referenced the RNLA’s December 2011 Vote Fraud State Survey, a compilation of limited searches for election law crimes within the 50 states in recent years. The RNLA is working on a detailed response to News21’s report, Thielen said. The NAACP’s claim -- actually, News21’s -- that only 10 provable cases of voter impersonation have occurred in the country in the past dozen years is based on extensive analysis and data received from the actual elections officials in charge of handling these issues. Without doing a repeat of the 50-state data collection and review, it is impossible to re-create the same type of research. Supporters of the voter ID laws, including the RNLA, still defend them. But the RNLA’s own research alleging that more cases of fraud exist than the News21 claim includes several other types of election fraud, not just voter impersonation. The NAACP’s claim, and in turn News21’s, appears mostly accurate, with an extensive database supporting it. There are a few missing pieces, however, in the data. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-02079	Obamacare is "one big fat VA system."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/may/22/kimberly-guilfoyle/guilfoyle-obamacare-one-big-fat-va/	The uproar over allegations of secret waiting lists at a Veterans Administration hospital in Phoenix, and delays that potentially cost veterans their lives has opened the Obama administration to criticism that it was slow to respond to the VA’s own internal reports. Some also see a connection between troubles at the VA and the president’s signature health care law, the Affordable Care Act. On Fox News’ The Five, four of the show’s pundits built the case that if Obama digs deeply into the VA, it will raise more questions than he would like about how the Affordable Care Act is structured. When a Fox News panelist described the VA as a "single-payer" system (where the financing of health care is run through the government), co-host Kimberly Guilfoyle chimed in. "If he (Obama) shines a light on that, if we actually have some illumination there, then you're going to see this is really what the rest of you all are going to get: One big fat VA system in the form of Obamacare," Guilfoyle said. Using the same logic, co-host Eric Bolling later claimed that 500 people per year "are going to die waiting" for treatment because of Obamacare. Bolling’s claim has some fundamental problems -- we’ll address them in a bit -- but here we’re fact-checking Guilfoyle’s claim that Obamacare amounts to "one big fat VA system." Obamacare: One big fat VA system The VA owns hospitals. Its doctors, nurses and technicians are government employees. The people who get care at VA facilities have served in the armed forces. These facilities are not open to the general public, and Congress appropriates the funds that keep the VA running. Under the Affordable Care Act, the government works with private insurance companies and health care providers to provide health care coverage. The government subsidizes insurance premiums for some people and sets minimum standards for insurance policies. But the health care system remains in the private sector. Private sector providers get paid by insurance companies and patients. There are thousands of private providers and hundreds of insurance plans operating in hundreds of markets across the country. In the case of Medicaid, the government plays the role of the insurance company and pays private providers based on a set reimbursement schedule. Some notes about the Affordable Care Act: Employers will continue to provide health insurance to the majority of Americans through private insurance companies. The government has not seized control of hospitals or nationalized doctors. The law does not include the public option, a government-run insurance plan that would have competed with private insurers. We asked health care experts to assess the similarities and differences between the VA and the Affordable Care Act. The bottom line: it’s apples and oranges. Tom Buchmueller, who spent a year on Obama's Council of Economic Advisors and teaches at the University of Michigan, said he struggles to see any similarity at all. "Coverage through the exchanges is private insurance," Buchmueller said. Tom Getzen at Temple University said the VA is much like the institution that the veterans were once part of. "It’s an army," Getzen said. "In contrast, Obamacare is a complex legislative creation (with) the exchanges, expanded Medicaid and regulation." Getzen said, to call Obamacare the same as the VA "is kind of like saying your farm program is a post office." They both have government ties, but they’re fundamentally different and are operated differently. Scott Harrington, an adjunct scholar with the conseravtive American Enterprise Institute and a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School, described the changes under Obamacare as a step in the direction of a government-run health care system. "But it’s a long way from getting there," Harrington said. The idea that the Affordable Care Act was a "government takeover of health care" was named as PolitiFact’s 2010 Lie of the Year. 500 people dying a year from Obamacare Bolling took the comparison a step further, saying the sort of delays that took place at the VA in Phoenix would repeat themselves under Obamacare, with 500 people dying a year as a result. "President Obama wanted to insure 40 million new people under Obamacare," Bolling said. At the VA, he continued, the typical veteran has 13 appointments each year. Bolling applied that to 40 million new patients. "You're talking 585 million visits, half a billion visits," Bolling said. "If people are dying, how many people are going to die in Obamacare? Do the math. It will be about 500 people per year that are going to die waiting -- apples to apples." While we won’t fact-check Bolling’s prediction, we do think it’s important to point out two problems with Bolling’s math for people who saw the segment. First, the Congressional Budget Office projects that through 2024, 26 million people will gain coverage under the Affordable Care Act. So Bolling exaggerated the base number by about 50 percent. Second, the experts we reached said veterans have very different needs than the general population. Part of the massive growth in the VA workload stemmed from disorders related to traumatic brain injury and from the lingering effects of the Vietnam War defoliant Agent Orange. Bolling doubled or even tripled the number of doctor appointments of typical Americans, experts told us. "The average in the U.S. is between four and six," Getzen said. The U.S. Census Bureau reports that the average number of visits fell from 4.8 a year in 2001 to 3.9 in 2010. Point being: The math Bolling used to reach his prediction is quite flawed. Our ruling Guilfoyle said Obamacare is "one big fat VA system." We found no health policy expert who agreed with that comparison. The VA is owned and operated by the federal government. Its staff are government employees. In contrast, Obamacare builds upon the existing private sector health industry. The law sets standards for insurance and health care providers and it subsidizes premiums. Washington does run the Medicaid insurance program but even under that program, it is paying private providers. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-03964	"I was the first member of Congress to call him (Barack Obama) a socialist..."	false	/georgia/statements/2013/feb/15/paul-broun/broun-touts-pinning-socialist-label-obama/	U.S. Rep. Paul Broun has never been known as a wilting flower. During his time in the U.S. House, the Georgia Republican has become known for his strong, conservative opinions and controversial statements involving evolution. Those strong positions were on full display in a recent fundraising letter to donors that surfaced this week. In soliciting funds for his run for the Senate seat being vacated by Saxby Chambliss, Broun criticized President Barack Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and alleged their policies are ruining the country. "I was the first member of Congress to call him a socialist who embraces Marxist-Leninist policies like government control of health care and redistribution of wealth," Broun says of Obama in the letter. PolitiFact Georgia sets the bar high when someone says they’re the "first" to make a particular statement, so we researched the claim to see if Broun’s bar should be lowered. Stories about Broun’s letter were published earlier this week by other news outlets and political pundits across the state. The conservative political blog Georgia Tipsheet called the letter "a predictably confrontational fundraising appeal" and noted that Broun was among the earliest to attach the (socialist) barb to Obama. The liberal blog Daily Kos called Broun’s letter "crackpot haiku." In August 2009, Broun told an audience at North Georgia Technical College that Obama -- along with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Reid -- were members of a "socialist elite," while deriding Obamacare (what critics call the national health care law). Then, in January 2011, after Obama delivered his State of the Union address, Broun said in a Twitter post that the president did not believe in the Constitution, and instead "You believe in socialism." Broun compared Obama’s policies to those of Hitler or a Marxist dictator in November 2008, but apologized a week later for making the statements. "The point I tried to make is that he is extremely liberal, he has promoted a lot of socialistic ideas, and it just makes me concerned," Broun told an Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter at the time. Obama’s socialist moniker doesn’t stop with Broun. In October 2008, then-Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain accused Obama of pursuing a "socialist" agenda for telling blue-collar worker Joe the Plumber during a campaign stop that spreading the wealth around is good for everybody. That same month, then-Ohio U.S. Sen. George Voinovich told a newspaper reporter, "(Obama) is left of Teddy Kennedy. With all due respect, the man is a socialist." PolitiFact has examined before whether Obama is a socialist, a claim made by Texas Gov. Rick Perry. We ruled that claim Pants on Fire. But we’re ruling on a different claim here: whether Broun was the first to place the "socialist" label on the president. So was Broun’s claim accurate? We called and emailed questions about the letter to Broun’s staff for comment, but received no response. PolitiFact Georgia found that Broun’s socialist name-calling goes back to 2009 when he said the president was a member of the "socialist elite," and in 2011 said the president believed in socialism. But one of Broun’s congressional colleagues, Sen. George Voinovich of Ohio, called Obama a socialist in October 2008; and Sen. John McCain of Arizona criticized Obama’s "socialist" agenda during that same month. Based on our research, Broun was not the first member of Congress to specifically call Obama a socialist. In November 2008, Broun did compare Obama’s policies to those of Hitler or a Marxist dictator. Philosopher Karl Marx is described historically as a revolutionary socialist, and Hitler was head of the National Socialist German Workers Party. But even that criticism was made a month after other congressional members lobbed their socialist charges. Congress consists of both the U.S. House and U.S. Senate, and Obama was called a "socialist" by an Ohio senator a year before Broun actually used the term "socialist." We rated Broun’s claim False.

pomt-13635	"(Paul Ryan) has actually proposed three — total, three — bills that have become law in his entire career dating back to 1999."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/aug/10/david-canon/professor-house-speaker-paul-ryan-has-only-propose/	Even after endorsing Donald Trump, House Speaker Paul Ryan continues to wrestle with the divide between him and his party’s presidential nominee. "We’re different people," Ryan, who is from Janesville, told reporters at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. "There are different kinds of conservatives." While Trump appeals to emotions, Ryan tends to be cast as the GOP’s policy wonk. But in a July 9, 2016 New York Times article, the chairman of the University of Wisconsin’s political science department suggested Ryan’s reputation may be overblown. Why? Few of his plans ever become law. "(Ryan) has actually proposed three — total, three — bills that have become law in his entire career dating back to 1999," David Canon was quoted as saying. "Paul Ryan is not a detail kind of legislator in terms of putting bills together to pass, and he never has been. "He is an ideas guy." When Ryan announced his endorsement of Trump, he wrote that the first step in setting policy agenda is "putting it on paper and having a real debate." In making his claim, Canon suggested Ryan doesn’t follow his own advice — or hasn’t had much success with it. Let’s take a look. Bills, bills, bills The article listed three bills proposed by Ryan that became law: "One named a post office in Wisconsin, a second changed taxes on arrows used by deer hunters, and the third, this year, established a $3 million presidential commission on ‘evidence-based policy making.’ " A visit to Ryan’s profile at Congress.gov shows — when filtered by "Sponsored Legislation" and "Became Law" — the same three bills referenced in the article. While Canon was quoted as saying Ryan proposed only three bills, he told us he was referring to bills "sponsored" by Ryan. "Sponsoring a bill is very different than co-sponsoring a bill," Canon wrote in an email. "Many bills that become law have a hundred or more cosponsors, so bill sponsorship is the meaningful indicator of the member of Congress who had primary influence on determining the content of a bill." According to Congress.gov, Ryan has sponsored 109 pieces of legislation and co-sponsored 1,067. Of those, 83 became law. New York Times reporter Jackie Calmes said it was clear from their conversation that Canon was referencing sponsored bills, and the statement’s context in the article reflects that. But Ryan’s camp challenged how Canon assessed Ryan’s tenure. "Any realistic look at (Ryan’s) record will clearly show the claim that Paul has only passed three bills is objectively wrong," said spokesman Ian Martorana. He references three particular items not included in the count, all of which Ryan helped write: Murray-Ryan Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 Trade Promotion Authority legislation in 2015 Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, in which Ryan authored disability insurance reforms For four years, Ryan also chaired the House Budget Committee, which wrote and passed a nonbinding resolution each year, Martorana said. Jennifer Victor, a professor of political science at George Mason University and an expert on Congress, said while Ryan has only personally sponsored three bills that became law, bill passage is not necessarily a good indicator of effectiveness as a legislator. "Some legislators may be very active in a policy area, but rarely see enactment," she wrote in an email. "Think of someone who introduces many bills, perhaps symbolically, and they all die in committee or get voted down on the floor." While this legislator hasn’t changed the law, he or she might have generated attention for a topic. Measuring impact based only on the bills a lawmaker solely sponsors also introduces issues, Victor said. Early cosponsors can be heavily involved in the bill’s content and committee chairs, while they don’t necessarily write more bills, often serve as facilitators. A better indicator of effectiveness, Victor said, is a tool developed by two professors that measures a lawmaker relative to his or her peers. It takes into account the content of a lawmaker’s bills and how far the bills moved. Policy bills, for example, increase a lawmaker’s score more than commemorative bills. But it only looks at solely sponsored bills, which does not necessarily give the full picture of a lawmaker’s impact. By this tool, Ryan comes off as more effective, though his effectiveness is below the benchmark expectation for all but one two-year period since 1999. The expectation is calculated based on his party, tenure and specific committee and subcommittee positions he has held. Our rating Canon told the New York Times that Ryan "has actually proposed three — total, three — bills that have become law in his entire career dating back to 1999." Canon was referring to bills Ryan solely sponsored and is on target by that measure. But the claim suggests Ryan has been an unproductive lawmaker. Another tool out there provides a better view, but — like Canon — ignores legislation Ryan helped author but didn’t solely sponsor. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/92a76b05-8d40-4be1-a98d-32bb0f903f19	None	David Canon	None	None	None	2016-08-10T05:00:00	2016-07-09	['None']
pomt-00613	A 50-50 public-private split for paying for a new Milwaukee Bucks arena would "be much better -- in terms of the portion of the public financing -- than most of the other arena projects done around the country."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/may/29/tim-sheehy/would-paying-half-cost-new-milwaukee-bucks-arena-b/	News broke on May 27, 2015 that an agreement was close on how to pay for a new $500 million arena for the Milwaukee Bucks, the basketball team that Kareem Abdul-Jabbar once led to glory. Some details of the proposed arrangement between the Bucks and state and local government officials were new. But the overall cost sharing was, more or less, what had long been expected: The Bucks’ owners would pay half and taxpayers would pay half. According to Tim Sheehy, president of the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce, such a split would be good for taxpayers. Here is what he said April 10, 2015 on "Here and Now," a Wisconsin Public Television show: "If this comes out close to a 50-50 partnership, it will be much better -- in terms of the portion of the public financing -- than most of the other arena projects done around the country." In other words, Sheehy, who supports the new arena, is saying that taxpayers picking up half the tab for a new Milwaukee arena is relatively low, compared to how much taxpayers have contributed toward arenas for other National Basketball Association teams. The parties set a self-imposed deadline of May 29, 2015 to try and finalize the financing deal, which would have to be approved, likely within the next few weeks, as part of the 2015-’17 state budget. So, let’s take a look. The Bucks and their arenas The Bucks joined the NBA in the 1968-’69 season. Led by Abdul-Jabbar and another future Hall of Famer, Oscar Robertson, they won their only league championship in the 1970-’71 season. That, according to the team, meant the Bucks went further, faster, than any expansion team in the history of major professional sports. In recent years, however, the Bucks have struggled, and that is one reason there has been a drive to build a new arena. The team’s current home -- the $90 million BMO Harris Bradley Center, which was built through a donation by the late Milwaukee philanthropist Jane Bradley Pettit -- opened in 1988. The 18,600-seat arena is the third-oldest and the third-smallest in the 30-team NBA. Momentum for a new arena picked up in April 2014, when the Bucks’ longtime owner, former U.S. Sen. Herb Kohl of Milwaukee, announced he was selling the team to New York hedge-fund investors Marc Lasry and Wesley Edens. Kohl and the new owners pledged to contribute $250 million toward a new arena. Coming up with the other $250 million has been the sticking point, leading to months of negotiations involving Gov. Scott Walker, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett and Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele. There is time pressure in that the NBA has said a new arena must be built by the fall of 2017, or Milwaukee would risk losing the team to another market. Other arena deals To see how other NBA arenas have been financed, we turned to two sources: The 2012 edition of "Financing Economic Development in the 21st Century," a textbook that includes a chapter on financing professional sports facilities. And a database, last updated in August 2014, that is maintained by Marquette University Law School’s National Sports Law Institute. We’ve listed the 15 NBA arenas -- comprising half the arenas in the league -- that have been built since 1999. We went back to 1999 because a wave of NBA arenas -- seven of them -- went up that year. As we’ll see, there is some disagreement between the figures provided by the textbook and by Marquette. Holy Cross College sports economist Victor Matheson, who wrote the sports facilities chapter in the textbook, told us that’s not surprising because there are different ways to define a public contribution and because stadium financing deals aren’t always transparent. Based on the two sources we checked, at least eight of the 15 NBA arenas built since 1999 were financed with more than 50 percent taxpayer support. Indeed, although there is some variation in the figures in the two sources, seven of the eight arenas were built with at least 82 percent public money (the total cost figures are according to the textbook). Arenas built with more than 50% public money NBA city Year arena built Total cost Portion paid by taxpayers per the texbook Portion paid by taxpayers per Marquette Orlando 2010 $480 million 90% 87.5% Charlotte 2005 $265 million 100% 100% Memphis 2004 $250 million 100% 83% Houston 2003 $235 million 82% 100% San Antonio 2002 $186 million 85% 84% Oklahoma City 2002 $89 million 100% 100% Miami 1999 $213 million 100% 59% New Orleans 1999 $114 million 100% 100% Conversely, the textbook and Marquette agree that only four of the arenas were built with taxpayer contributions of 50 percent or less. Arenas built with 50% or less public money NBA city Year arena built Total cost Portion paid by taxpayers per the textbook Portion paid by taxpayers per Marquette Dallas 2001 $420 million 50% 30% Toronto 1999 $265 million 0% 0% Denver 1999 $160 million 22% 3% Los Angeles 1999 $375 million 16% 19% There was not agreement between the between the two sources on the public portion paid for arenas in Brooklyn, Indianapolis and Atlanta: NBA city Year arena built Total cost Portion paid by taxpayers per the texbook Portion paid by taxpayers per Marquette Indianapolis 1999 $183 million 100% 43% Atlanta 1999 $214 million 29% 91% Brooklyn 2010 $637 million 24% N/A Our rating Sheehy said a 50-50 public-private split for paying for a new Milwaukee Bucks arena would "be much better in terms of the portion of the public financing than most of the other arena projects done around the country." Of the 15 NBA arenas -- comprising half the cities in the league -- built since 1999, at least eight were built with more than 50 percent of the money coming from taxpayers. Seven of those eight were built with at least 82 percent public money. We rate his statement True.	None	Tim Sheehy	None	None	None	2015-05-29T14:40:19	2015-04-10	['None']
pomt-05727	Says State Comptroller Matthew Boxer "pointed out that many towns are artificially lowering the real estate values that they report to Trenton" in order to "get hundreds of millions of dollars of additional school aid. This is the kind of fraud that needs to be addressed immediately."	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/mar/05/michael-doherty/michael-doherty-claims-new-jersey-towns-are-artifi/	State Sen. Michael Doherty wants to see action taken immediately to address what he considers a fraudulent practice in many New Jersey municipalities where property values are being lowered to secure more school aid from the state. In a Feb. 28 interview on NJToday, Doherty claimed that activity was documented in a report issued by the state comptroller. "And the other one was a report by our state comptroller, Matthew Boxer, and he pointed out that many towns are artificially lowering the real estate values that they report to Trenton, and they do that because that also means they get hundreds of millions of dollars of additional school aid," Doherty (R-Warren) said. "This is the kind of fraud that needs to be addressed immediately." Fraud? Money? PolitiFact New Jersey was intrigued. But after reviewing the comptroller’s August 2010 report, we found that Doherty is exaggerating its findings. The comptroller’s report shows that some municipalities "artificially" reduce property tax collections through the use of tax abatements, possibly leading to the increased need for school aid, according to the report. However, tax abatements are allowed under state law and don’t represent an act of "fraud." Also, while such abatements may indirectly generate additional school aid, their purpose is to attract investment to areas in need of redevelopment or rehabilitation. First, let’s explain what a tax abatement is. Through tax abatements, municipalities reduce or eliminate property tax bills for certain landowners, who are typically businesses and developers. In the case of long-term abatements, property owners are exempt from paying taxes, but must contribute so-called "payments in lieu of taxes," or PILOTs. But none of that PILOT money goes to the local school districts, which also are losing the property tax revenue. As a result, such tax abatements may increase the need for state aid, according to the comptroller’s report. "The school district still needs the state aid at the enhanced level since the district itself does not see the benefit of the PILOT amounts, and taxpayers throughout the state pay the resulting bill," according to the report. So, Doherty is correct that tax abatements may result in sending more school aid to those communities. But we found two problems with Doherty’s characterization of tax abatements. First, Doherty’s "fraud" claim suggests that such practices are somehow illegal. The comptroller’s report raises multiple concerns about the tax abatement process, but still indicates that such tax exemptions are permitted under state law. Secondly, Doherty suggested that the purpose of tax abatements was to generate additional school aid. But tax abatements are meant to "encourage rehabilitation and redevelopment of distressed areas," according to the comptroller’s report. The increase in municipal revenue through PILOTs also was cited by some officials "as a motivation to grant abatements," the report states. The comptroller’s report does not claim the purpose of tax abatements is to receive more school aid, according to Peter McAleer, spokesman for the comptroller’s office. McAleer told us that determining such a purpose "would require reading the minds of those who grant the abatements, and it’s impossible to make an across-the-board conclusion about the state of mind of hundreds of different local officials." But Doherty argued that municipalities are manipulating the numbers and school districts are using the low real estate values as justification for demanding greater school aid. "So my statement is 100 percent accurate," Doherty told us. "I see the big picture...I see how it affects the school funding formula and the distribution of school aid." Our ruling In an NJToday interview, Doherty said, according to the comptroller’s report, many municipalities are "artificially lowering" real estate values to secure more school aid, a practice he referred to as "fraud." The senator is right that tax abatements may lead to greater school aid in communities with these tax-exempt properties. But he’s wrong to claim those practices constitute "fraud," and that their direct purpose is to generate additional school aid. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-10690	"He's (Romney) the one who said that he would be to the left of Teddy Kennedy on gay rights."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/11/rudy-giuliani/he-didnt-say-that-but-he-did-shift-to-the-left/	While Romney never said he was "to the left of Teddy Kennedy on gay rights," Romney did reach out to gay and lesbian voters during his failed 1994 bid for Kennedy's Senate seat. More to the point, Romney said he could outperform Kennedy on gay and lesbian issues. In an October 1994 letter to the Massachusetts chapter of the Log Cabin Republicans, a GOP gay rights group, Romney wrote, "For some voters it might be enough for me to simply match my opponent's record in this area. But I believe we can and must do better." And during an August 1994 question and answer session with the Boston gay and lesbian newspaper Bay Windows, Romney said he could be a more effective advocate for gay rights than Kennedy because he is a Republican. "When Ted Kennedy speaks on gay rights, he's seen as an extremist. When Mitt Romney speaks on gay rights he's seen as a centrist and a moderate," he said. By 2002, when Romney defeated Democrat Shannon O'Brien to become Massachusetts' governor, he had backed off his support of gay rights. O'Brien said she would support legislation to legalize gay marriage, while Romney said he would not. After Romney won the election, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled in 2004 that gays and lesbians must be allowed to marry in Massachusetts, making it the first state to confer that right. Romney fought it every step of the way. While he didn't say that he would "be to the left of Teddy Kennedy on gay rights," he did say he would be a more effective gay rights advocate than Kennedy because of his centrist/moderate stance. So apart from the license he takes with Romney's wording, Giuliani's attack is Mostly True and demonstrates just how far Romney has shifted to the right since his first foray into politics in 1994.

pomt-10756	"Dodd brought both parties together to pass the Family and Medical Leave Act."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/30/chris-dodd/dodd-was-bulldog-in-passing-bill/	In a new TV ad, two barbers (actually Chicago actors) who like Chris Dodd give him credit for winning bipartisan support to pass the Family and Medical Leave Act. We find the claim is accurate. Dodd first introduced the bill in 1985 and it became law in 1993, more than seven years later. It allows workers to take up to twelve weeks of unpaid leave for the birth or adoption of a child or the illness of a close family member. It's fair for Dodd to say that he had to work hard to get the bill passed. It was stymied by a Republican filibuster in the Senate in 1988. It fared better in 1990, passing both chambers, but the first President Bush vetoed it. The veto was sustained, and the issue was off the table for the session. Later, in 1991, Dodd found a critical ally in Republican Sen. Christopher S. Bond of Missouri. They negotiated changes that would make the legislation more palatable to the business community and bring on more Republicans. The bill cleared in 1992, only to be vetoed again by Bush. Again, the veto was not overridden. Finally, in 1993 the legislation cleared for the third time and President Clinton signed it into law. It took compromise to allay the fears of the business community and get enough Republicans to support it. When it passed, the States News Service quoted Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill. saying "Dodd has been a bulldog on this."	None	Chris Dodd	None	None	None	2007-10-30T00:00:00	2007-11-05	['None']
pomt-06748	"We rank below Ethiopia, I'm told, in terms of our exports per capita, well below any of the other developed countries we trade with, and well below China and (South) Korea."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2011/aug/25/rob-portman/sen-rob-portman-says-us-export-values-capita-lag-e/	Ohio's Sen. Rob Portman is a former United States trade ambassador who supports more trade agreements to increase U.S. exports. In a recent interview with Charlie Rose on PBS, the senator said the U.S. "should be the largest exporter in the world, which we are in many categories, but also per capita. We are well behind all of our trading partners." Not only behind trading partners, he said: "We rank below Ethiopia, I'm told, in terms of our exports per capita, well below any of the other developed countries we trade with, and well below China and (South) Korea and countries we hope to trade with more, in the case of Korea through the Korean trade agreement." When Portman made a similar statement early this year, saying that U.S. trade lags behind other developed nations, PolitiFact Ohio rated it as True. We found that the United States trails only Germany and China in terms of merchandise shipped abroad, but that U.S. exports are a smaller portion of the overall economy. The value of U.S. exports in relation to the nation's gross domestic product ranks near the bottom of a list of more than 200 exporting countries compiled by the World Bank. Portman cited a different measure, exports per capita, on PBS. Knowing his expertise in international trade, PolitiFact Ohio again wanted to know more. We looked at figures from the CIA World Factbook and were surprised at what we found. U.S. exports per capita (about $3,400 in 2009) were less than half of South Korea's ($7,700), just as Portman said. But U.S. exports were substantially more per capita than China's ($899) and spectacularly more than Ethiopia's ($19). We asked Portman's office for clarification, and were told the senator "was referring to the GDP number" on PBS. Portman referred more than once to "exports per capita." But PolitiFact Ohio does understand slips of the tongue, and Portman clearly has expertise on this issue. When we substituted "percentage of GDP" for "per capita" -- a substitution only suggested by our checking with his office -- his statement on PBS is accurate about China and South Korea, but not about Ethiopia. By a slim margin, exports from Ethiopia are a smaller percentage of GDP (11 percent) than are U.S. exports (13 percent) on the World Bank list. So where does that leave us? Portman's underlying point remains that U.S. exports lag behind other countries. Yet even allowing that he misspoke on the terms for his comparison, he still is off point on one of his examples. His statement is partially accurate, but sorting it out requires knowing some important details. On the Truth-O-Meter, that makes it Half True.

pomt-12358	"The Earth is 6,000 years old, that’s a fact."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/jun/08/jesse-kremer/republican-wisconsin-lawmaker-wrongly-states-its-f/	During a May 11, 2017 hearing on his bill to create tougher penalties for college students who disrupt public speakers, Wisconsin state Rep. Jesse Kremer, R-Kewaskum, had this exchange with state Rep. Terese Berceau, D-Madison: Berceau: So, my question is, if a geology student says, "I’m sorry, but the Earth is only 6,000 years old" -- rejecting science that says that the Earth is considerably older than that -- is it not OK for a professor to tell that student that they’re wrong? Kremer: So, this bill stays out of the classroom. Yes, the Earth is 6,000 years old, that’s a fact. But, we can discuss that outside of this room. (He chuckles.) Berceau: You said that it is a fact, you do believe it’s a fact? Kremer: Yeah, I do. While the idea that the Earth is 6,000 years old is an article of faith for some, in this context Kremer presented it as a knowable fact. Let’s take a look. Kremer and his bills Kremer, who represents a rural area northwest of Milwaukee, is known for proposing legislation that is, in his words, "red meat for conservatives". For example, to ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy; place gender restrictions on school bathrooms and locker rooms; and allow concealed carry permit-holders to carry guns on public school grounds and college campuses. Kremer introduced the speech bill six days before the hearing, which was held by a state Assembly committee. It would require the state’s Board of Regents to adopt a policy for Wisconsin’s public colleges that includes "a range of disciplinary sanctions for anyone under an institution's jurisdiction who engages in violent, abusive, indecent, profane, boisterous, obscene, unreasonably loud, or other disorderly conduct that interferes with the free expression of others." A student violator could face a one-semester suspension or expulsion for a second offense. The bill, which is expected to be taken up by the Assembly in June 2017, comes as free speech issues have grown more contentious on college campuses across the country, fostering concerns among Republicans that conservative speakers aren’t treated equally. The Capital Times reported on Kremer’s 6,000 statement from the hearing on June 7, 2017, triggering national news stories. Coincidentally, the same day, scientists reported on the discovery of fossils in Morocco that date back roughly 300,000 years, indicating that mankind evolved earlier than had been known. The scientific consensus is that the Earth itself is much older than that. The Earth’s age The topic never seems to get old. 2014: Facebook posts about two Republican U.S. senators and former presidential candidates claimed in part that Marco Rubio of Florida believes the Earth is 9,000 years old and that Rand Paul of Kentucky believes it is 10,000 years old. Neither had made such statements, and PolitiFact National’s rating on the posts was Pants on Fire. 2015: A talk that then-GOP presidential candidate Ben Carson gave four years earlier made news. He had said in 2011: "I am not a hard-and-fast person who says the Earth is only 6,000 years old," but, "I do believe in the six-day creation." 2017: The Washington Post’s Dear Science column answered the question: How do we know how old the Earth is? The answer: "Scientists now know the Earth is actually 4.54 billion years old, an age built on many lines of evidence from the geologic record." Smithsonian.com and the scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey (based on very old rocks, of course) also say around 4.5 billion. But Kremer is far from alone in his belief. The 6,000 figure Many attribute the 6,000 figure to James Ussher (1581–1656), an Irish archbishop who concluded that Adam was created in 4004 B.C. He made his calculation, in part, by counting the number of generations in the Bible. An Institute for Creation Research article says, however, that the work in which Ussher made the estimate contains 12,000 footnotes from secular sources, as well as 2,000 references from the Bible, indicating, the article says, that most of his evidence was non-biblical. And the magazine Wired once observed: Ussher was far from the first person to wildly miscalculate the universe’s age ….Among others to try their hand were Johannes Kepler and Isaac Newton, both of whom arrived at estimates younger than Ussher’s. All labored without a number of modern tools — not only for measuring radioactive decay or rates of the universal expansion, but an intellectual framework for conceiving of time on scales beyond the biblical. That wouldn’t exist for another century, when a Scottish farmer and geological enthusiast named James Hutton, looking at riverbank stone formations, saw a record of sedimentary deposition that couldn’t be contained in 6,000 years. Or many times that. That was a radical idea, and it took another century to be widely accepted, even in the scientific community. Kremer told us his statement is based on his "deeply held religious beliefs, and thus First Amendment freedom of religion and expression, can be found here based on sound biblical and historical evidence." He pointed us to an AnswersInGenesis.org article that also cites Ussher and concludes in part: Cultures around the world give an age of the Earth that confirms what the Bible teaches. Radiometric dates, on the other hand, have been shown to be wildly in error. The age of the Earth ultimately comes down to a matter of trust — it’s a worldview issue. But geology and environmental science professor Nelson Ham at St. Norbert University, a Catholic college in De Pere, Wis., told us: "Kremer's statement is certainly not a scientific fact," noting the many estimates of around 4.5 billion years. "Determining that age has come from measurements that are testable and repeatable, following the scientific method." Our rating Kremer says: "The Earth is 6,000 years old, that’s a fact." Kremer states a biblical belief, but goes too far in describing it as a fact. It’s a matter of settled science that the Earth is much older, with the current consensus being that it is about 4.5 billion years of age. We rate the statement False.

Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., was appointed head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation appeared to be another instance of a fake headline placed atop an old story only advocating for the move. "Just in today: Trey Gowdy is the new director of the FBI!" read the headline on a June 23, 2017, post on Snoopack.com. Facebook users flagged the post as possibly being fake, as part of the social media site’s efforts to fight fake news. The post touts that Gowdy, the new head of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, had been noted as a potential replacement for ousted FBI Director James Comey. But it didn’t mention anything about that being a done deal, as the headline said. Indeed, there was talk in May that Gowdy was a potential candidate to replace Comey, but Gowdy took himself out of the running on May 15. He tweeted that he "would not be the right person" to take the job. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The Snoopack.com post is an uncredited copy of a March 29 post from AngryPatriotMovement.com, which initially carried the headline, "Petition: Appoint Trey Gowdy as director of the FBI." That original post went on for longer than the Snoopack.com version, and asked readers to share the post on Facebook to show support for Gowdy. TeaParty.org also copied the AngryPatriotMovement.com post, crediting the site and adding an online petition form. There’s no indication why the post about Gowdy, who has been the target of fake news before, was resurrected on June 23. Snoopack.com did not reply when we sent them an email via their online submission form. On June 7, President Donald Trump nominated Christopher Wray to head the FBI. Wray must be confirmed by the Senate. Fake news websites often put fake headlines on out-of-context news or opinion posts that aren’t bogus, leading to serious confusion for readers.

pomt-00158	"Intensifying Hurricane Willa headed directly toward 10,000 migrant caravan path."	false	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/oct/23/blog-posting/hurricane-headed-toward-migrant-caravan-not-so/	A headline on a site called Patriotic Express misleads by giving the impression that a hurricane is headed directly toward a caravan of immigrants bound for the United States. "Intensifying Hurricane Willa headed directly toward 10,000 migrant caravan path," said the Oct. 22 headline on patrioticexpress.com. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Hurricane Willa is projected to make landfall on Mexico’s Pacific coast on Tuesday, Oct.t 23. However, its projected landfall is more than 1,000 miles north of the caravan’s current location. The latest news reports say the caravan is in the town of Huixtla, in southern Mexico. Hurricane Willa’s watch and warning advisories do not extend to Huixtla. Patriotic Express cites weather.com (The Weather Channel) as reporting that the hurricane "should approach landfall along the southwestern coast of mainland Mexico by late Tuesday, which is expected to occur anywhere from near or north of Mazatlán to near Puerto Vallarta." (The Patriotic Express links to an outdated page on weather.com, but latest updates on weather.com maintain that landfall is expected in that general region, "south of Mazatlán and well north of Puerto Vallarta.") The caravan is far from that point. Parts of the Patriotic Express story are less misleading than the headline, saying that the hurricane "is set to cross the path that the migrants will eventually cross." "As the caravan heads north, there’s no doubt that they’ll eventually run into deteriorating conditions leftover from Willa — which we’ll soon see what level of damage it imposes upon populated areas of Mexico," the post said. "The strain on resources in many areas of Mexico is already bad — let alone the possibility of being hit by a major hurricane and a large army of hungry migrants." Though the caravan is heading north, it’s uncertain if it will cross the towns expected to be impacted by Hurricane Willa. Even then, the caravan — walking north — would be many days away from reaching that point if it went that direction. (If it chose to go to the Brownsville, Texas, border, it would be on the opposite side of the hurricane’s expected landfall.) The number of people in the caravan has increased since it started Oct. 13, reports peg the number traveling at around 7,000 — lower than 10,000 claimed in the Patriotic Express headline. A headline on patrioticexpress.com claimed, "Intensifying Hurricane Willa headed directly toward 10,000 migrant caravan path." The hurricane is expected to make landfall in Mexico — but nowhere near the caravan’s current location. It’s uncertain whether the caravan will pass through towns impacted by the hurricane.

pomt-07458	Says the fluoride Austin is putting in its drinking water is "toxic waste."	false	/texas/statements/2011/apr/19/mike-ford/austin-resident-says-flouride-compound-added-local/	In a letter to the editor published in the March 18 Austin Chronicle, Mike Ford suggests Austin residents have reason to question whether fluoridated water is safe. "How many would be comfortable if they knew that the fluoride Austin is putting into our drinking water is fluorosilicic acid (toxic waste from the fertilizer industry) that the city buys from Lucier Chemical Industries?" his letter states. Eww. Ford, an Austin resident, is part of Fluoride Free Austin, which has urged the city to stop putting fluoride in drinking water. On March 22, a City Council committee took testimony on the practice--and at least one speaker referred to the chemical additive as an industrial toxic waste, according to video of the hearing placed online. Ford answered our request for backup by forwarding information from various sources including a November 2009 memo from an assistant city manager to Austin’s City Council stating that after voter approval, the Austin Water Utility began adding fluoride to the water supply Feb. 2, 1973; the council can change the practice by majority vote. Nationally in 2008, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 195.5 million people (72.4 percent) on public water systems had access to "optimally fluoridated" water, up from 69 percent of individuals on public water supplies in 2006. The Environmental Protection Agency regulates how much fluoride that drinking water should have. The current recommended range is 0.7 to 1.2 milligrams (parts per million) per liter of water, though the EPA and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced plans in January to consider setting the limit at the low end of the current standard, 0.7 milligrams. Peter Silva, an EPA water administrator, said: "EPA’s new analysis will help us make sure that people benefit from tooth decay prevention while at the same time avoiding the unwanted health effects from too much fluoride." One health effect is dental fluorosis, which the agency’s announcement says "may occur with excess fluoride consumption during the tooth-forming years, age 8 and younger. Dental fluorosis in the United States appears mostly in the very mild or mild form – as barely visible lacy white markings or spots on the enamel. The severe form of dental fluorosis, with staining and pitting of the tooth surface, is rare in the United States." (It’s not rare in the Texas Panhandle, where groundwater is naturally high in fluoride.) The city of Austin memo says the "level of fluoride naturally occurring in the raw water supply for the City of Austin is 0.20 to 0.24 mg/l or parts per million. The Austin Water Utility adjusts the fluoride level to a range of 0.6 – 0.9 mg/l, averaging at about 0.75 mg/l. These values are well within the (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines for optimally fluoridated water as well as being within the recommended range from (the World Health Organization)." And what of the chemical compound cited in Ford’s letter? The memo says the fluoride product used is hydrofluorosilicic acid, which fulfills a standard ensuring "purity of products for the control of potential adverse human-health effects from products added directly to the water during treatment, storage and distribution." There’s no mention of fertilizer in the 17-page memo. Next, spokeswoman Jill Mayfield of the water utility sent us a statement stating that the acid, also known as FSA, is supplied by Mosaic Chemicals, which she said has bought Lucier Chemical. Mosaic generally describes itself as the world’s leading producer and marketer of concentrated phosphate and potash, two primary fertilizers. Mayfield said hydrofluorosilic acid is "derived from apatite which is a type of limestone deposit used in the production of fertilizers. The apatite is ground up and treated with sulfuric acid producing phosphoric acid (the main ingredient in the production of phosphate fertilizer) plus a solid and two gases. The two gases, hydrogen fluoride and silicon tetrafluoride, are captured in water to form hydrofluorosilicic acid." An entry on Mosaic’s site aligns with Mayfield’s explanation. It says the vapor stream from the phosphoric acid reaction is scrubbed with water to form FSA from the naturally occurring silica and fluorine in the phosphoric acid." We ran Ford’s description of the acid as "toxic waste" past the company. Spokesman Rob Litt replied by e-mail: "Many fluoridation opponents will cite the toxicity of the chemical in its concentrated form. This is a fallacy as no one is ingesting this concentrated form. By this rationale, these same individuals should also be opposed to Vitamin D, B6, A & E, which are all considered toxic in concentrated form." For more perspective, we contacted the CDC where Linda Orgain, a spokeswoman in its Division of Oral Health, said by e-mail that fluorosilicic acid "is not toxic waste." She pointed us to a CDC web page on water fluoridation with a section stating: "All additives used at water treatment plants, including fluoride additives, must meet strict quality standards that assure the public’s safety. These additives are subject to a stringent system of standards, testing, and certificates by the American Water Works Association (AWWA) and the National Sanitation Foundation/American National Standards Institute (NSF/ANSI). Both of these entities are nonprofit, nongovernmental organizations." Orgain added: "There are no health implications for community water fluoridation – at the level used for community water fluoridation (currently 0.7-1.2 mg/L) fluoridation prevents and controls tooth decay – preventing about 25 percent of decay in children and adults, throughout the lifespan." We filled Ford in on our research. He replied that the acid purchased by water providers cannot otherwise be dumped in the ocean, inland waterways or landfills unless it’s contained: "It’s toxic until they sell it to the city and then magically the city puts it in our water." Next, the CDC’s national water fluoridation engineer, Kip Duchon, said it’s ridiculous to call the water additive toxic waste. Duchon said the compound put in water comes from gypsum, a byproduct of phosphate-based fertilizer plants that often ends up piled in landfills. The compound results from a gas that’s isolated via vacuum extraction, he said, then quenched with water, making the acid. Per Ford’s point about pouring the acid into bodies of water, Duchon replied: "It’s no different than any other acid (undiluted) that would kill everything in the lake. It would be irresponsible of anyone to capriciously or arbitrarily dump . any chemical in a water body." Duchon said the acid becomes toxic at concentrations of more than 100 milligrams per liter, over 100 times the concentration in Austin’s water. He said he was aware of one episode involving such a toxic error involving a small community’s water well; an Alaska man died. Ford urged us to seek more on the compound’s toxicity from Neal Carman, also a participant in Fluoride Free Austin. Carman said a loophole in federal environmental law makes it possible to sell the compound so long as it’s going to be diluted. Then, he said, it’s no longer considered a hazardous waste. We were unable to confirm or disprove this claim; Mosaic’s description of the acid it ships to Austin says it’s corrosive but stable when stored properly. At the EPA, spokesman Richard Yost said by email that in "water at levels used for fluoridation, hexafluorosilicic acid hydrolyzes essentially completely to fluoride ions and various forms of silica... Various forms of silica and silicates occur in nature as sand and do not represent any health hazard." Yost said the fluoride compound put into Austin’s water is not on the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act list of "hazardous constituents" nor is it on the U.S. Department of Transportation’s hazardous materials transport list. Finally, we asked city officials to speak to Ford’s "toxic waste" reference. Philip Huang, medical director for the Austin/Travis County Health and Human Services Department, said it’s misleading and inflammatory to call the acid, which he calls a byproduct, toxic waste. Staff toxicologist Janet Pichette said the key issue for any substance is concentration. Even too much water "could kill you," she said. Last gulp: Ford’s statement accurately notes that the water utility buys the acid that fluoridates Austin’s drinking water from a fertilizer maker. Yet there’s no reasonable support for calling the the same acid toxic waste; it’s not poisonous at its concentration in the water. We rate the statement False.

pomt-10219	"The average American family" saw income rise $7,500 under Bill Clinton and decline $2,000 under George Bush.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/08/barack-obama/trend-is-right-but-numbers-are-wrong/	Update: The Obama campaign provided new information after we first published this item. We've included the additional material, but it doesn't change our ruling. In making his case for the presidency at the Democratic National Convention, Barack Obama cited statistics to argue that Americans have lost economic ground during the Bush administration. "We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage, whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma," Obama said in Denver on Aug. 28, 2008. "We measure progress in the 23-million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was president, when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush." We looked up the income numbers to see what happened to incomes during the Clinton years. We found Obama is correct that incomes went up under Clinton but dropped under Bush. But the numbers he uses aren't right. We looked to the U.S. Census report Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2007. Numbers in the report are adjusted for inflation and reflect 2007 dollar values. The report indicates that median household income during the Bush administration dropped from $50,557 in 2000 to $50,233 in 2007, a decline of $324. Under Bill Clinton, median household income rose from $44,359 in 1992 to $50,557 in 2000, an increase of $6,198. The Obama campaign uses different numbers to calculate income. They look at households in which the age of the householder is under age 65. The campaign believes this more accurately reflects earnings power for workers, because seniors have Social Security income that automatically rises with inflation. During the course of our research, we found a commentary written by one of Obama's economic advisers that cited the numbers Obama used, with the caveat that it applied to "working-age households." That would leave out seniors, and could conceivably change the numbers we found in the census. (The article didn't include a citation.) Obama didn't use the "working-age" caveat in his speech. Using those numbers, inflation-adjusted income goes from $51,039 in 1992 to $58,555 in 2000 to $56,545 in 2007. That comes to a drop of $2,010 during the Bush administration and an increase of $7,516 during the Clinton administration. (Note if you want to do your own calculations at home: Pull them from Census reports from the respective years, then use the more technical CPI-U-RS inflation calculator found here .) Having said all that, Obama didn't mention working-age families as part of his speech. Obama is right with the overall point he's making. Incomes did rise under Clinton and decline under Bush. But the numbers he uses don't include seniors, who today represent about 12 percent of the population. So we rate his statement only Half True.

pomt-04165	"I have the experience as Senate Budget Chair of cutting $4.5 billion in spending -- to close the deficit while protecting education and health care."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/dec/20/barbara-buono/barbara-buono-claims-she-cut-45b-spending-while-ch/	Cutting government spending – it’s a refrain many New Jerseyans say they want to hear from their elected officials. Cue Sen. Barbara Buono (D-Middlesex), who announced Dec. 11 that she would run for governor next year and is very familiar with wielding a budget ax. "I have the experience as Senate Budget Chair of cutting $4.5 billion in spending -- to close the deficit while protecting education and health care," Buono said in her gubernatorial announcement ad on YouTube. Spending did decrease while Buono chaired the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee, but it was not a singular effort.. Let’s look at how budgets work and then explain the $4.5 billion cut. New Jersey operates on a fiscal year beginning July 1 and ending the following June 30. The governor presents a budget, the Senate Budget and Appropriations and the Assembly Budget committees review it, and public hearings are held. The committees present the budget in what’s called an annual appropriations bill, which must be approved by the Legislature and the governor. The governor must sign the budget by July 1. Now, the cuts. David Rosen, chief budget officer for the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services, confirmed in an e-mail to Buono that appropriations from fiscal year 2008 to fiscal year 2010 dropped by $4.481 billion. The cuts were made after revenues plummeted by more than $3.5 billion from fiscal year 2008 to 2009, and fell another $1 billion from fiscal year 2009 to fiscal year 2010, according to Richard Keevey, who was budget director for former Gov. Jim Florio. Keevey, who teaches public budgeting systems and federal finance at Rutgers Newark, also served as a deputy budget director and budget director for former Gov. Tom Kean. "Thus, by necessity, appropriations needed to be reduced by the Governor and the Legislature to achieve a balanced budget as required by the constitution," Keevey said in an e-mail. So the cuts were made by a combination of people, including former Gov. Jon Corzine. Christina Zuk, Buono’s chief of staff, said in an e-mail that the senator wasn’t claiming sole responsibility for the cuts. "In the budget process both bodies of government vote on the final budgets, but the Senator's role as budget chair allowed her to oversee the budget process for those two years and begin to restore some sense of fiscal sanity to the process." Buono’s chairmanship was an important part of the process, noted Raphael Caprio, a professor of Public Administration in the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. "The inference is that she has the responsibility because she helped design the cuts," he said. "The fact of the matter is she was an important part of the process but the template was put on the table by the governor. I would basically say there is a core of truth to what she’s saying." Buono also claimed she protected education and health care while cutting the budget. But it was actually $2 billion in federal stimulus money Corzine included in his fiscal year 2010 budget that protected both. Keevey noted that $1.1 billion of the stimulus went to school aid appropriations. Without it, school aid would have dropped $900 million. Our ruling Buono claimed, "I have the experience as Senate Budget Chair of cutting $4.5 billion in spending -- to close the deficit while protecting education and health care." The nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services confirms a $4.481 billion decrease in spending from fiscal year 2008 to fiscal year 2010. The recession had much to do with the cuts, with revenues plummeting from fiscal year 2008 through fiscal year 2010 and spending adjusted accordingly. Also, the federal government, not Buono, protected education and health care with $2 billion in stimulus money. While it’s true that Buono’s chairmanship gave her experience in budget cutting, she alone isn’t responsible for cutting $4.5 billion. It was a team effort. And the last word on cuts, funding and balanced budgets belongs to the governor. For those reasons, we rate her statement Half True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.

pomt-02700	"More Americans believe the moon landing was fake than believe Obamacare is affordable."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2014/jan/03/tom-graves/graves-compares-obamacare-affordability-belief-fak/	The skepticism of some Americans knows no bounds. It extends, apparently, a quarter-million miles from Earth. A Georgia congressman and his staff recently saw a poll on the percentage of Americans who believe the historic 1969 moon landing was a fraud and compared it with another recent survey on the federal health care law known as Obamacare. "More Americans believe the moon landing was fake than believe Obamacare is affordable," U.S. Rep. Tom Graves’ Twitter account said in a Dec. 19 posting. It reminded some of us on the PolitiFact Georgia team of some lyrics from the Chumbawamba tune "Everything You Know Is Wrong." I was there when they landed on the moon. In a studio in Kentucky in June. Maybe that band is on to something. Graves, a tea party favorite who represents the conservative-leaning northwest corner of the state, has been a vocal foe of the health care law. The Twitter posting was included in a photo of astronauts (allegedly?) trekking across the moon. Graves encouraged his Twitter followers to retweet his message, stating "the fact that #Obamacare hurts families is no conspiracy theory!" The conservative National Review published an article with the headline "More People Believe Moon Landing Was a Hoax Than That Obamacare Will Lower Healthcare Costs." PolitiFact Georgia wanted to find out whether the House member was engaging in a conspiracy theory of his own by suggesting that a larger percentage of Americans believe the moon landing was staged than those who think Obamacare is affordable. Graves campaign spokesman Tim Baker quickly sent us two polls to support the congressman’s point. The first poll is by Public Policy Polling, a Raleigh, N.C.-based operation. It was conducted in March, asking nearly 1,250 Americans their opinions about various conspiracy theories through automated telephone interviews. The margin of error was 2.8 percent. The results were released the day after April Fools Day. The pollsters asked questions such as whether global warming is a hoax, whether Osama bin Laden is still alive, did the federal government allow the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks to occur and whether Paul McCartney was killed in a car wreck in 1966 and secretly replaced to keep the Beatles together? On to the question that piqued our interest. "Do you believe the moon landing was faked, or not?" Seven percent of respondents answered they believed it was faked; 84 percent did not believe it was faked, while 9 percent were not sure. The respondents were registered voters, and some of their answers to various questions went along party lines. For example, three-fifths of Republicans believe global warming is a hoax while three-quarters of Democrats do not believe it is a hoax. On the moon landing question, independents and Democrats were more slightly inclined than Republicans to believe it was a hoax. Just 5 percent of the respondents, and this was uniform across party lines, believe the Paul McCartney conspiracy theory. Now that we’ve determined it was Sir Paul who sang on "The Long and Winding Road," what about the health care poll? The Washington Post and ABC News joined forces in December to find out what Americans believe would be the impact of the health care law on their wallets. They specifically asked: "Do you think your health care costs (are increasing) as a result of these changes to the health care system, (are decreasing), or are remaining about the same?" Five percent said they expected their costs to decrease. Forty-seven percent said the costs would increase. Forty-four percent believe their costs will remain about the same. The remaining 4 percent had no opinion. About 1,000 people answered the question in a telephone poll, which was done between Dec. 12 and 15. The margin of error was 3.5 percent. So where does that leave us? Graves said this: "More Americans believe the moon landing was fake than believe Obamacare is affordable." One problem for Graves is the ABC News/Washington Post poll doesn’t actually use the word "affordable." There is a difference between saying you believe something will increase or decrease as opposed to whether a buyer considers something affordable. If you look solely at the percentage of respondents who say their health care costs will decrease and those in the PPP poll who say they believe the moon landing was faked, the congressman’s claim doesn’t seem out of this world. The numbers are close, though, and within the margin of error. The poll also clearly shows a lot of people think Obamacare will make health insurance more expensive, and a relatively few think that costs will come down. Graves has a point here. But it needs a lot of context to be properly understood. We rate his statement Half True.	None	Tom Graves	None	None	None	2014-01-03T06:00:00	2013-12-19	['United_States']
pomt-01710	"We have less crime in the (Rio Grande) Valley than we do in other major Texas cities."	half-true	/texas/statements/2014/aug/08/juan-chuy-hinojosa/does-rio-grande-valley-have-less-crime-major-texas/	A South Texas state senator objected to Gov. Rick Perry’s plans to send up to 1,000 National Guard troops to the Texas-Mexico border by suggesting crime in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley isn’t as bad as in other parts of the state. In a July 21, 2014, press release, Juan "Chuy" Hinojosa, D-McAllen, said the "humanitarian crisis" reflected in Central Americans crossing the Rio Grande "needs to be resolved through immigration reform and working with Mexico and Central American countries to stop the flow of immigrants coming across our border. To call up the National Guard is a very simplistic approach to a complex problem." Besides, Hinojosa said, "we have less crime in the Valley than we do in other major Texas cities. If we were to use crime as a basis to deploy the National Guard then we should be sending the National Guard to other metropolitan areas in our state." Has there been less crime in the region closest to the state’s southern tip than its big cities hundreds of miles away? We’ve explored crime near the border before. In March 2010, we rated as Pants on Fire Perry’s claim that his border-security efforts led to a 60 percent decrease in border crime. His cited calculations didn’t consider crimes committed in cities and towns where most border residents live. It also compared two calendar quarters rather than weighing years of data. Later, we saw flaws in descriptions of El Paso as the nation’s safest city, partly because the FBI has counseled against using its crime research to reach comparative judgments. In this instance, we were curious about Hinojosa’s twist on the crime comparison. Asked how Hinojosa reached his conclusion, Luis Moreno, his Senate chief of staff, forwarded a July 24, 2014, email from the Texas Department of Public Safety including a chart tallying arrests in 2013 and "to date" in 2014 in counties including Hidalgo in the Rio Grande Valley. In 2013 and in 2014, the chart shows, Harris, Dallas, Tarrant and Bexar counties each had more arrests than Hidalgo County. Nueces County, home to Corpus Christi, had the fewest arrests among the checked counties. Moreno said he did not ask DPS to convert the arrest counts to arrest rates. FBI crime figures As we launched our run at comparisons, we recognized with the help of Texas criminologists that the latest available data, as compiled by the FBI, enable comparisons only through the first half of 2013. That omits the 12 months through June 2014 — the period during which officials including Perry raised stepped-up concerns about border security in the wake of more unaccompanied children crossing the Rio Grande. That caveat in mind, we looked at different reported crimes by county and city, finding the senator’s statement held up for many -- but not all -- comparisons. We drew our figures from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting program, which tracks seven "index" crimes: murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny and auto theft. A hedge: State officials have said these counts underreport the amount of drug-cartel-related violence by not folding in common cartel-tied offenses such as extortion and kidnapping, as the Austin American-Statesman noted in an October 2011 news story on crime in the border region. Strap in; our comparisons follow. Total reported offenses, January through June 2013 An FBI chart presents counts of reported offenses in the first half of 2013 for more than 20 Texas cities, rolling in several of the biggest cities (Houston, Dallas, San Antonio and Austin but not Fort Worth) and smaller cities including Brownsville and McAllen, key cities in the Rio Grande Valley, which consists of Cameron, Hidalgo, Starr and Willacy counties. In the first half of 2013, each of the big cities had more total reported incidents of violent and property crime than the two valley cities. But that’s arguably not surprising given that Houston, Dallas and the other non-valley cities are much more populous than their valley counterparts. Adjusting for population differences To account for population differences, we focused on estimated rates of violent and property crimes per 100,000 residents. By this balancing metric, each of the sampled big cities had a higher rate of violent crime than Brownsville or McAllen in the first half of 2013. McAllen also had the lowest rate of property crime in this sampling. But the reported property-crime rate for Brownsville (2,156 per 100,000 residents) narrowly outpaced the rate for Dallas (2,137 per 100,000 residents). Crime rates, 2012 Seeking a full year’s comparison, we turned to population-adjusted rates for specific reported crimes in 2012 as broken out in an undated annual report by the DPS. Generally, the report showed, Houston, Dallas, San Antonio and Austin had more crimes per 100,000 residents than the valley cities of Brownsville and McAllen or the valley counties of Cameron, Hidalgo and Starr. But there were indications of places in the valley experiencing more crime. Rural Willacy County, population 8,355, bested all our sampled cities and counties with 108 rapes per 100,000 residents, based on its 2012 total of nine reported rapes. Based on 37 total reported assaults, the county also trailed only Houston in our sampling in its rate of aggravated assaults, and it landed third for its rate of reported burglaries. Also, Brownsville, Harlingen and McAllen had higher rates of reported larceny than Houston or Dallas, according to the report. Another twist: Harlingen’s general rate of 5,279 reported crimes per 100,000 residents (based on 3,543 total reported offenses) exceeded Dallas’ rate of 5,049 reported crimes per 100,000 residents (based on 62,680 reported offenses).

In this snapshot, Harris County had the No. 1 violent crime rate, but the valley’s Starr County landed second and Hidalgo County was third. Willacy County didn’t show up in this data set. Harris County also ranked first in its rate of reported property crimes in our sampling. However, the valley counties--Hidalgo, Starr and Cameron--ranked second, third and fourth ahead of Bexar, Travis and Tarrant counties.

We don’t know how crime compares in this way for the months since June 2013. But for 2012 and the first half of 2013, reported crime rates, adjusted for population differences, mostly showed the big cities outside the valley experiencing more crime.

pomt-08196	"Demand for transportation choice is on the rise, with 14 percent more Ohioans riding passenger trains over the past year."	true	/ohio/statements/2010/nov/24/ohio-department-transportation/odot-cites-heightened-amtrak-ridership-light-poten/	Republican Gov.-elect John Kasich has made it clear he will cancel Ohio’s $400 million passenger train project when he takes office in January. Gov. Ted Strickland, who lost to Kasich earlier this month and strongly supported the project, denied Kasich’s recent request to halt spending on environmental and engineering studies related to it that already has topped $1 million. Advocates for the project, which would use federal stimulus money to establish a Cleveland to Columbus to Cincinnati train line, remain hopeful Kasich will change his mind. While Kasich views the 3C rail corridor as a waste of money, supporters say it will create jobs and meet a growing demand for passenger train service. The Ohio Department of Transportation issued a news release on Oct. 25 touting the increasing desire among Ohioans to travel by train. The department said "demand for transportation choice is on the rise, with 14 percent more Ohioans riding passenger trains over the past year." ODOT, under the leadership of Strickland appointee Jolene Molitoris, is overseeing the $400 million rail project. Department spokesman Scott Varner said the increasing demand for passenger rail "adds to the viability of the 3C. It shows there is a ridership demand." Even though Kasich seems determined to kill the train project, we decided to look into Ohioans’ supposedly increasing appetite for train travel. If accurate, it would be a worthy factoid for rail advocates to put before Kasich. Amtrak is the only passenger rail operator in the state, according to the Ohio Rail Development Commission, so passengers on its trains would fully account for ridership in Ohio. To measure ridership, Amtrak counted the number of passengers who boarded a train or got off a train at one of Ohio’s seven Amtrak train stations. The counting method exposes Amtrak to some level of duplication. If a passenger is traveling within the state – from Cleveland to Sandusky, for example -- he would be counted twice: once when he boards the train in Cleveland and again when he gets off in Sandusky. Spokesman Marc Magliari said Amtrak would not release statistics of intercity travel in Ohio because the information is considered proprietary. But he said such travel is rare. "Most people aren’t going from Elyria to Bryan," Magliari said. According to Amtrak, there were 128,174 passengers whose train ride began or ended at an Ohio train station in the 2009 fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 30. There were 146,861 such passengers in the 2010 fiscal year. That’s a 14.6 percent increase. The Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Transportation regularly audits Amtrak’s operations. Three such audits have been initiated so far this year. However, the Inspector General’s office could not say whether or not Amtrak’s ridership figures are accurate. "We do not have any information that would lend to us having a response," David Wonnenberg, of the Inspector General’s office, said in an e-mail. "We have not issued an audit report in which these or similar questions came up." Amtrak confirmed the figures on which ODOT relied to boast about Ohio’s spike in passenger rail ridership. The railroad’s method of counting passengers does leave some room for inflation. But since the same counting method was used in 2009 and 2010, such increases would occur in both years so the impact on the data would be consistent. We rate the statement True.

pomt-07012	Forty percent of union members voted Republican in 2008.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/07/bill-kristol/bill-kristol-says-40-percent-republicans-voted-joh/	On the July 3, 2011, edition of Fox News Sunday, panelists discussed the connections between labor unions and the Democratic Party. During the exchange, Bill Kristol, the editor of the conservative magazine The Weekly Standard, said that despite longstanding ties between unions and Democrats, support for Republicans among voters who are union members is higher than one might think. The discussion began with a clip of Vice President Joe Biden appearing before a union audience in Las Vegas, joking about the bond between unions and Democrats. A moment later, Kristol said, "Joe Biden spoke more truth than he realized when he made this joke that, well, you guys, it's out of the question that you union members could vote Republican. A lot of union members vote Republican. I think a third -- what is it, 40 percent, even of union members voted Republican even in 2008? "And, in fact," he continued, " ... it's a real question how much the union leadership speaks for the members. And I do think it's very important for the Republican candidate in 2012 to be able to win over what we used to call Reagan Democrats, many of whom are (or) who have been union members." To check Kristol, we decided to look at exit poll data -- the surveys taken every two years of voters leaving polling places. These surveys, which are designed to capture a snapshot of the electorate on Election Day, classify voters by a range of demographic questions, some of which involve union membership. We looked at the exit poll numbers for 2008 and found that 39 percent of voters from union households voted for Republican presidential nominee John McCain, compared to 59 percent for Democrat Barack Obama. So Kristol’s memory was essentially correct. Still, we’ll provide a couple minor caveats. First, there are slight differences between how voters from union households voted (that is, the numbers we cited above) and how union members themselves voted (which is specifically how Kristol phrased his comment). Union members voted 60 percent for Obama and 37 percent for McCain -- two points less for McCain than voters who lived in union households. (Voters from union households accounted for 21 percent of the electorate in 2008, while union members accounted for 12 percent.) Second, judging by the context, we think Kristol meant voting patterns in the 2008 presidential race, but it’s worth noting that the same exit polls painted a different picture of union voter behavior in House elections. In 2008, voters from union households split their vote for House candidates this way: 34 percent for Republican candidates and 64 percent for Democratic candidates. The numbers were similar for actual union members -- 34 percent backed Republican candidates and 65 percent backed Democratic candidates. We also wondered about the long-term trendline, since Kristol’s implication was that Republicans did pretty well in 2008 in securing union votes. So we looked at past levels of union support for GOP candidates. For presidential elections, we compared the GOP candidate’s vote share from union members to the GOP candidate’s vote share from all voters. (In every case, the Republican did better among all voters than among union voters.) We found that McCain did better than almost all of his Republican predecessors in winning votes from union households. McCain won 46 percent of the vote nationally, so his union backing was only 7 points behind his overall support. Since 1952, only one other Republican candidate did as well among union voters -- Ronald Reagan in 1980, who also had a gap of just 7 points between overall support and union support. But Reagan wasn’t able to repeat his magic in 1984 -- his union vote trailed his national vote by 13 points. And that pattern continued until McCain in 2008, with the gap bouncing between 11 and 13 points from 1984 to 2004. So there’s some support for the notion that Republicans are doing pretty well among union voters these days. Kristol’s recollection on Fox News Sunday was very close to reality. We’re only lowering him a notch due to a lack of clarity about whether he meant union members as opposed to union households, and about which 2008 election he meant -- presidential or House. On balance, we rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Bill Kristol	None	None	None	2011-07-07T10:16:16	2011-07-03	['Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-06570	Because of Jim Whelan, "the 1990s are the only decade since the 1920s when the population of Atlantic City actually went up."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/sep/30/jim-whelan/former-atlantic-city-mayor-jim-whelan-says-his-rec/	Following the years when political boss Nucky Johnson ruled the Prohibition-era boardwalk, Atlantic City saw its population drop decade after decade through the greater part of the 20th Century. That is, until Jim Whelan came along. Seeking re-election to his State Senate seat, Whelan, a Democrat, has pointed to Atlantic City’s population growth during the 1990s as one of his achievements as city mayor. Whelan served as mayor from 1990 to 2001. In a Sept. 15 debate against his Republican opponent, Assemblyman Vince Polistina, Whelan said the following about his record: "John Adams told us years ago facts are stubborn things. Here are some facts. The 1990s are the only decade since the 1920s when the population of Atlantic City actually went up." PolitiFact New Jersey found that Whelan’s statistics on population growth are accurate, but he may be taking too much credit. The increase in Atlantic City’s population was part of a larger trend involving other American cities, and coincided with the growth of the city’s casino industry. First, let’s explain the population figures. Starting in 1860, the population of Atlantic City rose for seven consecutive decades, from 687 residents in 1860 to 66,198 in 1930, according to U.S. census data. But then, the numbers started to fall. Between 1930 and 1990, the city’s population declined every decade for a total loss of nearly 43 percent, according to census data. In Whelan’s first year as mayor, the city’s population was 37,986. Ten years later, Atlantic City’s population had increased by about 6.7 percent to 40,517 residents. However, by 2010, the city’s population had fallen slightly to 39,558. So, Whelan is correct that his tenure included the only decade of population growth since the 1920s -- but how much did he have to do with that? Whelan acknowledged he is not solely responsible for the population growth, but said his administration put an emphasis on basic services and providing "safe, clean streets." Whelan noted that his administration hired more police and demolished blighted buildings. Gwendolyn Harris, executive director of the Senator Walter Rand Institute for Public Affairs at Rutgers University, said a mayor and city government can receive credit for population growth. City officials are involved in making quality-of-life improvements and facilitating development, she said. But a significant factor in the city’s population growth was the growth of the casino industry, which was put in motion more than a decade before Whelan became mayor. In his first year in office, Atlantic City was home to 12 casinos. Keith Mills, director of Atlantic City’s Department of Planning and Development, who has worked in the department since 1988, attributed the population growth, in large part, to the demand for casino workers. In fact, the number of casino employees increased during Whelan’s tenure and peaked in 1997 at 49,123 workers. Another contributing factor was the development of new housing stock through the reinvestment of casino dollars, as required by state law -- a process that involved both city officials and the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority, Mills said. As for Whelan’s role, Mills said a mayor still needs the cooperation of the city council, just as President Barack Obama needs Congress to support his initiatives. "It takes a lot to move anything along. … It’s no different here in Atlantic City," Mills said. Population studies experts also pointed out that Atlantic City’s growth in the 1990s was part of a national trend of urban population increases in certain cities, a movement partly driven by the influx of immigrants. "This is not a unique experience," said Janice Madden, a professor in the Population Studies Center at the University of Pennsylvania. Census data show that Atlantic City’s immigrant population sharply increased during Whelan’s mayoralty. By 2000, the number of foreign-born residents had increased by 166 percent since 1990, and represented nearly a quarter of the city’s population. But, Madden said, city governments still need to have policies that attract new people and keep existing residents in town. Our ruling Whelan’s statistics about Atlantic City’s population changes are on target, but the population growth came from a variety of factors. As the city’s political leader, Whelan obviously played a role in new development and other improvements, but he also inherited a booming casino industry and served at a time when more immigrants were moving to urban areas across the country.

pomt-14638	Under Ted Cruz’s tax plan, "businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make. They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2016/jan/26/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-ted-cruz-flat-tax-charges-16-perc/	Ted Cruz’s tax plan, envisioning tax returns that fit on postcards, would whack businesses twice over, Marco Rubio says. We wondered about that. In the Jan. 14, 2016, Fox Business Network Republican presidential debate in North Charleston, S.C., Sen. Rubio of Florida said that under the plan advocated by Sen. Cruz of Texas, businesses basically "will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees." A moment later, Rubio said Cruz’s plan "does not eliminate the corporate (income) tax or the payroll tax. Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make. They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees." Cruz disputed that characterization, saying in part that "a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax. It goes away." Cruz’s plan replaces the corporate income tax, the payroll tax and others with a flat tax. Does it also make businesses pay 16 percent on profits and payroll, as Rubio said? Cruz’s plan outlined After emailing Rubio’s campaign about how he reached his 16 percent conclusions, we turned to Cruz’s tax plan as outlined by his campaign. "Under the Simple Flat Tax," Cruz says on a campaign webpage, "the current seven rates of personal income tax will collapse into a single low rate of 10 percent. For a family of four, the first $36,000 will be tax-free. The Child Tax Credit will remain in place," Cruz proposes, and the plan revamps the earned-income tax credit while preserving deductions for charitable contributions and mortgage interest payments. Here’s the flat-tax postcard as envisioned by Cruz: SOURCE: Web page, "The Simple Tax Plan," Ted Cruz presidential campaign (viewed Jan. 20, 2016) Next up: the 16 percent element. On Cruz’s website, we spotted no direct indication the 16 percent would apply to payroll spending. "For businesses," Cruz says there, "the corporate income tax will be eliminated. It will be replaced by a simple Business Flat Tax at a single 16 percent rate. The current payroll tax system will be abolished, while maintaining full funding for Social Security and Medicare." Cruz further says the business flat tax "will be based on revenues minus expenses such as equipment, computers, and other business investments." In general, Cruz says, his proposed tax overhaul will deliver a tremendous economic boost, according to the "well-respected Tax Foundation," a Washington, D.C., nonprofit that describes itself as a leading independent tax policy research organization. Independent breakdowns We fetched the foundation’s October 2015 analysis of Cruz’s plan which, the foundation said, would "replace the corporate income tax and all payroll taxes with a 16 percent ‘Business Transfer Tax,’ or subtraction method value-added tax. In addition, his plan would repeal a number of complex features of the current tax code." Farther along, the analysis spelled out a payroll aspect. Specifically, the foundation said, Cruz’s plan: "Enacts a broad-based, 16 percent ‘Business Transfer Tax’ or value-added tax. This tax is levied on all business profits, less capital investment. This would include the payroll of business, government, and nonprofit institutions, as well as net imports. The tax would exempt from taxation the purchase of health insurance. A business transfer tax is also often known as a subtraction-method value-added tax. While its base is identical in economic terms to that of the credit-invoice VAT seen in many OECD countries, it is calculated from corporate accounts, not on individual transactions. The foundation also said: "Under current law, some taxes on labor are explicitly levied on nominal wages, reducing take-home pay, while others are implicitly passed on to workers through lower nominal wages. The business transfer tax would also fall substantially on payrolls, but it would do so entirely through implicit reductions in nominal wages rather than explicit reductions in take-home pay." That’s a bit gobbledy-gooky for us. A foundation official, Kyle Pomerleau, told us by phone and email that what Rubio said largely holds up, though it would be wrong to conclude businesses under Cruz’s plan would pay 16 percent on the same money twice. That is, Pomerleau elaborated, Cruz’s plan eliminates the existing payroll tax, which is 15.3 percent of wages (half of that paid by employers, the other half by employees), but the plan counts payroll expenditures as part of net business profits, which are taxed at 16 percent. "Even though his plan gets rid of the payroll tax," Pomerleau emailed, "his new Business Flat Tax will end up taxing that payroll by disallowing its deduction at the business level." Another authority, Joe Rosenberg of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, told us by phone that Rubio was accurate about Cruz’s plan presuming he meant what most people define as "profit" by his phrase "what you make." Rosenberg walked us through how he sees Cruz’s plan working: Say a business buys something for 50 cents at wholesale and has to pay its employees 50 cents, accumulating $1 in costs. Then the business sells the something for $1.10, drawing a 10-cent profit. Under the Cruz plan, Rosenberg said, the business pays the flat tax solely on the 60-cent difference between the $1.10 in sales and the 50 cents spent on the wholesale purchase. And, Rosenberg noted, there’s another way to pin what Cruz’s plan subjects to the 16 percent tax -- by isolating what the business "makes," the 10 cents, and then adding the 50 cents in employee payroll. "It’s very fair to interpret what Sen. Rubio said as correct," Rosenberg said, though it’s also worth mention (again) that Cruz’s plan eliminates existing payroll and income taxes. Broadly, Rosenberg didn’t agree that Cruz’s plan whipsaws businesses, saying: "It’s a change in the way they’re taxed. It’s not taxing something twice." We didn’t hear back from Rubio’s camp about his claim nor did Cruz aides engage. Footnote: A Jan. 14, 2016, foundation post by economist Alan Cole says Cruz and Rubio aren’t proposing entirely distinct tax approaches. "In fact," Cole wrote, "if you put together two taxes from Rubio’s plan (and fiddle with the rates), you can actually synthetically construct the business flat tax from Cruz’s plan!" Our ruling Rubio said that under Cruz’s tax plan, "businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make. They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees." Under Cruz’s plan, that rate applies both to net income and payroll expenditures though the way this description was phrased by Rubio merits clarification. That is, the 16 percent would not be applied to what a business makes and separately applied again to money paid to employees. Also unsaid: The proposed tax would replace taxes including payroll and income taxes. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-06749	Says enrolling a student in a subsidized lunch program triggers an "at risk" designation, resulting in an extra $6,000 to $7,000 of state school aid per student.	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/aug/25/michael-doherty/state-sen-mike-doherty-says-school-districts-recei/	Taxpayers are picking up the tab for more than just lunch in Elizabeth schools, according to state Sen. Michael Doherty. A story in The Sunday Star-Ledger revealed three officials from the Union County school district allegedly enrolled their children in a subsidized lunch program, even though they earn too much to qualify for it. Doherty (R-Warren), one of several New Jersey officials who called for an investigation into the matter, wrote a letter to acting state Education Commissioner Christopher Cerf saying he’s worried the program opens another avenue for abuse. "This year, when you appeared before the Senate Budget Committee, I informed you about the potential for abuse of the free and reduced price lunch program, and how enrolling a student in the program triggers an "At Risk" designation, which results in an additional $6,000-7,000 of state school aid for a student," Doherty wrote to Cerf in an Aug. 22 letter. "This additional school aid, which can exceed hundreds of millions of dollars, is collected from taxpayers throughout the state." PolitiFact New Jersey found Doherty is mostly right: when a student is enrolled in the federally supported lunch program, they are designated as at risk. But his claim that each at-risk student brings in up to $7,000 in additional state aid needs clarification. We’ll first explain how an at-risk designation translates into increased per-pupil spending. The "School Funding Reform Act of 2008" set up the formula that calculates how state education spending is determined for New Jersey school districts. The formula sets a minimum amount that the state believes must be spent on a student to provide a "thorough and efficient education." The base amount can increase depending on a variety of factors, including whether a student is considered at risk. At-risk students include those who qualify for a free or reduce-price lunch, according to state law. An at-risk student is weighted differently in the formula, increasing the amount of funds the state believes should be spent to educate that child. So, we’ve determined Doherty is correct about the at-risk designation. But what about his claim that for each at-risk student, a school district receives up to $7,000 more in state aid? The state auditor released a report in June, which said: "The Department of Education's state formula aid per the School Funding Reform Act of 2008 is increased to a school district by between $4,700 and $5,700 for each student eligible for the school lunch program." Stephen Eells, the state auditor, said his department calculated the aid figures based on the minimum per-pupil spending amount set by the state -- and then rounded the figures. So, a student in a school district where less than 20 percent of the population is considered at-risk receives about $4,700 more in aid. For districts, like Elizabeth, where more than 60 percent of the student population is considered at risk a student brings in nearly $5,700 in more aid, per Eells calculation. Other districts fall somewhere within that range, Eells said. Justin Barra, a spokesman for the state education department, said the education department doesn’t calculate specific costs for at-risk pupils because it is just one of many factors. But, he said in an email that the state "estimates that no district receives more than $6,000 per at-risk student, with a significant number much lower than that, and some receiving no funding at all." Doherty told us his figures were in reference to districts like Elizabeth, but he doesn’t make that clear in his letter. Still, his numbers aren’t far off from the state auditor’s figures for a district with a student population that includes more than 60 percent of at-risk students. Here's the difference. Doherty included money for security aid, which is increased from a base amount of $70 per student to up to more than $400 per at-risk student, according to the state funding formula. Doherty also included at-risk students who are bilingual, a designation that further increases per-pupil spending by his calculations to nearly $7,000. The ruling Doherty said school districts receive an additional $6,000 to $7,000 in state aid for every student enrolled in a free or reduced-price lunch program. Doherty was right that more education funding is allocated for students who receive a subsidized lunch. Though the amount of that funding varies by district, we think Doherty’s statement is on point. We rate his claim Mostly True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.	None	Michael Doherty	None	None	None	2011-08-25T05:00:00	2011-08-22	['None']
pomt-10349	Barack Obama wants to "unilaterally disarm our nation."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/15/chain-email/obama-wants-to-reduce-stockpiles-not-disarm/	Anonymous e-mails claim that Sen. Barack Obama wants to "unilaterally disarm our nation" — and they say they have the video to prove it. "You do not have to check Snopes to determine if this is true or false ... watch and listen to Obama's own words," warns one e-mail. "Look at this ASAP — it may be pulled from the Obama Web site very soon," another e-mail states. "This is shocking and reprehensible," opines a third e-mail. All the e-mails link to YouTube video that shows Barack Obama talking about his defense policies. The only problem is, Obama doesn't say in the video that he wants to disarm the United States. Rather, Obama talks about ending the war in Iraq, curtailing wasteful defense spending, and negotiating with Russia to reduce the U.S. nuclear arsenal. He says he wants "a world without nuclear weapons," but as we'll explain shortly, that statement is well within the mainstream of U.S. foreign policy thought. We went looking for the source of the video and found it fairly quickly on the Obama campaign Web site. The official version includes opening and concluding remarks in which he emphasizes he will eliminate wasteful spending and make his sole priority protecting the American people. Obama's campaign created the video while campaigning to win the Iowa caucuses. Obama was seeking the endorsement of Caucus4Priorities, an Iowa-based advocacy movement that wants a portion of defense spending diverted to domestic issues like education and jobs. The group instead endorsed John Edwards. Here's Obama's statement in its entirety. We've noted where the edited version in the chain e-mails begins and ends: "Thanks so much for the Caucus4Priorities, for the great work you've been doing. As president, I will end misguided defense policies and stand with Caucus4Priorities in fighting special interests in Washington. First, I'll stop spending $9-billion a month in Iraq. [Edited video starts.] I'm the only major candidate who opposed this war from the beginning, and as president, I will end it. "Second, I will cut tens of billions of dollars in wasteful spending. I will cut investments in unproven missile defense systems. I will not weaponize space. I will slow our development of future combat systems, and I will institute an independent defense priorities board to ensure that the quadrennial defense review is not used to justify unnecessary spending. "Third, I will set a goal of a world without nuclear weapons. To seek that goal, I will not develop new nuclear weapons. I will seek a global ban on the production of fissile material, and I will negotiate with Russia to take our ICBMs off hair-trigger alert and to achieve deep cuts in our nuclear arsenals. [Edited video ends.] "You know where I stand. I've fought for open, ethical and accountable government my entire public life. I don't switch positions or make promises that can't be kept. I don't posture on defense policy, and I don't take money from federal lobbyists for powerful defense contractors. As president, my sole priority for defense spending will be protecting the American people. Thanks so much." We suspect that the phrase "a world without nuclear weapons" may have set off Obama's anonymous critics. Actually, that goal has been promoted by foreign policy experts on both sides of the political aisle. Obama's goal echoes an opinion piece published in the Wall Street Journal on Jan. 4, 2007, authored by George P. Shultz, William J. Perry, Henry A. Kissinger and Sam Nunn. Its title: "A World Free of Nuclear Weapons." "The end of the Cold War made the doctrine of mutual Soviet-American deterrence obsolete," their essay said. "Deterrence continues to be a relevant consideration for many states with regard to threats from other states. But reliance on nuclear weapons for this purpose is becoming increasingly hazardous and decreasingly effective." The piece then goes on to argue for similar points as Obama mentions in his statement, though in more detail. The authors have significant foreign policy experience: Shultz was was secretary of state under Ronald Reagan; Perry was defense secretary under Bill Clinton; Kissinger was secretary of state under Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford; and Nunn was chairman of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee. The piece kicked off enough discussion and debate in the foreign policy community that the quartet authored another piece for the Wall Street Journal a year later, titled "Toward a Nuclear-Free World," in which they discussed growing support for their ideas. Not everyone agreed, of course. In May 2008, the Weekly Standard published a detailed critique of the policies by Gary J. Schmitt of the American Enterprise Institute and Henry Sokolski of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, who argued that their proposed solutions would be difficult to implement. For our fact-checking purposes, the point here is that Obama's statement falls firmly within the mainstream of the U.S. foreign policy debate. His position does not constitute unilateral disarmament, said John Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org, a Web site that specializes in information about defense, the military, weapons of mass destruction and homeland security. "He's advocating the abolition of nuclear weapons in general, not nuclear disarmament," Pike said. "If you're going to disagree with him, you have to understand what you're disagreeing with." The notion of unilateral disarmament is pretty much a nonstarter for both major political parties, including Obama, he added. "Outside of the religious pacifist community, that is just not a policy position that has had meaningful political support in the United States," Pike said. One of the outlets that has promoted the Obama-wants-to-disarm-us argument is the conservative blog Macsmind. Macsmind linked on Feb. 27, 2008, to a YouTube video; several of the e-mails we received linked to the Macsmind post. Macsmind posted the commentary, "Sen. McCain, you should grab this video and play it on every ad you can. This is absolutely shocking reprehensible. He plans to universally disarm our nation (sic). The question is for what, and more specifically 'for whom'." On June 8, Macsmind posted a full version of the video, noting "some lefties are complaining that the video is a hack job and it's out of context. Therefore I present to you context." Macsmind and others may not like the foreign policy goals that Obama outlines in his video, but it's deceptive to call those goals unilateral disarmament. For this reason, we find this the chain e-mail's statements to be False.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2008-07-15T00:00:00	2008-05-21	['None']
pomt-01286	The gender gap in his support is "not unique to me" and "there’s not a huge gap from where Republicans have been in presidential, gubernatorial and US Senate elections" in recent years.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/oct/31/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-gender-gap-his-support-similar-o/	In mid-October, Republican Gov. Scott Walker answered a journalist’s question about Democratic challenger Mary Burke’s superior poll numbers among women, minorities and young people. How did he account for that? "Some of those issues are just historic patterns, they’re not unique to me," Walker told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s editorial board Oct. 14, 2014. "If you look at Republican-Democrat (numbers) you could make -- in the last dozen or so elections -- similar parallels to that. So there’s not a huge gap from where Republicans have been in presidential, gubernatorial and U.S. Senate elections." He added: "For a lot of this it’s a matter of getting our message out, getting our story out. We’re not conceding any votes in the state of Wisconsin." With several gender-based issues at the heart of each side’s TV advertising, and experts saying the Nov. 4, 2014 election is likely to come down to turnout efforts on each side, we wanted to check the historical record on the so-called gender gap and Republican candidates. Are Walker’s 2014 poll numbers among women and men pretty similar to the gender gap seen in past Wisconsin elections for GOP candidates? For this pre-election analysis, we turned to the exit polls taken of voters as they leave the voting booth after each election. We examined comparable races in recent Wisconsin history, as well as polling data in the 2012 and 2014 campaigns in Wisconsin. Defining the gap The gender gap -- Republicans doing better with men than women; Democrats doing better with women than men -- is a feature of contemporary politics. Within each party, men and women don’t vote that differently. But the Democratic Party has fewer men among its supporters; the Republican Party has fewer women. One way to measure the gender gap is to simply take the difference between how a candidate does with men and how that candidate does with women. In the 2012 recall race, Walker got 59 percent of the male vote and 47 percent of the female vote -- a gender gap of 12 points. (His opponent Tom Barrett got 40 percent of the male vote and 52 percent of the female vote, also a 12-point difference). That 12-point gender gap was the largest in a Wisconsin U.S. Senate or governor’s race for which we were able to obtain exit poll data in recent decades. But it is not dramatically at odds with how Republican candidates have performed in Wisconsin in other major races in the past few years. Historical picture The gender gap has been growing in Wisconsin. In her 1988 U.S. Senate race against Democrat Herb Kohl, Republican Susan Engeleiter did three points worse with women than men. In his 1992 Senate race against Democrat Russ Feingold, GOP Sen. Bob Kasten did two points worse with women than men. But these gender gaps grew in the 1990s and 2000s -- ranging in the mid- to high-single digits. For example, former Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson did four points worse with women than men in 1994 and seven points worse in 1998. Republican Mark Neumann did four points worse with women in his 1998 race against Feingold. And Republican Mark Green did five points worse with women than men in his race against Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle in 2006. The gender gap got bigger still in the 2010 election. Walker did nine points worse among women than men in winning the governor’s race, as did Republican Ron Johnson in winning his U.S. Senate race against Feingold. In the 2012 U.S. Senate race against Tammy Baldwin, Republican Tommy Thompson did 10 points worse with women than women. Looking back over that landscape, it’s clear that Walker’s 12-point gender gap in the 2012 recall race is the biggest of all these races, but it’s consistent with the trend of a growing gender gap. And it’s not a great deal bigger than other big statewide races in 2010 and 2012. Presidential races When you broaden the focus to consider presidential voting in Wisconsin, the biggest difference is that the gender gap appeared earlier in time and hasn’t really grown that much. Some examples: George Herbert Walker Bush did 10 points worse with women than men in his 1988 race; George W. Bush did 11 points worse with women in 2000 and six points worse in 2004; John McCain did six points worse with women in 2008 and Mitt Romney did nine points worse with women than men in 2012. We have been describing these Republican candidates as doing "worse with women" but you could just as easily describe them as doing "better with men," since the gender gap is a double-edged sword for the two parties. For Republicans it can result from weakness among women, but it can also result from strength among men. For Democrats, it’s just the other way around. In his two victories for governor, Walker lost women voters, but not overwhelmingly, getting 48 percent of women in 2010 and 47 percent in 2012. The gender gap in those races was more about Walker’s strength with male voters, winning men with 57 percent in 2010 and 59 percent in 2012. 2014 governor’s race What does the gender gap look like in the 2014 race between Walker and Burke? For the answer, we can turn to the regular polling done by the Marquette University Law School. We also looked at the gender gaps in these other races in Marquette’s polling: the June 2012 recall race between Walker and Barrett; the 2012 Senate race between Baldwin and Thompson; and the 2012 presidential race between Romney and Barack Obama. We calculated the average gender gap in all the polling for each race. And once again, the Walker races featured the biggest gender gaps, though they were only marginally bigger than the other two races. The 2012 recall race had the biggest gender gap of the four contests. We should note that if the question is not the gap between men and women, but Walker's performance with women specifically, his numbers are actually better than the most Republicans in recent years in Wisconsin. That is, he has lost among women, but not by as much as many other candidates in his party in this state. The most notable exception is Thompson, whose landslide victories for governor featured big winning margins among both men and women. Thompson’s victories in the 1990s, in fact, are the only case we could find in recent decades of a Republican winning women in Wisconsin in a statewide contest for governor, U.S. Senate or president. One last note about the gender gap this year. In Marquette’s polling of the Walker-Burke race, the gender gap has fluctuated a lot from poll to poll, raising some eyebrows among political observers. It’s not unusual for swings to occur among subgroups of voters, and it’s sometimes due to random variation from survey to survey. The gender gap shrank dramatically in Marquette’s first October poll, but returned in Marquette’s last pre-election poll taken Oct. 23 to 26. If you average all the Marquette polls this year, you find that the gender gap is alive and well. Walker has been winning 52 percent of male registered voters and 42 percent of female registered voters over the course of nine 2014 polls. Burke has been winning 48 percent of female registered voters and 40 percent of male registered voters. Our rating Walker said the gender gap in his support is "not unique to me" and "there’s not a huge gap from where Republicans have been in presidential, gubernatorial and US Senate elections" in recent years. Walker is correct when he suggests the gender gap in his race is not dramatically different from that seen for other Republican candidates in other comparable races in Wisconsin in recent history. At the same time, according to exit polls, Walker’s 2012 recall win featured a bigger gender gap than any other recent race for governor or U.S. Senate in Wisconsin. We rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-05717	"Fifty percent of the graduating class of the year 2012 will have smoked marijuana or have done illegal drugs."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2012/mar/07/gary-johnson/marijuana-use-claim-close-mark/	Most Georgians missed it, but there was a presidential debate here after all. Actually, it was a forum, and the candidates weren’t the Republicans vying for the White House. (CNN canceled a debate set for last Thursday in Atlanta when GOP candidates Mitt Romney and Ron Paul said they had other plans.) These candidates were Libertarians, five of them, and they answered questions from a moderator for about an hour at their party’s Georgia state convention Feb. 25 in Athens. The Truth-O-Meter started swaying when Gary Johnson, who won a straw poll afterward with 79 percent of the vote, was asked a question about legalizing marijuana. Johnson, who believes in legalizing marijuana, said an individual’s drug problem should be handled by his or her family -- not the criminal justice system. He then offered this statistic: "Fifty percent of the [high school] graduating class of the year 2012 will have smoked marijuana or have done some illegal drugs," said Johnson, a former two-term governor of New Mexico. We wondered whether Johnson, who initially tried running as a Republican for president this year, was correct? For the record, Johnson doesn’t believe teenagers should have access to marijuana. Johnson does believe marijuana is less harmful than alcohol and thinks the money the federal government spends on marijuana enforcement could be better spent "against the individuals committing real crimes against society." The Atlanta-based U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention keeps data on marijuana use. According to the CDC’s most recent data, from 2009, nearly 46 percent of 12th-graders had smoked marijuana at least once. Nearly 51 percent of 12th-grade boys had used marijuana, while the percentage of girls was lower, at just over 40 percent. In Georgia, the percentage of all 12th-graders who tried marijuana at least once was nearly identical to the national average. The CDC figures showed the following for other illicit drug use by 12th-graders in 2009: Nearly 8 percent had used cocaine. 2.5 percent had tried heroin. About 4 percent used methamphetamines. 8 percent had tried Ecstasy. Slightly more than 3 percent had used steroids. There was no overall figure for the percentage of 12th-graders who used any illegal drug. The federal National Institutes of Health has data on its website that says 42 percent of 12th-graders in 2009 had tried marijuana. The percentage had actually declined from nearly 48 percent in 2002. Officials there provided PolitiFact Georgia some data for all types of illicit drug use by 12th-graders. "In 2011, 50% of high school seniors reported having tried an illicit drug at some time, 40% used one or more drugs in the past 12 months, and 25% used one or more drugs in the prior 30 days," Shirley Simson, a media specialist for the NIH’s National Institute on Drug Abuse, told us via email. Simson said there’s been an increase in the past four years, primarily due to more teenagers smoking marijuana. The National Center for Education Statistics has data on its website that says about 47 percent of the graduating class of 2009 had tried any type of illicit drug. The percentage has declined each year since 2000, when 54 percent of high school seniors had tried drugs. We couldn’t find data about the percentage of high school seniors graduating this year who’ve smoked marijuana or have done any kind of illicit drug. The studies we’ve found show drug use among 12th-graders hovers around the 50 percent mark, with a slight decline in recent years. We rate his claim as Mostly True.

pomt-08499	Sen. Barbara Boxer "voted against immigration reform to permit (Hispanic immigrants) people to come here legally to work."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/08/susan-b-anthony-list/spanish-language-ad-claims-sen-barbara-boxer-voted/	A new Spanish language ad from the Susan B. Anthony List, a Republican group that opposes abortion, and the National Organization for Marriage, which opposes gay marriage, attacks Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., on its core issues, saying that Boxer "doesn’t share our values" because she "supports abortion and homosexual marriage." The ad, running on Spanish language TV in several large California markets, also attacks Boxer on immigration, saying she "voted against immigration reform to permit our people to come here legally to work." It's a surprising attack, given that Boxer is a well-known advocate for comprehensive immigration reform. Boxer has long favored tougher border security, but she has also advocated a path to citizenship for the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants currently in the United States. Asked for backup for the ad's claim about Boxer, a spokesman for SBA List pointed us toward a May 23, 2007, story in the New York Times that notes Boxer's opposition to a "guest worker" provision proposed for the comprehensive immigration reform initiative that year. According to the story, "Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, denounced the guest worker program, saying it would create a pool of 'desperate low-wage workers' whom employers could easily exploit." The guest worker program proposed in the 2007 immigration bill was part of the negotiated "grand bargain" that sought to get bipartisan support for the bill. The program would have allowed temporary visas for several hundred thousand immigrants to fill unskilled jobs. The visas could be renewed twice, so long as the guest worker returned to his home country for at least a year between visits. And to return, the worker would need sponsorship from an employer. Many immigration advocates feared it would create an environment where employers could abuse guest workers, because they could control whether that guest worker could return. And Boxer voted to eliminate it. A May 29, 2007, editorial in the New York Times described the guest worker provision in the bill as "an absurd employment hokey-pokey — you put your two years in, then one year out, then repeat that twice and go home forever. It would be massive indentured servitude — colonial times all over again, but without any hope of citizenship for those taking our most difficult and despised jobs." The ad doesn't explain any of this background. It merely says Boxer "voted against immigration reform to permit our people to come here legally to work." In fact, Boxer has long been a strong proponent of comprehensive immigration reform. In 2006, she voted for an immigration reform package that included a more immigrant-friendly temporary guest worker provision. In addition, while she voted against the version of the guest worker provision included in the 2007 immigration reform bill, she ultimately voted to continue debating the bill, although it subsequently died. Boxer's campaign also notes that she co-sponsored the AgJobs Act of 2009, to allow illegal immigrants who work in the fields to get temporary visas, and eventually a path to permanent residency. And in April 2010, Boxer and 15 other senators sent a letter to President Barack Obama expressing support for a bipartisan immigration reform bill this year. Marc Rosenblum, senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, said, "The ad suggests she has been an anti-immigration vote in Congress and that's not accurate. She voted against that piece of it." Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonpartisan research group that supports lower levels of immigration, said the ad "is clearly intended to convey that she’s against what advocates call 'comprehensive immigration reform' when, in fact, she’s all for the left-wing version of it ... What she voted against was the third leg of 'comprehensive immigration reform,' which is insisted on by the business and libertarian right, which is the increased importation of captive labor via guestworker programs." The immigration attack on Boxer doesn't come completely from left field. Trailing badly in polls among California's Latino voters, Republican Carly Fiorina -- who has backed Arizona's controversial immigration law -- has used similar criticisms of Boxer in an attempt to weaken the Democrat with Latino voters. According to an Oct. 6, 2010, story in the Los Angeles Times, "though Fiorina has revealed little about how she would approach immigration issues, she has sharply criticized Boxer for seeking to strip a proposed temporary worker program from federal immigration legislation in 2007 that ultimately collapsed in the Senate." We think the ad's claim about Boxer's record on immigration is highly misleading. It states simply that Boxer "voted against immigration reform to permit our people to come here legally to work." Boxer did not vote against the immigration reform bill in 2007. She voted against a provision in it that she felt would lead to the exploitation of immigrant workers.

pomt-01048	"The auto companies have now repaid taxpayers every dime and more of what my administration invested in."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/22/barack-obama/obama-says-automakers-have-paid-back-all-loans-it-/	In the run up to his 2015 State of the Union speech, President Barack Obama was once again trumpeting his administration’s intervention in Detroit. "Last month, the rescue of the auto industry officially came to an end," Obama said Jan. 7 in Detroit. "The auto companies have now repaid taxpayers every dime and more of what my administration invested in." In December, the Treasury Department announced it sold the remainder of its 54.9 million shares in Ally Financial — formerly, General Motor’s financing service, GMAC — for $1.3 billion. With the deal, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said the United States was "winding down the Auto Industry Financing Program," the federal program that saved the auto industry— or bailed it out, depending on your view. Back in 2012, we looked at Obama’s campaign claim that GM and Chrysler "repaid their loans." We said it was Half True, partially because the government still owned stock in both automakers and it was too soon to say if taxpayers would recoup their investment. But it’s two years later, and the Treasury has since sold off most of its holdings in both companies. So we decided to take a look at this issue again. There are several circumstances that make this confusing and complicated. For starters, the bailout of the auto industry started in the waning weeks of President George W. Bush’s tenure. It continued during the early months of the Obama administration. All told, the Treasury Department reported that the program cost taxpayers $79.7 billion, of which $70.4 billion was recovered. Under that estimate, the program lost about $9.3 billion. In April, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the program would end up costing about $14 billion. The Obama administration, however, makes the case that only $57.3 billion of the investment came under their watch and therefore that should be all that they’re accountable for. Let’s review the timeline, starting in 2008: Bush secured $700 billion to bailout the financial institutions under the Troubled Asset Relief Program in October 2008. In November of that year, Obama was elected and soon after met with Bush to discuss the transition. It was during those early meetings that Obama began to lobby Bush to provide some financial assistance for the auto industry, according to reports. The New York Times wrote Bush had "balked at allowing the automakers to tap into the $700 billion bailout fund, despite warnings ... that General Motors might not survive the year." A month later, Bush announced a $17.4 billion bailout for Chrysler and GM that provided short-term financial relief through March 2009. He handed off to the incoming Obama administration the decision on how the companies would have to restructure themselves. The investment would grow to about $23 billion in short-term loans by the time Bush left office. As Politico noted in December 2008, Bush’s move was a "reversal for the White House," adding that, "President-elect Barack Obama and Democrats had long advocated that course, and Bush had resisted it." The New York Times reported that Obama "embraced the plan," though he did not comment on the details. To get to Obama’s claim that the "auto companies have now repaid taxpayers every dime and more of what my administration invested in," the White House is taking credit for all of the money recovered from the auto companies in the last six years. This is somewhat problematic. Why? Obama is essentially saying ignore the money Bush invested and only look at what my administration spent on the bailout when calculating the "expenses" side of the ledger. But for Obama to make the claim he has recovered everything he invested "and more," he’s including money paid back on loans also given out under Bush. You might ask, "Why not just look to see which loans were repaid?" It’s a good question. Unfortunately, it’s a lot more complicated than that. Both GM and Chrysler went through structured bankruptcies in 2009 to remain viable. The process resulted in both automakers essentially killing off their old companies and creating New GM and New Chrysler. During that process, most of their debt was converted into preferred and common stock owned largely by the government that would gradually be sold off (in the case of Chrysler, it was acquired by Italian carmaker Fiat, while the GM stock was publicly offered and later partially bought back by New GM). Some of the dealings resulted in profit, some did not. Additionally, Old GM and Old Chrysler were saddled with some debt that has not been recovered. Because most of the debt was in stock, it’s difficult to know if the money coming back into the Treasury was from the Bush loans or from the Obama administration. At the same time, it’s possible the Treasury would not have recovered any of the investment from either administration had Obama’s White House not taken the steps to restructure the companies through a managed bankruptcy. Obama created a taskforce upon taking office to determine how to proceed with the auto companies. They had three options: no further government assistance; more loans with no strings attached; or more financial resources on the condition the companies would restructure. In both cases, the third option was chosen. The administration had a heavy hand in the restructuring, forcing the sale of Chrysler to Fiat and requiring GM to fire its CEO, close plants, shrink staff and eliminate lines like Pontiac and Saturn. The general consensus from both a legislative panel and experts is that the intervention by the administration kept both companies out of long, drawn out bankruptcies that could have resulted in the liquidation of GM and Chrysler. That likely would have impacted Ford as well (Ford didn’t take government money, but lobbied for GM and Chrysler to receive assistance, noting that the three automakers shared parts suppliers) and threatened the U.S. auto industry existence. It’s impossible to know what would have happened had the administration not stepped in. However, it’s fair to say right now both companies are profitable and American car makers are in stable positions. Additionally, a $9 billion hit is less than the $24 billion loss the Treasury predicted in 2011. Our ruling Obama said, "The auto companies have now repaid taxpayers every dime and more of what my administration invested in." We’ll note that losses from automaker loans were expected to be higher, and the action taken by the Obama administration resulted in GM and Chrysler paying back the bulk of their loans. But to say they've paid back "every dime and more," requires considerable cherry-picking. Obama doesn’t count any outstanding loans made by the Bush administration, which seem to have been made with Obama's quiet support and which were restructured (resulting in some losses) under the bankruptcy Obama's Treasury helped manage. And to get into the black, he counts money the automakers paid back for Bush administration loans. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores facts that would give a different impression. That’s Mostly False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2015-01-22T17:13:19	2015-01-07	['None']
pomt-12576	Says "2 moms, 5 kids killed in car crash" in a nearby county.	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/apr/11/countynewsroominfo/fake-news-site-alters-real-story-fiery-car-crash-t/	A fake news website looking to spread malware lured readers by altering details of a tragically true news story of a fatal car wreck that killed two women and several children. At least 22 posts we first noticed on April 10, 2017, on the website CountyNewsroom.info carried headlines that declared, "2 moms, 5 kids killed in car crash," followed by the name of a county, such as Stark County or Schuyler County. Facebook users flagged multiple versions of the story as being potentially fake, as part of the social media site’s efforts to combat fake news in user feeds. The story is fake, although it does steal details from a real event (more on that in a second). The posts at CountyNewsroom.info appear to exist to goad readers into clicking on them because a familiar county name is used. When users get to the site, however, pornographic malware can be downloaded onto their computers. We won’t be linking to any of the stories for that reason. The site made a minimal attempt to look official, using the CountyNewsroom.info domain and listing the author of the posts as "Police." The graphics used evoke breaking news from a real media outlet, and can change from post to post. Some of the articles have comments posted expressing sympathy for the victims, although it’s not entirely clear if those comments are real or not. There is no contact information on the website, but it is registered to an administrator in Tbilisi, Georgia. The small country in the Caucasus has been a growing source of multiple fake news websites since the 2016 presidential campaign. We emailed the person listed in the WHOIS lookup, but have not heard back. The story, meanwhile, gives no indication in which state it is located, but the details of the accident are identical in each version. Two men — Carter Anderson, 35, and Nathan Mcconaghy, 47 — were the sole survivors of a crash that killed their families, the posts said. According to the story, the two men were in a minivan with their families when the minivan hit a black BMW on the side of the road. The minivan was then struck from behind by "a big rig," sending the minivan toppling into a ravine. The minivan caught fire, the story read, and the two men managed to escape. Their wives and children, aged 1, 3, 6, 7 and 12 years old, were trapped and died in the fire. The men were severely burned on their hands and faces trying to rescue their families, but had to be restrained by authorities. "Words can’t describe what that was like when we arrived on scene," a law enforcement official identified only as Officer Dan Williams was quoted in the posts. "It was very horrific seeing them trying to get their families out, us trying to help get their families out. Like I said, the van went up in flames very, very quickly." The two men were airlifted to an unspecified hospital, the article said. While that particular accident is fake, the framework of the article has been taken from a real-life tragedy in June 2016 near Gorman, Calif. Some, but not all, of the details were changed. Two California men named Aaron Hon Wing Ng, 34, of San Francisco and Wei Xiong Li, 45, of Daly City were involved in a nighttime accident that happened as described in the fake post. Their wives and four children, not five, were trapped in their minivan and killed in the fiery wreck. The children were aged 2, 3, 4 and 5, and the two men did suffer burns trying to save their families. The quote is unaltered, and came from a California Highway Patrol officer named Dan Williams. Another CHP officer also is quoted in some true reporting of the incident. The author of the post made minimal changes to real news stories about the accident, using the shocking specifics to fool readers into clicking. But visitors thinking they are reading about a local accident end up being fooled into exposing their computers to an attack with pornographic software. We rate this story False.

pomt-10355	"Our National Guard, as we saw in the Midwest flooding, can't function as effectively as it could. I was talking to National Guard representatives. Fifteen of their 17 helicopters in this region were overseas during the flooding."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/09/barack-obama/no-shortage-of-choppers-for-floods/	In a news conference in Chicago, Sen. Barack Obama took a question about whether "a terror attack might be good for Senator John McCain's campaign." The theory behind the question was that McCain is a military veteran who has spent his decades in Washington developing strong foreign policy credentials. Obama answered by arguing that the policies supported by McCain and President Bush have actually made the country more vulnerable to attack: "I don't think that the Bush administration or John McCain have shaped policies that are optimal in order to deal with the terrorist threat. We're seeing backsliding in Afghanistan. We've got bin Laden sending out audio tapes. We've got interactive Internet sites that al-Qaida has put up because they've got a place where they feel relatively secure. We are weakened financially and our military is strained to the breaking point as a consequence of our incursions into Iraq. We've neglected some of the homeland security investments that we could have made here. "Our National Guard, as we saw in the Midwest flooding, can't function as effectively as it could. I was talking to National Guard representatives. Fifteen of their 17 helicopters in this region were overseas during the flooding." Obama was making two points about the Guard: First, that the strain on the Guard from fighting two foreign wars hampered its response to the June Midwest flooding; second, that the number of helicopters overseas at the time supports that conclusion. We didn't find evidence that either of these points were true. Three states affected by the flooding said his math is incorrect on the number of helicopters available to work flooding missions. Only one state had more helicopters slotted for overseas work than domestic missions. The Obama campaign didn't specify what region the candidate was referring to or where he got his information, but it acknowledged that the helicopter figure was wrong. • In Iowa, the state worst hit by the flooding, all 21 of its helicopters were stateside and available to help with the flooding. The figures for manpower show the Iowa National Guard was ready to respond as well. At the time of the flooding, about 850 service men and women were overseas. That's less than one-tenth of the state's total forces of 9,400. "We had what we needed to get the job done," said Lt. Col. Greg Hapgood, a Guard spokesman. "If we needed more people we had more to call up." Before and during the flooding, service members returned from Iraq. Now, Iowa has about 560 serving on active duty, and the majority of those aren't involved in the war on terrorism. About 330 are on a peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, about 140 are in Iraq and 90 on the Sinai Peninsula, Hapgood said. • Missouri National Guard spokeswoman Capt. Tammy Spicer said the Missouri Guard has 10 Black Hawk helicopters that are on their way to Iraq. That leaves them with eight choppers to work the flooding. "Every request for aviation support that has been passed to the Missouri National Guard for this particular disaster has been met," Spicer said. Kansas had offered aviation support, but Missouri didn't need it. For personnel, the Missouri Guard has 11,500 soldiers and airmen, about 1,800 of which are mobilized for the war on terrorism. The largest number, about 1,000, are in Kosovo, followed by Iraq and Afghanistan. • Mike Chrisman, spokesman for the Illinois National Guard, said eight of the state's eighteen helicopters are overseas in Kosovo. They've been using only three of the available helicopters for flooding missions. And the helicopters that are overseas aren't even in Iraq. "We've had the assets," Chrisman said. "We would have had more had they asked for more." Illinois has about 13,000 National Guard soldiers and airmen, with about 800 in Iraq and Afghanistan. Later this year, about 2,700 National Guard soldiers will deploy to Afghanistan, the state's biggest overseas deployment since World War II. Still, the flooding required only about 1,400 soldiers. Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for Obama, conceded in an e-mail that the 15 out of 17 figure on helicopters was inaccurate, but he did not provide more specifics on where the information came from. "The exact data point on helicopters that was relayed to Senator Obama was off, but the sentiment behind his statement was correct – that the Iraq war is overstretching our national guard," Vietor wrote. We're not sure exactly what "region" Obama was referring to, but the numbers for the states affected by flooding don't match up at all. We understand Obama's larger point, and explore it in this story about the readiness of the National Guard. But he chose a terrible example in the Midwest floods to illustrate that larger point. The fact is his facts wrong, so we say False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-07-09T00:00:00	2008-06-25	['Midwestern_United_States', 'National_Guard_of_the_United_States']
pomt-01922	When asked by a reporter whether he’s at the center of a "criminal scheme" to violate campaign laws, Gov. Scott Walker nodded yes.	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jun/27/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/democratic-party-video-ad-scott-walker-nods-yes-wh/	Five days after an unsealed legal brief spelled out John Doe prosecutors’ suspicions that Gov. Scott Walker helped run a "criminal scheme" to violate campaign laws, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin posted a web video. The video, "Wisconsin Deserves Better," ends with a question-and-answer segment in which Walker appears to acknowledge guilt. That sequence starts with audio of part of a question asked of Walker by reporter Charles Benson of WTMJ-TV, the NBC affiliate in Milwaukee. He was among a group of reporters seeking Walker’s reaction on June 19, 2014, after the legal brief came out as part of a lawsuit by a conservative group under investigation in the Doe probe. Benson, not shown at first, is heard saying to Walker: "...that you are the center of a criminal scheme. Are you?" Abruptly, the audio goes out, the video goes to slow motion, and Walker nods his head up and down with eyes closed and sort of a grim look on his face. "Our State Deserves Better" appears on the screen as the video ends without any verbal evidence of Walker’s response to Benson. The video is on the party’s YouTube channel, and was promoted on its Facebook page and state party’s website. Tale of the tape At the bottom of the screen during the sequence with Benson and Walker, the video credit appears to be WEAU-TV, the NBC affiliate in Eau Claire. The station picked up the feed from WTMJ and aired it June 20. But the report originally aired on WTMJ, so we looked at the station’s segment regarding the release of the prosecution’s brief and Walker’s reaction. We examined the relevant parts of the TMJ interview, and the Dem video, and created our own video with those clips back to back. In the WTMJ segment, anchors introduce the story and then go to Benson, who says, "Well, the new documents are public after conservative groups sued in Federal Court to stop the investigation. Prosecutors allege a criminal scheme. Walker says the allegations from a partisan Milwaukee D.A. are false." After showing some highlights of the prosecution’s theory of the case, the segment cuts to Benson questioning Walker. It’s the complete version of the sequence truncated by the Dems in their video. The first tipoff to the fact that the Dem video is manipulated: In the WTMJ segment, unlike in the Dem video, Benson is on screen when he asks Walker: "Prosecutors in the John Doe investigation allege that you are at the center of a criminal scheme. Are you?" "No," Walker says immediately, shaking his head side to side. The WTMJ segments cuts away at that point, back to Benson, who says: "Walker says no laws were broken, and the case was rejected by two judges who have reviewed the allegations." Finally, WTMJ cuts back to the reporters interviewing Walker, who is shown saying, "And I asked people to look at the facts, and the facts are pretty clear. A judge at the state and the federal level made it clear that they didn’t buy into this argument. They said to move on." It doesn’t take a degree in YouTube to see that Walker actually bobbed his head "yes" during Benson’s question, not in response to Benson. (As those who follow Walker know, he uses the head bob frequently when listening to people as he campaigns or when taking in reporters’ questions.) We asked Democratic Party of Wisconsin chairman Mike Tate about the discrepancy between the two videos. Tate referred us to party spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff, who acknowledged that it appears Walker shakes his head yes in the party’s video. It wasn’t intentional or an attempt to mislead, Baldauff said. The party was trying to "layer together clips" of news coverage of the Doe issue and about the jobs reports that came out the same week, she said. Walker campaign spokesman Tom Evenson wasn’t buying that explanation Friday. "This Democrat Party propaganda is another attempt to mislead the voters from the facts and distract from Mary Burke's failed record as Jim Doyle's commerce secretary," Evenson said, referring to Walker’s leading Democratic Party challenger in the fall governor’s race. WTMJ news director Janet Hundley and WEAU general manager Terry McHugh assisted PolitiFact in locating video of the Walker segment. Neither wanted to comment on the Dem video. Our rating A Democratic Party web video making the rounds on social media shows a grim-faced Gov. Scott Walker appearing to bob his head yes to a reporter’s question about whether he was at the center of a "criminal scheme" to evade campaign finance laws. In real life, the governor answered an emphatic "no" -- not surprising given he’s been denying any wrongdoing since new documents were released in the John Doe investigation. The Dem video, in its editing of the WTMJ clip, leaves the viewer with the misleading and ridiculous impression that Walker is somehow admitting guilt in the case. That’s the definition of Pants on Fire.	None	Democratic Party of Wisconsin	None	None	None	2014-06-27T17:39:00	2014-06-24	['None']
pomt-14631	Neighbors of the San Bernardino shooters "knew that they were talking about trying to take our country and attack it."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/28/chris-christie/christie-says-neighbors-san-bernardino-shooters-kn/	The threat to the United States from Islamic terrorists was a lead-off topic in the Republican debate in Iowa, and the December shootings in San Bernardino, Calif., was a prime example of how real that threat can be. Fox News moderator Megyn Kelly asked New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie about the reluctance of the shooters’ neighbors to report suspicious activity by Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik. They didn't want to be seen as using ethnic profiling. Christie said what the neighbors saw had nothing to do with profiling. "These folks had weapons, they knew that they were talking about trying to take our country and attack it," Christie said. "That's not profiling, that's law enforcement." Kelly interjected, "They didn't know they were going to attack the country." "They knew they were talking about attacking people," Christie shot back. We looked for any reports of the neighbors saying they had an inkling of any plans for an attack. We didn’t find any. We did find second-hand reports that weren’t well sourced, and these were repeated primarily on right-leaning news websites. This excerpt from the conservative website Daily Caller was typical: "A neighbor of Farook’s mother in Redland — said that another neighbor told him "they had I guess been receiving packages — quite a few packages within a short amount of time, and they were actually doing a lot of work out in the garage." "She was kind of suspicious and wanted to report it," Elswick explained, "but she said she didn’t want to profile." There were many articles of this sort. All of them sourced back to a local ABC news affiliate broadcast and all of them had pretty much the same details. None of these accounts supports Christie’s assertion. First, they talk about what the neighbors of Farook’s mother saw, not the neighbors of Farook and Malik themselves. The mother lived in Redlands, not San Bernardino. We should also note that this account comes from a neighbor saying what he learned from another neighbor, not what he saw himself. Second, no one was reported as saying that they thought an attack was being planned. Soon after the shooting, the Wall Street Journal reported that neighbors and friends described the couple as "quiet, religious people who didn’t attract attention or suspicion." Our ruling Christie said that neighbors of the San Bernardino shooters knew that they were talking about attacking the country. The most that was reported is that a neighbor of a neighbor of one of the shooter’s mother said there was suspicious activity. There was no mention that a neighbor of the shooters themselves was suspicious, much less that a neighbor thought an attack was being planned. Christie jumbled the details in the news. We rate this statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/18d28985-9171-4758-ba6d-6f150b004517	None	Chris Christie	None	None	None	2016-01-28T23:07:14	2016-01-28	['San_Bernardino,_California']
pomt-10934	Says Sen. Joe Donnelly’s "family got caught outsourcing jobs to Mexico, and ‘Mexico Joe’ profited up to $80,000."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/26/senate-leadership-fund/did-donnelly-profit-his-familys-outsourcing/	A super PAC with ties to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is attacking incumbent Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly in a new ad, referring to the vulnerable Democrat as "Mexico Joe." The Senate Leadership Fund ad accuses Donnelly of padding his congressional salary with money from a family company. Donnelly’s "family got caught outsourcing jobs to Mexico, and ‘Mexico Joe’ profited up to $80,000." The ad concludes, "Outsourcing jobs to Mexico. American jobs at risk. Joe Donnelly profits." We decided to investigate the ad’s statement about Donnelly earning $80,000 from his family after they were "caught outsourcing." Here’s what happened Donnelly is running for re-election in 2018 against Republican businessman Mike Braun. Republicans see Donnelly’s seat as a potential pickup given that Indiana voted for President Donald Trump in 2016. The company at the center of the ad is Stewart Superior Corporation, which sells scrapbooking and paper crafting supplies, such as stamps and ink pads, and is owned by Donnelly’s brother, Jack. Stewart Superior is based in California, with an office in England and a manufacturing plant in Indiana. In 2011, the company opened an additional manufacturing plant in Mexico, according to import records from trade date company Panjiva. Jack Donnelly’s company operated without much noteriety from 2011 to 2017. Meanwhile, his brother Sen. Joe Donnelly often spoke publicly about stopping the practice of outsourcing jobs. He even proposed the End Outsourcing Act in January 2017. If passed, the measure would require businesses to publicly announce if layoffs were due to outsourcing and to offer tax incentives to businesses who maintain U.S. production. Things came to a head in July 2017, when the Associated Press reported that Donnelly, vocal critic of outsourcing, owned stock in his brother’s company, which operated a manufacturing plant in Mexico. Critics have used his involvement with Stewart Superior, which is capitalizing on the labor practices that Donnelly criticized, as proof of his hypocrisy. Donnelly has not been listed as an officer of the company in Indiana business entity reports since 2005. According to a 2006 interview with the South Bend Tribune, Donnelly has not had an active role in the company since 1997. He had previously served as a corporate officer and general counsel for Stewart Superior, and started his own small business, Marking Solutions, Inc. A month after the AP report, Donnelly sold his stock for $17,410, according to a report by the Indianapolis Business Journal. Will Baskin-Gerwitz, a spokesman for the Donnelly Senate campaign, said Donnelly did not know the company had opened a factory in Mexico until the AP reported it in July. In a July 2017 radio interview, published after the AP story, Donnelly claimed that his brother had "never outsourced a single job" — meaning Stewart Superior did not lay off workers in the United States to replace them with cheaper labor in Mexico. The Senate Leadership Fund told us that Stewart Superior outsourced jobs whether or not it laid off workers in the United States. Outsourcing U.S. jobs, or expanding? When an American company has layoffs of at least 500 employees or at least 33 percent of the workforce, the employer must issue a notice under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act. These notifications are filed with the state. In both California and Indiana, the two states where Stewart Superior has American employees, there are no WARN notices on record. Workers who lose their job to outsourcing are also eligible to petition to receive Trade Adjustment Assistance Program benefits. No one from Stewart Superior has petitioned since 1998, when a single case was rejected. What does that suggest? If Stewart Superior did lay off employees when it opened its manufacturing plant in Mexico, the layoffs affected fewer than 33 percent of jobs and none of the workers applied for government assistance. However, it is still possible that some number of workers were laid off. Stewart Superior would not respond to questions. Bottom line: Stewart Superior certainly hired workers in Mexico, but it’s unclear if it was part of an expansion or at the expense of workers in the United States. And if so, how many. $80,000 profit unsubstantiated The second part of the Senate Leadership Fund claim is that Donnelly Mexico profited up to $80,000 on outsourcing jobs to Mexico. The reality is the Senate Leadership Fund is referring to money Donnelly made in stock dividends he owned in his brother’s company. Between 2011 and 2017, Donnelly submitted yearly financial disclosure reports. These show his earnings from dividends, which are annual cuts of a company’s profits given to certain shareholders. In 2014 and 2015, Donnelly reported earning between $5,000 and $15,000 in dividends from his stock in Stewart Superior. In 2016, he reported earning between $15,000 and $50,000. Donnelly had also owned stock prior to 2013, but it had been valued below reporting thresholds. The Senate Leadership Fund reaches $80,000 by taking the maximum figure in the range each year: $15,000 in 2014 and 2015, and $50,000 in 2016. If he had been earning the minimum value in the range, he would have made $25,000. To make $80,000, Donnelly’s earnings would have had to jump from $15,000 in 2015 to $50,000 in 2016. Experts say that is improbable based on the $17,400 the Indianapolis Business Journal reported he sold his stock for. According to Louisiana State University finance professor Don Chance, annual dividends are generally only worth a small percentage of the stock. Publicly traded companies will give stockholders an annual dividend worth between 0.5 percent to 4 percent of their stock. Stocks in Home Depot worth $17,000, for instance, would earn just $347 per year in dividends. So, how is it possible that Donnelly’s stock in Stewart Superior, which was worth $17,000 when he sold it, made somewhere between $25,000 and $80,000 over three years? The stock’s value may have fluctuated over time, but we know that it was worth no more than $50,000, based on Donnelly’s financial disclosures. Because Stewart Superior is not a publicly traded company, very little information is available about its investors or financial status. If his stocks were truly worth $17,000 and Donnelly earned only $25,000 from them, he would have received a dividend return of nearly 50 percent. Even if his stocks were valued at the highest possible amount within the range, $50,000, his return rate would have been about 16 percent, which is incredibly high. "The $25,000 number is ridiculously out of line," Chance said. "And the $80,000 even more so." Donnelly’s campaign was uncertain why the return rate for his dividends was so high. Our ruling The Senate Leadership Fund said Joe Donnelly's "family got caught outsourcing jobs to Mexico, and ‘Mexico Joe’ profited up to $80,000." The ad also says "American jobs at risk." A company owned by Donnelly’s brother, Stewart Superior, opened a manufacturing plant in Mexico in 2011. It is not clear if U.S. jobs were lost as a result. Donnelly's connection to the company in 2011 appears to be that he held stock. As far as Donnelly's profits, the Senate Leadership Fund is highlighting only the high-end of the range he reported as earning in stock dividends. It would be accurate to say he earned between $25,000 and $80,000 by holding stock in his brother's company. This claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. UPDATE (July 26): After we published this fact-check, the Senate Leadership Fund said it believed Stewart Superior outsourced jobs whether or not U.S. workers were laid off.

pomt-05500	"While the country’s economy was battered, nine states with no income tax actually grew jobs from 2001 to 2010."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/apr/16/bettylou-decroce/bettylou-decroce-claims-states-without-income-taxe/	Though the job market is bleak for some, a Republican assemblywoman claims Gov. Chris Christie’s proposed income tax cut promises a brighter future. BettyLou DeCroce, a Republican representing parts of Morris, Essex and Passaic counties, recently penned a column touting Christie’s proposal to reduce personal income tax rates by 10 percent over three years. "We need to build momentum with an across-the-board tax cut to boost the recovery and give New Jersey a competitive advantage in attracting new jobs to our state," DeCroce wrote in an April 8 column in the Gloucester County Times. "While the country’s economy was battered, nine states with no income tax actually grew jobs from 2001 to 2010. If states without an income tax added jobs during the Great Recession, imagine how many more jobs New Jersey can grow by reducing taxes during the recovery. The next job created could be yours," she said. With several tax cut plans swirling around Trenton, DeCroce’s claim caught our attention. Have states with no personal income tax fared better than the nation on job growth? The nation lost more than two million jobs from 2001 to 2010, according to federal labor data. On average states without a personal income tax experienced job growth, but two of those states lost jobs. And the connection between income taxes and job growth is murky. Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, Washington and Wyoming do not levy a personal income tax. New Hampshire and Tennessee only tax interest and dividend income. Greg Volpe, a spokesman for the Assembly Republicans, pointed to a Wall Street Journal article from February about governors pushing to cut or abolish their state’s personal income tax and a report from the American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative group based in Washington, D.C. The group’s 2012 report found that on average the nine states without personal income taxes experienced employment growth of 5.36 percent during the last decade. But New Hampshire and Tennessee actually lost jobs during the same time frame. And other states the report identified as having high personal income tax rates, such as Hawaii and Maryland, gained jobs from 2001 to 2010. DeCroce called those states "statistical outliers" and said in a written statement they "do not change the fact that states with no personal income tax were more successful in creating jobs than high-tax states during the last decade." But Richard Pomp, a professor of law at the University of Connecticut and state taxation expert said, "you can’t bury bad news with good news. You have to take those as contradictions. Right away it shows you it’s not uniform. There’s more going on than just whether there’s an income tax or not." Pomp noted population growth and natural resources as other factors. Alan Auerbach, professor of economics and law at University of California, Berkeley, said in an e-mail that grouping states without a personal income tax is "OK if one wants a summary measure of growth in those states, but the exercise of trying to explain growth differences using just one factor doesn't make a lot of sense, particularly when one is considering a relatively short period of time." DeCroce said although others "may have different economic opinions, I still believe the best way to grow jobs in New Jersey is by reducing government spending and cutting income taxes." Our ruling DeCroce said in an opinion column: "While the country’s economy was battered, nine states with no income tax actually grew jobs from 2001 to 2010." A conservative group found that on average states that don’t levy personal income taxes had more job growth during the past decade than the national average. But the absence of an income tax isn’t the only factor driving growth. In fact, two of the nine states without personal income taxes lost jobs between 2001 and 2010. And two states the conservative group points out as having high personal income tax rates gained jobs during the same decade. We rate this claim Half True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-10605	"I was fighting against those (Republican) ideas when you were practicing law and representing your contributor, Rezko, in his slum landlord business in inner city Chicago."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/22/hillary-clinton/a-fragment-of-truth-distorted/	In one of the most heated exchanges of the Democratic debates, Hillary Clinton on Monday night fired off this pointed attack on Barack Obama: "I was fighting against those (Republican) ideas when you were practicing law and representing your contributor, Rezko, in his slum landlord business in inner city Chicago." Asked later to respond, Obama said, "Here's what happened: I was an associate at a law firm that represented a church group that had partnered with this individual to do a project and I did about five hours worth of work on this joint project." The man in question here is Antoin "Tony" Rezko, a Chicago real estate developer and fast food magnate now under federal indictment. He's also a longtime friend of Obama who over the years did a good amount of fundraising for him. In April 2007, the Chicago Sun-Times reported that Obama did some legal work between 1995 and 1998 on a series of troubled low-income housing deals involving Rezmar Corp., owned by Rezko. Reporter Tim Novak reported that Obama was an associate attorney with the small Chicago law firm, Davis Miner Barnhill & Galland, that helped Rezmar and not-for-profit community groups secure more than $43-million in government funding to rehab 15 apartment buildings for the poor. Four ended up in foreclosure. In all, Novak reported, Rezmar rehabbed 30 buildings, a third of which were in the Illinois Senate district Obama represented between 1997 and 2004. Many of the buildings fell into squalid disrepair and financial straits while Obama was state senator, prompting the city to repeatedly sue over problems, including no heat. Obama's campaign staff told the Sun-Times that Obama worked on some of the deals, but that his Rezmar-related work amounted to just five hours. "The senator, relatively inexperienced in this kind of work, was assigned to tasks appropriate for a junior lawyer,'' according to an e-mail from Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs. "These tasks would have included reviewing documents, collecting corporate organizational documents, and drafting corporate resolutions.'' In fact, Gibbs wrote, "Senator Obama does not remember having conversations with Tony (Rezko) about properties that he owned or any specific issues related to those properties.'' Obama told the Sun-Times that he often got complaints as a state senator about housing problems but, "As far as I can tell, we were never contacted by (Rezko) tenants." It was the latest in a string of embarrassing stories that linked Obama to Rezko, who was indicted in the fall of 2006 on unrelated federal charges that accuse him of fraud, attempted extortion and money laundering. Prosecutors say Rezko's scheme was to get campaign money and payoffs from investment companies seeking to do business with two Illinois state boards. His trial could begin as early as February 2008. In November 2006, the Chicago Tribune detailed a 2005 real estate deal in which Obama bought a sliver of vacant land adjacent to his home from Rezko's wife. Although he paid fair market price for the land, Obama later called the deal "boneheaded" on his part, as it came at a time when Rezko was widely known to be under federal investigation. Rezko also has been a longtime, key fundraiser for Obama, dating back to Obama's campaigns to become an Illinois senator. In 2003, Rezko even hosted a cocktail party fundraiser for Obama. In an effort to create distance, the Obama campaign has pledged that any money from Rezko or donors linked to him will go to charity. "Mr. Rezko gave me campaign contributions,'' Obama told the Chicago Sun-Times. "While I was a state senator, he had buildings in my district that apparently were not managed properly. I had no knowledge of that at the time.'' Bottom line, Clinton's claim is Barely True. Obama, by his own admission, did some, albeit very little, legal work that helped Rezko's company obtain properties that would later be neglected. But the allegations that Rezko was a slumlord did not arise, at least not publicly, until years after Obama performed that work. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-05432	The Wisconsin law repealed by Republicans, which allowed discriminated workers to sue in state court, "was kind of a gravy train" for lawyers.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/apr/27/scott-walker/recall-target-wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-says-work/	When PolitiFact Wisconsin first wrote about an attempt by Republicans to repeal a law that allowed discriminated workers to sue in state court, we found a surprising statistic: The law had been in effect for nearly three years, but no such lawsuits had been filed. And yet a month later, days after signing a repeal of the law, GOP Gov. Scott Walker suggested the law had been a financial windfall for attorneys. "In the past, it was kind of a gravy train for the trial bar," the governor told the Wisconsin Radio Network on April 10, 2012. He added: "The only change (the repeal) really makes is it no longer includes the benefit that was in place before for lawyers." We know Walker stopped the high-speed trains that were headed to Wisconsin. But had there also been a "gravy train" running cash to plaintiffs’ attorneys? Walker’s claim relates to the "war on women" that Democrats say Walker and the GOP are waging in the run-up to the June 2012 gubernatorial recall election. So we decided to take a look. First, two points of background. -- In March 2012, we gave a Mostly False to state Rep. Cory Mason, D-Racine, for saying the old law, approved in June 2009 when Democrats controlled Madison, ensured that women could not be paid less than men for doing the same job. Act 20 allowed discriminated workers -- after proving discrimination to a state agency -- to sue their employers in state court for compensatory and punitive damages. Previously, they could sue only in federal court. -- On the same day of Walker’s radio interview, we gave Democratic recall candidate Kathleen Falk a False for saying the GOP repeal of the old law meant women "can’t do something about" pay discrimination. Discriminated workers can still seek "make whole" remedies from state as well as federal agencies. And for most types of discrimination, employees who work for an employer who has 15 or more employees can sue for larger damages in federal court. Now to Walker’s claim. Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie acknowledged that no state court lawsuits were filed while the old law was in effect. So, clearly lawyers weren’t getting paid based on their clients winning discrimination cases in state court. But Werwie argued that the law was still a "kind of a gravy train" for lawyers because they could extract settlements from employers by threatening to sue in state court. Some attorneys who represent workers say the system for suing in state court under the old law was easier and less expensive than suing in federal court, plus it applied to more types of discrimination, so that law gave workers some advantages. Employers would pay settlements, Werwie said, to avoid perhaps years’ worth of legal fees and the chance of having to pay up to $300,000 (for large employers) in damages if they lost at trial. (The same limits on damages apply to suits filed in federal court.) Werwie made three points: 1. Old law led to costly settlements At an October 2011 Senate committee hearing on the Republicans’ repeal legislation -- Act 219 -- Wisconsin Restaurant Association lobbyist Pete Hanson said that shortly after the old law took effect, one restaurant agreed to pay a roughly $50,000 settlement on a claim that typically would have been settled for a fraction of that because of the potential cost of a lawsuit. He said the case had been working its way through the state agency system when the 2009 law took effect. However, that example does not quite fit the facts. When the law was passed, it said it could only be applied to future cases -- not those already in the pipeline. 2. Lawyers wanted old law Werwie cited 2009 testimony in support of the old law by Madison attorney Paul Kinne, who represented the Wisconsin Association for Justice, formerly the Wisconsin Academy of Trial Lawyers. Kinne argued that workers needed the ability to sue in state court in order to fully pursue their discrimination cases. "Limited damages make it very difficult to bring discrimination cases," Kinne wrote. "Attorneys turn down dozens of cases because damages are limited and most people cannot afford to pay hourly fees." Like Werwie’s first point, this one does not provide hard evidence that the law was a financial boon for lawyers. But both points suggest a more favorable scenario for lawyers under the old law: The threat of a state lawsuit gave plaintiffs more options in bringing a discrimination case against an employer. 3. Lawyers, unions backed old law Werwie noted that, of six organizations that lobbied for the 2009 law, one was the trial lawyers group and four were unions. But that, too, does not support the "gravy train" statement. The interest of the unions, presumably, was their members who might be discriminated against. And, as was noted from the start, the law did not produce any lawsuits in nearly three years. Our rating Walker said a law that allowed workplace discrimination lawsuits to be filed in state court, which he and the Legislature repealed, was "kind of a gravy train" for lawyers. His statement contains some element of truth, in that the old law gave another legal option to lawyers who represent workers claiming discrimination. But Walker’s claim ignores critical facts -- or, put another way, lacks critical facts -- that would support his claim of a big financial gain for lawyers. After all, not a single lawsuit was filed in state court since the law took effect. We rate Walker’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-12483	"General Flynn got his clearance from the Obama administration."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/may/02/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-michael-flynn-got-security-clear/	President Donald Trump says that when Michael Flynn joined his campaign, President Barack Obama’s administration had already given him a once-over. In an April 30 interview on CBS, Trump framed this detail as an inconvenient fact that the media is ignoring in order to prop up their "phony" storyline about Trump associates’ ties to Russia. "In fact, I just heard where General Flynn got his clearance from the Obama administration," he said. "And when he went to Russia, I didn't realize this, when he went to Russia, it was 2015, and he was on the Obama clearance." Flynn, a former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency under Obama, was ousted from his Trump administration role as national security adviser after it came to light that Flynn had lied about the nature of his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Now he’s the focus of a tangential controversy, complete with an investigation by the Pentagon’s watchdog, over payments he received from foreign governments, including Russia. We were interested in Trump’s statement that the Obama administration approved Flynn for security clearance, especially given that he was forced out of his Obama-era role in 2014. We found that Trump has it right. But that doesn’t affect the main allegation against Flynn: that he didn’t properly disclose payments he received from Russia, as required by law and Pentagon policy. Nor does it excuse any oversights the Trump team made while considering Flynn for a White House role. Flynn’s foreign affairs Flynn, a retired lieutenant general, spent his career as an intelligence officer in the Army, serving in both Iraq and Afghanistan and as director of intelligence for U.S. Central Command, among other posts. Obama promoted him to director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) in April 2012. Flynn retired from the agency in August 2014; news reports at the time said Flynn was forced out because he ruffled feathers with his management style. Since his departure, he has said he was fired for "calling our enemies radical jihadis." In 2015, Flynn received more than $56,000 from three Russian entities — $33,750 from state-backed media outlet RT, $11,250 from an air cargo company, and $11,250 from a cybersecurity firm — according to documents released by Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee. In 2016, during the election, Flynn’s consulting firm earned more than $500,000 to work on projects that benefited the Turkish government. This became public knowledge in March 2017, when the firm filed papers to the Justice Department to retroactively register as a foreign agent. Several months after Flynn left the DIA in 2014, he received a letter from the agency providing guidance on what he can and can’t do as an Army retiree. The letter, which Flynn himself requested, says "foreign compensation requires advance approval," per the Constitution’s emoluments clause. Despite the letter, Flynn did not disclose to the government the payments he received from the Russian entities, according to Cummings and his Republican counterpart on the oversight committee, Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah. An April 7 letter from the DIA to Cummings and Chaffetz said the agency "did not locate any records referring or relating to LTG Flynn’s receipt of money from a foreign source" nor "any records of LTG Flynn seeking permission or approval for the receipt of money from a foreign source." Flynn’s lawyer responded, saying Flynn briefed the Defense Department on his RT speaking event. But the lawyer did not specifically say whether Flynn disclosed the payments. Here’s how Trump’s claim about Flynn’s security clearances fits in. Retired military officials can keep their security clearances, with periodic background checks. Flynn’s last two background checks to retain his security clearance took place during the Obama administration, in June 2010 and January 2016, according to the April 7 DIA letter. Cummings and Chaffetz said Flynn didn’t report his 2015 earnings from Russian entities on his 2016 application. (The DIA provided Cummings and Chaffetz with portions of Flynn’s completed form, but the pages haven’t been made public.) The security clearance application asks extensively about applicants’ foreign contacts, activities, business and travel. The penalty for knowingly falsifying or concealing information on the form is a fine or up to five years in prison. The evaluating agency may also deny the person a security clearance. Even if an applicant is candid about their foreign dealings, the evaluating agency could deny security clearance if it seems like those activities could compromise the applicant’s judgment or loyalty to the United States, said Andrew Kent, a national security expert and law professor at Fordham University. White House press secretary Sean Spicer has used the fact that Flynn got through security clearance under the Obama administration to deflect blame for not properly vetting Flynn before Trump named him national security adviser. Democrats, like Cummings and Obama-era National Security Adviser Susan Rice, have said Spicer’s critique is unfair. They said Flynn’s security clearance re-evaluation was a routine process that took place several rungs below the White House, and besides, Trump is obligated to vet his advisers himself. Kent said that if those evaluating Flynn’s 2016 application had some knowledge of his Russian activities, they might deserve some blame for not pressing Flynn for more details. Because Flynn’s relationship with RT was public knowledge months before Trump was putting his White House team together, the transition team was "in a different position than the security clearance investigators." Our ruling Trump said, "General Flynn got his clearance from the Obama administration." The last two times Flynn applied for a security clearance, in 2010 and 2016, Obama was president. Lawmakers allege Flynn omitted important information about payments received from Russia on his 2016 application to renew his clearance. But that doesn’t change the fact that Trump’s statement is literally accurate. We rate Trump’s claim True.

pomt-05629	Says only seven percent of 2009’s stimulus bill went toward transportation projects, yet they created over one-third of the bill’s total jobs.	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2012/mar/23/peter-defazio/did-transportation-projects-create-more-one-third-/	U.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio didn’t care for President Barack Obama’s stimulus package in 2009 -- he said it contained too many tax cuts -- but Oregon’s 4th District congressman likes what it did for transportation. Or rather, what transportation did for the stimulus. In a guest column posted on The Hill’s Congress Blog, DeFazio wrote that if more stimulus money had gone to transportation, more Americans would have jobs: "Even 2009’s stimulus legislation was proof that transportation investment, no matter how minimal, creates jobs. Only seven percent of that bill was dedicated toward transportation projects, yet it created over one-third of the bill’s total jobs." A relatively small investment yields more than a third of jobs? That’s a compelling argument, and we wanted to know if DeFazio was right. We had two facts to verify: Did transportation take up a mere 7 percent of the stimulus package and, more importantly, did it provide one-third of the jobs created by that package? Congress approved the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 in February of that year. It distributed $787 billion through a mix of tax cuts and benefits; money for federal contracts; and money to states. Last year, the $787 billion estimate was increased to $840 billion. The stimulus is so ripe for fact checks that PolitiFact has nine pages devoted to stimulus-related statements. Here’s a great one from House Speaker John Boehner from July 2009: "In Wisconsin, the stimulus paid for a bridge to a bar called Rusty's Backwater Saloon. They've got great burgers, but no new jobs." (That earned a Mostly False.) The U.S. Department of Transportation received $48 billion of the money, or roughly 6 percent. That’s lower than the 7 percent DeFazio cited so we find it close enough to be accurate. Jobs created or sustained is trickier. PolitiFact has ruled in the past that it’s not accurate to say that no jobs were created by the stimulus, but that it’s not entirely fair for politicians to count as fact the high end of job estimates put out by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. PolitiFact Oregon checked five sources to see if any backed up DeFazio’s claim that transportation projects resulted in more than one-third of the jobs: Recovery.gov: The recovery act’s website tracks stimulus spending and breaks it down by agency and subject. Every quarter it reports on self-reported jobs funded by the stimulus for that time period, but it doesn’t track the total number of jobs created. What we can do is pick a snapshot in time to see how many of jobs came from Transportation. In the fourth quarter of 2011, for example, Transportation accounted for 26,000 of 204,000 full-time-equivalent jobs funded. That’s 13 percent, not anywhere close to one-third. In fact, we checked every quarter and found transportation agency projects accounted for anywhere from 5 percent of jobs reported for that period, to a high of 13 percent. This does not back up DeFazio’s claim. Congressional Budget Office: The nonpartisan office issues a quarterly report on the broader effects of the stimulus on employment and economic output, but it doesn’t filter by agency. Its latest report issued last month shows the stimulus in the last quarter of 2011 increased the number of people employed by between 300,000 and 2.0 million. This, too, does not validate DeFazio’s claim. U.S. Department of Transportation: You’d think that the agency itself would have jobs figures related to stimulus spending and how it compares. It does not. U.S. Government Accountability Office: The office audits numbers as reported to the Recovery Act. A June 201 report on transportation infrastructure finds transportation projects supported between 31,460 and 65,110 full-time-equivalent positions each quarter from October 2009 through March 2011. But again, that’s not a cumulative figure. It’s just a snapshot of each quarter, as we did above. The White House Council of Economic Advisers: Also every quarter, the council issues a report on the effect of the stimulus. It’s most recent report "estimates that as of the second quarter of 2011, the ARRA has raised employment relative to what it otherwise would have been by between 2.2 and 4.2 million." Still, there’s no breakdown by agency so no evidence for DeFazio’s jobs claim. Just how does DeFazio back up his claim? Two ways. First, his office points to various reports by the Congressional Budget Office and the Council of Economic Advisers that the stimulus has created about 3 million jobs. (Readers should take those figures with caveats, but there are private studies to back up the magnitude of 3 million, as included in the latest CEA report.) Second, his office provided a link to a report prepared by House Democratic Transportation staff in which they used a multiplier to conclude that $64 billion of transportation and infrastructure investment "will create or sustain more than 1.8 million jobs." How did they get that figure? By using a 2007 Federal Highway Administration formula that links every $1 billion in federal spending to 34,779 jobs, direct and indirect. We’re not even going to get into the fact that DeFazio lumped together transportation and infrastructure spending. He’s pulled a multiplier projection and attached that to a high-end jobs estimate to conclude that transportation and infrastructure jobs account for one-third of all stimulus jobs. Using this methodology, you could just as easily claim that the projects accounted for two-thirds of all jobs. We find no other authority to back up the claim that transportation stimulus spending "created over one-third of the bill’s total jobs." Not the U.S. Department of Transportation, Congressional Budget Office, White House Council of Economic Advisers, Government Accountability Office or the people who tally the job reports for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. We won’t even get into the argument of jobs created or sustained. Asked to respond to our findings, DeFazio provided a statement saying that unemployment would have been lower had more of the stimulus focused on transportation and infrastructure projects. "My point is pretty clear in the op-ed. Transportation investments have a proven high rate of return when it comes to job creation. The stimulus highlighted the difference between transportation infrastructure investments and consumptive tax cuts." We will grant the statement contains a smidgen of truth -- he has a report that projects 1.8 million jobs created or sustained, using a multiplier -- but it ignores critical facts that show otherwise. We rate the statement Mostly False.	None	Peter DeFazio	None	None	None	2012-03-23T17:09:32	2012-02-22	['None']
pomt-04897	Says his plan to end the toll on Ga. 400 fulfills his campaign promise to commuters.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2012/aug/06/nathan-deal/deal-claim-he-fulfilled-toll-promise-needs-major-r/	Gov. Nathan Deal is trying to turn the Ga. 400 toll from a symbol of broken promises to one of promises kept. Commuters fumed in 2010 when state officials reneged on a pledge to end the 50-cent toll by the following year. Instead, they extended it to 2020. Some blame this move for sealing the fate of the failed bid to raise taxes to fund a transportation overhaul for metro Atlanta. Deal, then vying for the governor’s seat, seized on the issue. He promised voters he’d tear down the toll by the end of 2011. The tollbooths still stand, but now Deal’s recent announcement that the toll will come down during his term has him crowing that he kept his campaign pledge. "Fulfilling his promise to commuters, Gov. Nathan Deal today announced that he will have the state pay off its bond debt on Dec. 1, 2013, and move rapidly after that to remove the Ga. 400 toll by the end of that year," Deal’s office announced in a news release July 19. This perplexed us. Late last year, Deal earned a Promise Broken on our Deal-O-Meter for failing to meet the 2011 deadline. Did we miss something? We put Deal’s claim that he fulfilled his promise on the Truth-O-Meter. First, let’s review Deal’s original pledge. On June 22, 2010, his campaign issued a news release that said "he'll move quickly as governor to bring down the Georgia 400 toll before the end of 2011." "The state has collected more than enough money to pay for the bonds for the highway," Deal said in the statement. "We are now using the tolls of Georgia 400 drivers to pay for other road projects. That’s not fair to the commuters in north Fulton and Forsyth counties. They’ve carried more than their fair share." Deal’s resolve waned in the coming months. By the time Deal took office in January 2011, the State Road and Tollway Authority Board had already sold $40 million in bonds based on the revenue expected from the newly extended toll. Ending the toll "would be an abrogation of a contract," the governor’s spokesman, Brian Robinson, told PolitiFact Georgia in 2011. Robinson did not return repeated requests for comment on this article. The feud over the Ga. 400 toll became a flash point during the run-up to Tuesday’s unsuccessful referendum on a regional penny-per-dollar sales tax to overhaul metro Atlanta’s traffic-snarled transportation system. Deal backed the tax, which would have expired in 10 years or less. But tax foes said that the Ga. 400 flap was proof that the government couldn’t be trusted with transportation dollars. Polls showed the tax measure flagging in the polls. Twelve days before the election, Deal announced that the state would pay off the $40 million in new bonds by Dec. 1, 2013. The tollbooths would come down soon afterward. "When the Ga. 400 toll went up, the state of Georgia promised commuters that it wasn’t forever," his recent news release said. "If we don’t keep that promise, we lose the faith of the people." Deal’s gambit did little for the transportation tax. More than 60 percent of voters in the Atlanta region rejected it Tuesday, according to the Georgia Secretary of State’s Office. Did Deal really fulfill his promise to commuters on Ga. 400? When Deal promised to bring down the toll, he gave himself a deadline: "before the end of 2011," as a campaign news release stated. This new plan misses the original deadline by a full two years. That means Ga. 400 motorists will still be paying tolls much longer than they were originally promised. Deal failed to meet a date of his own making. But he has come up with a plan to eliminate the tolls, albeit on a deadline not addressed in his original campaign promise. Deal earns a Mostly False on this one.

pomt-14897	"Most Americans are ready to put it [marijuana prohibition] behind us and move on."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2015/nov/08/mason-tvert/clearing-air-over-marijuana-support/	Gallup pollsters took the nation’s pulse on marijuana legalization in October and the findings led supporters of legal pot use to declare victory. "It’s pretty clear which direction our nation is heading on this issue," Mason Tvert, a spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project, said in a news release. "The status quo has shifted. Marijuana prohibition has been a public policy disaster, and most Americans are ready to put it behind us and move on." We started our fact checking with Gallup’s recent report to see if it really does show that a majority of Americans support legalization. Just the title of the report — "In U.S., 58 percent back legal marijuana use" — gave us a pretty clear sign that it does. Just the title of the report — "In U.S., 58 percent back legal marijuana use" — gave us a pretty clear sign that it does. "Americans’ support for legalizing marijuana is the highest Gallup has measured to date, at 58 percent," the report concludes. "Younger generations of Americans," Gallup says, "have been increasingly likely to favor legal use of marijuana as they entered adulthood compared with older generations of Americans when they were the same age decades ago. Now more than seven in 10 of today’s young adults support legalization." The 58 percent figure represents the percentage of 1,015 people who answered "Yes," when they were asked, "Do you think the use of marijuana should be made legal or not?" The percent of Americans who support legalization first hit 58 percent in 2013, dipped to 51 percent in 2014 and rebounded back to 58 percent in 2015, according to Gallup. "Over the past six years, support has vacillated a bit, but averaged 48 percent from 2010 through 2012 and has averaged above majority level, 56 percent, since 2013," says the report. The poll was conducted Oct. 7 to Oct. 11, just before leading Democrats faced off in a presidential nomination debate televised by CNN on Oct. 13. During that exchange, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders expressed their views on marijuana legalization. Clinton laughed, at the debate, when she was reminded that about a year ago she had told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour that she didn’t smoke marijuana when she was young and has no intention of starting now. Clinton said "No" when she was asked if she is ready "to take a position" on legalization. But she said she’s interested in learning more about legalization from states that have approved recreational marijuana use. For his part, Sanders said he would vote for a local Nevada measure that would legalize recreational pot use. He has proposed removing marijuana from the federal government’s list of most dangerous outlawed drugs, according to the Washington Post. The same Gallup report says Democrats and independents are the "most likely" of "political groups" to favor legalization while Republicans and older Americans are least likely to support it. Late last week, Republican Donald Trump, speaking at a rally, said states should be allowed to legalize marijuana if they choose to do so, according to the Post. This was a softer stance on the subject for Trump, who says he doesn’t drink or smoke tobacco. Two of the other leading Republican candidates are holding the line. Republican, Marco Rubio would enforce federal law against states that have legalized marijuana use. And Republican Ben Carson, who is leading in the polls, is a retired neurosurgeon who staunchly opposes legalization. Many studies, he says, show marijuana has a harmful effect on a brain as it develops, which continues into a person’s late twenties. "So why would we even think about it?" he asked. "This should be completely off the table." Our ruling Gallup’s survey has found that a "majority" of Americans support marijuana legalization. It’s been a trend that a few of the candidates for president have reflected in their campaigns. Tvert got it right. The statement is True.

pomt-04848	Sherrod Brown "sent billions of our tax dollars to foreign countries."	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2012/aug/13/josh-mandel/ohio-treasurer-josh-mandel-says-us-sen-sherrod-bro/	Federal spending is a major issue in the U.S. Senate campaign of Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel, the Republican trying to unseat incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown. Mandel says spending is wasteful and unsustainable, and he names Brown as a reason. Among several claims in Mandel's TV ad "Change," which accuses Brown of trying to hide his record, is one that says "Brown sent billions of our tax dollars to foreign countries." PolitiFact Ohio can't say if spending is wasteful, and we don't have a crystal ball to judge if it is sustainable. But we can assess if Brown is "hiding" (as the ad states) that he has sent billions of tax dollars overseas. The ad's claim is spoken by an announcer and appears on screen next to a photo of Brown. In the background is a blended collage of the flags of Panama, China and South Korea. The source cited in the ad for the claim is an article that appeared Sept. 9, 2010 in the Washington Times. The article said the Department of Energy had acknowledged that "as much as 80 percent of some green (energy) programs, including $2.3 billion of manufacturing tax credits, went to foreign firms that employed workers primarily in countries including China, South Korea and Spain, rather than in the United States." The story also referred to a report by American University’s Investigative Reporting Workshop, in February 2010, that more than 79 percent of the first $2.1 billion in stimulus grants to wind energy companies went to foreign firms. The report noted, however, that the grant money was distributed under a program administered by the Energy Department and Treasury, and not by Congress. In some instances, it said, the money went to the American subsidiaries of foreign companies. The Washington Times story goes on to say that the Investigative Reporting Workshop report "raised alarms in Congress. Leading Democrats insisted that the money be spent at home, but restrictions on the funds proved impossible without the specter of a trade war." Brown, who is not mentioned in the Washington Times article, was actually one of the senators who called for the Obama administration to suspend the program indefinitely "until the law can be fixed so that funds only flow to projects that will create jobs in the United States." Co-sponsoring legislation to make that a requirement, Brown said, "Taxpayers expect the government to use their dollars to support American jobs." PolitiFact Ohio looked at the wind project with the Chinese connection earlier this year and found it never got completed. Since companies could only collect money after completion and the program expired last year, it is safe to say that the amount that went to China was "zero," Russ Choma, the reporter who performed the digging at the Investigative Reporting Workshop, told us. Our friends at FactCheck.org, who also examined the Mandel ad's claim, found it to be "highly misleading" and not true. Because the citation in the ad did not support the claim, we asked Mandel's campaign if it had additional sources. "The charge in the ad is also supported by Sen. Brown's votes relative to foreign aid appropriations," spokesman Travis Considine said, citing a story from Politico as "the most recent example of a vote held on the Appropriations Committee Sen. Brown sits on that approved $52.1 billion in foreign aid." He also provided a voting record to show that Brown "has voted for at least $257.9 billion in foreign operations funding since he came to Washington in 1993." The list included votes on omnibus appropriations bills, which cover many areas of spending and often enjoy wide bipartisan support. The $52.1 billion figure in the Politico story refers to the State Department and foreign operations budget. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, that budget funds U.S. diplomatic and foreign aid activities, and "has been the primary legislative vehicle through which Congress reviews the U.S. international affairs budget and influences executive branch foreign policy making in recent years." Included in the budget are the cost of building, staffing and protecting embassies and consular activities; funding for the war-related states of Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, which were exceeded by Israel as the top U.S. foreign aid recipients; foreign economic and security assistance, and contributions to international organizations and missions and multilateral financial institutions. "U.S. national security, trade promotion, and humanitarian interests are rationales for most international affairs activities," the Congressional Research Service said in its report on the budget. The CRS also summed up debate about the budget: "International affairs expenditures typically amount to about 1.5 percent of the total federal budget. While some foreign policy and defense experts view that share as a small price to pay for a robust foreign affairs budget that they believe is essential to meeting national security and foreign policy objectives, others see international affairs spending, particularly foreign aid, as an attractive target for significant spending cuts in order to reduce deficit spending." How much could spending practically be cut? Sen. Tom Coburn, a Republican from Oklahoma, is a fiscal conservative who has been called "the Senate's chief waste-watcher." He released a $9 trillion deficit reduction plan last year that would trim "wasteful, duplicative and low-priority spending" from the Department of State and its foreign operations budget. He estimated the 10-year savings at $192 billion, which still would leave a multi-billion dollar foreign operations budget annually. As for the ad's flags of China, Panama and South Korea, we have previously found Brown to be one of the Senate's most ardent critics of U.S. foreign trade policies. He has voted against trade deals with China, Panama and South Korea -- and Colombia, Central America, Mexico and Canada. Let's bring it home. The ad claims Brown sent billions of dollars to foreign countries. The information that the ad uses to back up that claim, that Brown voted for the stimulus bill, has been proven false. Brown did not make decisions on how that money would be spent, and he was one of the senators who called for its suspension after the foreign grants were reported. When confronted with those facts, the Mandel campaign offered as support for its claim that Brown votes for appropriations for U.S. foreign operations. That's the money for embassies, war-related spending to help establish new governments and the U.S. portions of international missions. That's a ridiculous stretch from what the ad implies, which is that Brown tried to hide that he irresponsibly sent billions or our tax dollars to foreign countries. We have a rating for statements that are both false and ridiculous. It's Pants on Fire.	None	Josh Mandel	None	None	None	2012-08-13T06:00:00	2012-05-23	['None']
pomt-13652	"Interior deportations under Obama were down 40 percent and at a nine-year low."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/05/national-border-patrol-council/interior-deportations-down-9-year-low/	The National Border Patrol Council is speaking out against Hillary Clinton’s immigration plan, arguing it’s dangerous for all American families. The group says her stance on immigration expands policies under President Barack Obama that have created an "era of no consequences." Obama’s policies have decimated border security, the council says. "For seven years, the president’s marketers sold him as the ‘Deporter in Chief.’ There was no truth behind that marketing campaign," the group said in a statement published July 28, coinciding with the last day of the Democratic National Convention. "The truth is that those living in the U.S. illegally were less likely to be deported than under any previous administration. Interior deportations under Obama were down 40 percent and at a nine-year low." The line about interior deportations under Obama sliding 40 percent and reaching nine-year lows piqued our interest. The National Border Patrol Council did not respond to our requests for information on the data behind that statement. Donald Trump’s campaign posted on its website the council’s statement, but they did not respond for comments either. The National Border Patrol Council identifies as the official group representing 16,500 border patrol agents. It endorsed Donald Trump for president in March, saying it was the first time ever it endorsed a presidential candidate in the primaries. ICE immigration removals declining The Department of Homeland Security agencies include U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which handles naturalization and permanent residency applications, among other things. ICE guided us to the agency’s most recent statistical report on immigration removals. ICE says that in fiscal year 2015 (Oct. 1, 2014, to Sept. 30, 2015) the agency began implementing the Obama administration’s "clearer and more refined" civil immigration enforcement priorities, with emphasis on the removal of convicted felons over non-criminals. As a result, there were fewer removals in fiscal 2015 (235,413) than in fiscal 2014 (315,943), ICE said. That’s a single-year decrease of 25.5 percent. ‘Down 40 percent and at a nine-year low’ The National Border Patrol Council’s statement said "interior deportations under Obama were down 40 percent and at a nine-year low." ICE’s fiscal 2015 immigration removals report distinguishes between interior and border removals. Interior removals account for individuals "identified or apprehended in the United States by an ICE officer or agent." These can include apprehensions from jails or elsewhere inside the country, immigration experts say. Border removals, meanwhile, refers to individuals removed by ICE who were "apprehended by a CBP officer or agent while attempting to illicitly enter the United States at or between the ports of entry." ICE says those individuals are also referred to as recent border crossers. These CBP apprehensions at or between ports of entry are then handled by ICE. Interior removals declined about 71 percent from 237,941 in fiscal 2009 (the first year Obama entered office), to 69,478 in fiscal 2015, based on ICE data. And interior removals in fiscal 2015 were the lowest over the eight fiscal years noted in the ICE report. We don’t have data before fiscal year 2008, according to Bipartisan Policy Center, a nonprofit think tank founded by Democratic and Republican senators that has researched the removal data. So it’s difficult to determine if interior deportations are at a 9-year low. But certainly interior deportations have dropped significantly. Immigration policy analysts have told us that interior deportations have decreased under Obama due to the administration’s priority on border apprehensions and on removing undocumented immigrants who pose threats to public safety. Our ruling The National Border Patrol Council said in a statement that "interior deportations under Obama were down 40 percent and at a nine-year low." The group did not return requests for comment, but we found ICE data that references "interior" and "border" removals. Using that data, there isn’t a 40 percent drop -- actually it's about 71 percent. Reports say interior or border removal data wasn’t broken down that way before fiscal 2008, so there isn’t a way to measure the 9-year low, though fiscal 2015 interior removals do represent an 8-year low. We rate the statement Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/261e76c1-148b-4e98-add3-f49d96b51fc3	None	National Border Patrol Council	None	None	None	2016-08-05T15:17:00	2016-07-28	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-09896	On a single-payer health care system.	half flip	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/16/barack-obama/obama-statements-single-payer-have-changed-bit/	President Barack Obama has been prodding Congress to follow his principles on health care reform. He's advocating the same principles he supported during the campaign: Keeping employer-provided insurance in place, making it easier for people to shop for private insurance through a regulated exchange, expanding programs to help low-income people, and requiring large employers to offer insurance or contribute to a health care fund. But at almost every town hall he's held, though — five since March 26, 2009 — Obama has been asked a variation of this question: Why won't you support a single-payer health care system? "It seems to me," said a questioner at one of the town halls, "that we would take that same scenario and increase it outward for the entire country, and that is why I still support single-payer. And I know that at one point you did." We've gotten similar messages from readers pointing us to a YouTube video as evidence that Obama once supported a single-payer plan, which the readers say indicates he has flip-flopped. For those who haven't followed the details of health care reform, a single-payer health care system would mean the government pays hospitals and doctors directly for every person's health care. It's not socialized medicine, like in the United Kingdom, where the government owns the hospitals and doctors are government employees. In essence, it's Medicare, the government-sponsored health care plan for seniors, with no age restrictions. The YouTube video , which isn't the greatest quality, shows Obama speaking in a meeting room to an audience that interrupts him from time to time with applause. A sign on the podium says "AFL-CIO Civil, Human and Women's Rights Conference," and Obama sounds like he's giving a campaign speech: "I happen to be a proponent of a single-payer universal health care program. I see no reason why the United States of America, the wealthiest country in the history of the world, spending 14 percent of its gross national product on health care, cannot provide basic health insurance to everybody. And that's what Jim is talking about when he says everybody in, nobody out. A single-payer health care plan, a universal health care plan. That's what I’d like to see. But as all of you know, we may not get there immediately. Because first we've got to take back the White House, we've got to take back the Senate, and we've got to take back the House." Reports on the Internet date this statement as June 30, 2003. (We'll address the alleged date more in just a bit.) That was a long time ago, but there's no statute of limitations for the Flip-O-Meter. The possibility that Obama may have flipped on the issue is relevant because Obama's conservative opponents sometimes claim that the public option — health insurance run by government that acts as insurer of last resort — is a stalking horse for a single-payer health care system. According to their theory, private insurance will wither in the face of a public option and Obama will get the single-payer system he secretly wants. We reviewed Obama's public remarks and statements, and found no statements that quite match that video. To give you the context, in 2003, Obama was a second-term state senator and beginning a campaign to win the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate. The Democratic field was crowded — there were candidates both better known and better funded than Obama — and he was considered a long-shot at best. He ultimately won, but at the time, nobody was paying much attention to him. In other statements, Obama has spoken favorably of single-payer in concept, but always adding qualifiers. In February 2004, about a month before the primary election in the U.S. Senate race, the Associated Press reported the stance of all the candidates on universal health care. "Obama says he supports the idea of universal health care but does not think a single-payer government system is feasible. He says the government should be the health care provider of last resort for the uninsured." In a rundown of all the candidates' positions, the Associated Press summarized Obama's position as "Support, but 'probably not at this stage,' a single-payer government system." In his book The Audacity of Hope , published in October 2006 when he was a U.S. senator, Obama described single-payer as the hope of the left, while those on the right wanted a market-based approach. "It's time we broke this impasse by acknowledging a few simple truths," Obama wrote, suggesting a system much like the one he supports today. In April 2007, a few months after he declared his candidacy for presidency, the Chicago Tribune reported, "Obama has pledged that, if elected, all Americans would have health-care coverage by the end of his first term. He has said he is reluctant to switch to a 'single-payer' national health insurance system because of the difficulty in making a quick transition from the employer-based private system." At his town halls as president, he routinely answers questions about single-payer by saying he would favor it if he were starting a system "from scratch." But he consistently adds that's not the goal of the current reform. "For us to transition completely from an employer-based system of private insurance to a single-payer system could be hugely disruptive, and my attitude has been that we should be able to find a way to create a uniquely American solution to this problem that controls costs but preserves the innovation that is introduced in part with a free-market system," Obama said in Annandale, Va., on July 1, 2009. But the video strikes a very different tone from the remarks above. To find out more about the video, we tracked down some of the people who worked on health care reform with Obama when he was a state senator in Illinois. Dr. Quentin Young said he has followed Obama's career since Obama first decided to run for state senator in 1995; he lives in Obama's Hyde Park neighborhood in Chicago. A longtime activist in health care matters, Young left his medical practice a few years ago to volunteer full time for Physicians for a National Health Program, a Chicago-based advocacy group for single-payer. The group features Obama as part of its Web site. Young is an ardent supporter for single-payer, he said, because private insurers have an incentive to deprive people of care. "They do what they're supposed to do, which is maximize revenue, so they can pay their investors and their executives. Their profits are breathtaking and obscene" he said. "And you wonder why the health system is so costly." Single-payer makes sense, he said, and Obama used to believe that, too. "It isn't as though this is an import from Europe or Canada. We have had 45 years of experience with Medicare," Young said. Young believes he was in the room when the YouTube video was made, and if he wasn't, it's only because he heard Obama speak often in favor of a single-payer plan during 2003 and earlier, he said. "As I recall, this was his categorical response, that he thinks single-payer is the way to go," Young said. "Over the years, there's been ever more edging on his part, to the point where what he has now is a multitiered program, but it ain't single-payer." Young said the "Jim" Obama refers to in the video is Jim Duffett, director of the Illinois advocacy group Campaign for Better Health Care. It's true, Duffett said, when we contacted him. He's the "Jim" in the video and was at the AFL-CIO speech. He remembered it as having been in December 2003, but it's possible it was in June, he said. Yes, Obama did support single-payer, but Duffett said Obama also talked about the need to be strategic and work within political limitations, which he attributed to Obama's background as a community organizer. "You have to figure out who's with you, who's against you, how you divide and conquer and move that football down the field," Duffett said. "It just can't be the same little group of liberals who have health insurance and sit around the table and verbalize their great policy ideas. You have to have more people than that." Duffett said if the entire video were aired, it would show Obama making statements about the need to be practical, much like his later public statements. "I've never felt that his core principles for accessible, guaranteed health care for everyone were ever compromised. He's an organizer, and you have to figure out as strategically as you can how to win," he said. Duffett urges his supporters to strongly support the public option, the details of which are still in the works. If the public option gets passed and operates well, he said, perhaps it will lead to a single-payer system. "We truly believe a public health option will work to lessen those negative fallacies of what the role of the government can be," he said. Young, on the other hand, calls the public option "wimpy" and part of "a really deceitful set of reforms" pushed by the health care industry to make sure they don't lose any of their profits, even if reform passes. "I don't think they'll even let a watered-down public option go forward. And if it does, they'll use their political clout to weaken it," he said. Both Duffett and Young served on the Adequate Health Care Task Force, a 29-member state board created by the Illinois General Assembly in 2004 to research and recommend a health plan for the state. The legislation that created the board was the Health Care Justice Act, and its chief Senate sponsor was Barack Obama. The chair of the board was Dr. Wayne Lerner, who holds a doctorate in public health policy and a master's degree in hospital administration. Lerner is currently the president of Holy Cross Hospital in Chicago. We asked Lerner if Obama was a single-payer supporter when Obama was a state senator. Lerner said he didn't know what Obama's opinion was on the best health care model, though he definitely felt the task force had the freedom to explore all options. "I never felt constrained one way or the other," Lerner said. "You're not going to find a smoking gun in the act or the task force that there was support for a single-payer system from Obama." Lerner said he, like many others in Illinois, noticed that Obama moved more to the center on several issues during his run for president, and Lerner was pleased by that. "There has to be compromise if we're going to have health care reform," he said. But back to our ruling: Did Obama flip on support of single-payer, as the woman at the town hall implied? The video shows he plainly said, "I happen to be a proponent of a single-payer universal health care program. ... A single-payer health care plan, a universal health care plan. That's what I’d like to see. But as all of you know, we may not get there immediately. Because first we've got to take back the White House, we've got to take back the Senate, and we've got to take back the House." Well, Democrats now have the White House, and the Senate and the House. And Obama still doesn't support a single-payer system. We also have at least one eyewitness — the "Jim" mentioned in the video — who says the 54-second snippet shown on YouTube isn't a full accounting of Obama's more nuanced position. And we have a single-payer supporter, Dr. Quentin Young, who said Obama definitely was for single-payer and switched. So let's put this to the Flip-O-Meter. Opponents of Obama's health plan who watch the video see a stark flip (and possibly hints of what they believe he's wanted all along). Indeed, his comments seem quite clear that he supported a single-payer plan. But a full examination of his comments then and now reveals they have not changed that drastically. Yes, when he was trying to appeal to the Democratic base, he was a bigger supporter of the single-payer plan. But as we note, he still says that he'd prefer such a plan if he was starting from scratch. So what we see here is a candidate who in 2003 was trying to appeal to a liberal electorate and today has moderated his comments to appeal to a broader national audience. That's a Half Flip in our view.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2009-07-16T15:39:01	2009-07-01	['None']
pomt-13413	"My opponent… was on both the city of Chicago payroll and the state of Illinois payroll simultaneously, taking full salary, funding her full pension benefits both as a city worker and as a state worker for 10 years."	half-true	/illinois/statements/2016/sep/22/leslie-geissler-munger/munger-says-mendoza-double-dipped-pension-salary/	As Illinois grapples with more than $111 billion in unfunded pension debt, Republican Comptroller Leslie Geissler Munger has sought to tie her opponent, Chicago City Clerk Susana Mendoza, to the problems that have contributed to the state’s pension crisis. During a Chicago Sun-Times editorial debate on Sept. 15, Munger said: "My opponent… was on both the city of Chicago payroll and the state of Illinois payroll simultaneously, taking full salary, funding her full pension benefits both as a city worker and as a state worker for 10 years." Mendoza fired back, saying the statement was Munger’s "latest false allegation" and one that previously has been disproven. But the Munger campaign since has doubled down on its "double-dipping" claim that Mendoza took two government salaries and paid into two public pension systems, and now is calling on the Chicago Democrat to forgo one of her pensions. With Munger making Mendoza’s pensions and city/state salaries prominent issues in the comptroller race, we wanted to find out if her allegation of double-dipping is true. Mendoza’s pensions In 1998, Mendoza began working for the Chicago Department of Planning and Development as a project coordinator. Two years later, she was elected to the General Assembly, where she served as a member of the Illinois House from 2001-2011, before winning the election for Chicago City Clerk in February 2011. To support Munger’s claim, Phillip Rodriguez, Munger’s campaign manager, provided documents obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests that show Mendoza’s pension contributions into the Municipal Employees’ Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago and the General Assembly Retirement System. According to these records, Mendoza contributed $66,035 into the state pension fund and $34,943 into the city pension fund between 2001 and 2010 -- the time she served as a state representative while also working for the city. As of Aug. 15, 2016, Mendoza’s contributions into the city pension fund totaled $101,736. Mendoza contributed 9.5 percent of her lawmaker salary and 8.5 percent of her city salary, meeting employee contribution requirements for both retirement systems. In 2010, Mendoza’s legislative salary was $67,836 and her base city planner salary was $75,036, or a monthly rate of $6,253. Double dipping? While Mendoza has acknowledged collecting paychecks from both the city and state and paying into the two public pension systems, she has produced documents that challenge the allegation she was double dipping on taxpayer-funded salaries. In a Jan. 8, 2002, memo to the planning department, Mendoza provided her legislative schedule and requested she not be paid by the city of Chicago on days the Illinois House was in session. "As you are aware, it is extremely important that during the days that I am in session, I not be paid by the City as well," Mendoza wrote. "It is of utmost importance to me that my records be perfectly clear regarding this matter." Mendoza listed a total of 44 days between January and May 2002 to reflect her legislative schedule. This 2002 memo is the only such documentation in which Mendoza explicitly asked not to be paid on days when the General Assembly was in session, but her pension contributions into MEABF also show hours were docked over her entire legislative tenure. While it’s difficult to discern from the MEABF document exactly how many hours were docked, it does show deductions in both wage earnings and pension contributions during her entire time in the House. Stacey Ruffolo, a spokesman for MEABF, noted unless requested, employees usually have their hours docked for disciplinary reasons. In defending her pensions during the editorial board debate, Mendoza said her city pension will be less because she wasn’t paid for the days she was in session. Mendoza also said she will fold her two pensions into one as GARS and MEABF are reciprocal retirement systems, though records show she has not yet applied for reciprocity. "I also chose to not take the more lucrative pension that I could have taken when I was elected city clerk; I just went ahead and continued to be in the regular Municipal Employees’ Annuity and Benefit Fund pension instead of the Cadillac plan pension," Mendoza said during the debate. Our ruling Munger said: "My opponent… was on both the city of Chicago payroll and the state of Illinois payroll simultaneously, taking full salary, funding her full pension benefits both as a city worker and as a state worker for 10 years." Although Mendoza did request not to be paid by the city on days the House was in session, records from both GARS and MEABF show she still paid the full required rate for employees into both retirement systems. In addition to the 2002 memo that identifies the days she would be in session, the document from MEABF reflects deductions in earnings, hours and pension contributions, which coincide with the General Assembly’s normal legislative schedule. Munger is correct when she claims Mendoza was on both the state and city payroll, and that she fully funded two different pensions, but she is incorrect in saying Mendoza collected her full salary from the city. Records show a deduction in earnings during her tenure as a state lawmaker. For these reasons, we rate Munger’s claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ee7f0cba-9c86-4fd2-8203-84d28bb4a361	None	Leslie Geissler Munger	None	None	None	2016-09-22T16:20:17	2016-09-15	['Chicago', 'Illinois']
pomt-03957	Says 2012 was the "first year in American history that more minorities are being born than people in the majority."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/feb/17/cory-booker/cory-booker-says-more-minorities-born-2012-racial-/	The growing diversity of America’s melting pot just may have made history, according to Cory Booker. Newark’s mayor described the milestone during a Feb. 1 appearance on the "Bill Maher Overtime" show, where he was a guest panelist. Booker claimed that 2012 was the "first year in American history that more minorities are being born than people in the majority." It’s clear that the United States is a more diverse country than in the past, but Booker’s claim of history being made in 2012 is inaccurate. Let’s first look at data from the U.S. Census Bureau and then the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics. It’s important to note that each agency tracks data differently: the Census Bureau tracks population by race, but not births by race. The National Center for Health Statistics tracks births in whole numbers and percentages, and breaks down those numbers in multiple categories, including race. In May 2012, the Census Bureau confirmed the milestone Booker referenced, but for the year 2011 -- not 2012. "Last year we said (in a news release) 50.4 percent of our nation’s population younger than age 1 were minorities as of July 1, 2011," Census Bureau spokesman Robert Bernstein told us. "This is up from 49.5 percent from the 2010 census taken April 1, 2010. But in the news release we didn’t … look at the period any time before 2010, so we can’t confirm with 100 percent certainty that this is the first time ever so it may very well be true, that statement, but we can’t confirm that based on our written publication." Population and birth data for 2012 from the Census Bureau and the National Center for Health Statistics won’t be available for several months, spokespeople for both agencies said. Next, let’s look at birth data by race for the majority race of non-Hispanic whites and these minority groups: non-Hispanic black, American Indian or Alaska native, Asian or Pacific Islander, and Hispanic. We looked at Vital Statistics Reports birth data going back to 2000 and found that the highest number of minority births – 2,005,890 – occurred in 2007. But that wasn’t more than the number of non-Hispanic whites that year: 2,310,333. After 2007, the four years with the highest number of minority births, in order, occurred in 2008, 2006, 2009 and 2005, according to the data. Births of non-Hispanic whites, however, were still higher than minority births in each of those years. We contacted Booker’s press office three times and asked for the source of his data, and we also shared our findings in an e-mail with his press office. We received no response, other than two e-mails acknowledging our requests for comment. Our ruling Booker claimed on "Bill Maher Overtime" that 2012 was the "first year in American history that more minorities are being born than people in the majority." Since 2000, the highest number of minorities born in the United States was in 2007, at 2,005,890 – but there were 2,310,333 non-Hispanic whites also born that year. After reviewing 11 years worth of data, there was no other year in which the number of minority births was higher than that of the majority, non-Hispanic whites. Looking strictly at population breakdowns by race, the Census Bureau said 2011 was the first time a majority of people in the United States younger than age 1 were minorities. Booker’s claim referenced that milestone, but with the wrong year. The mayor said it happened in 2012, but the Census Bureau said it occurred in 2011. Since Booker’s statistic was partially correct we rate his statement Half True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.

pomt-01274	"We’re above 800 million Muslims radicalized, more than half the Muslims on Earth That’s not a minority. That’s now a majority."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/nov/05/ben-shapiro/shapiro-says-majority-muslims-are-radicals/	The rise of the Islamic State group and its strategic use of grisly beheadings has stirred a heated debate in this country about the nature of Islam. Some critics say core Muslim beliefs invite violence. Defenders of religious tolerance say extremists represent only a tiny minority of Muslims. Conservative pundit Ben Shapiro jumped in to say the nature of Islam is irrelevant. More important, according to Shapiro, is what its followers believe, "because that’s what they act upon." Through this lens, Shapiro painted a disturbing picture of the religious wellspring for people who fly planes into towers and behead their prisoners. Shapiro is an editor-at-large with the conservative website Breitbart.com and cofounded a conservative media analysis group, TruthRevolt. In a video, Shapiro blended survey data and population statistics for 15 countries. A good example of his thesis about Islam is in the way he talked about Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim nation. "It’s got almost 205 million Muslims," Shapiro said. "According to one 2009 poll, it showed almost 50 percent of Indonesians support strict Sharia law, not just in Indonesia but in a lot of countries. And 70 percent blame the United States, Israel or somebody else for 9/11. You make that calculation, it’s about 143 million people who are radicalized. You scared yet? We’re just getting started." To get to 143 million "radicalized" Muslims, Shapiro took the 70 percent of Indonesia’s Muslims who blamed someone other than al-Qaida for the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Shapiro then made similar extrapolations using polling data for a number of other countries, often measuring support for Sharia law -- codes of behavior in Islam. Then Shapiro summed up and applied the percentage of "radicalized Muslims" from the 15 nations to a number of other Muslim-majority countries and, with 1.6 billion Muslims worldwide, reached a shocking conclusion. "We’re above 800 million Muslims radicalized, more than half the Muslims on Earth," Shapiro said. "That’s not a minority. That’s now a majority." Shapiro spoke with great self-assurance, but as we looked at his claim that most Muslims are radicals, we were left scratching our heads. In the first place, Shapiro consistently used the highest percentages available in the surveys to maximize the number of Muslims he could tag with the "radical" label. Secondly, he used a broad definition of radical. To choose one main example, there are many varieties of how people interpret Sharia law and support for it says little about a person’s specific beliefs. Other numbers tell a different story Shapiro cited the work of the Pew Research Center in some of his analysis and much of our work relies on the same source. We tried to reach Shapiro and were unsuccessful. In about half of the countries he assessed, Shapiro focused on support for Sharia law. According to the Council on Foreign Relations, "Sharia guides all aspects of Muslim life, including daily routines, familial and religious obligations, and financial dealings." It is a moral code that covers marriage, crime and business. Different branches of Islam use different versions of the law. Some elements are widely accepted, such as the immorality of fraud. But for countries and sects that follow the harshest versions in which thieves have their hands cut off and unfaithful women are stoned to death, the opposition from the West, and parts of the Muslim world as well, is strong and visceral. For Shapiro, support for any form of Sharia law means one thing -- the believer is a radical. Accordingly, Shapiro looks at a place like Pakistan and says that 76 percent of Muslims want Sharia law in all Muslim countries. Pakistan has 179 million Muslims, therefore, "that is another 135.4 million radicals." But looking at a 2013 Pew report on Muslims, we found that the picture is more complicated. Pew reported that 84 percent of Pakistani Muslims wanted Sharia law, but of those, nearly two-thirds said it should only apply to Muslims. Run those numbers through and you get about 54 million Muslims who think all Pakistanis should be subject to Sharia law. That’s about 60 percent fewer than Shapiro said. We are not saying that Pakistan has 54 million radical Muslims. Our point is that more detailed polling data changes the results a great deal. Shapiro chose one yardstick. Other analysts could with at least as much justification choose another. The impact of which question is used becomes even clearer if we look at support for suicide bombings against civilian targets. Shapiro said actual terrorists draw "moral, financial and religious support from those who are not terrorists themselves." Even if you believe Shapiro, it doesn’t mean that attitudes towards terrorism are irrelevant. Pew asked Muslims if they supported suicide bombings against civilians. In Pakistan, 13 percent of Muslims said such attacks in defense of Islam could often or sometimes be justified. If that’s your definition of radicals, then Pakistan has about 23 million of them. Hardly a small number, but it’s a far cry from the 135 million Shapiro counted. The following table shows how using reasonable alternative measures of radicalism, Shapiro’s majority can become a distinct minority. You can see how Shapiro reached his totals by watching the video. Country Population (millions) Radical total (Shapiro, millions) Alternative pct. Alternative total (millions) Indonesia 205 143 Pew: 7% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 14.4 Egypt 80 55.2 Pew: 29% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 23.2 Pakistan 179 135.4 Pew: 13% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 23.3 Bangladesh 149 121.9 Pew: 26% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 38.7 Nigeria 75.7 53.7 Pew: 22% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 16.7 Iran 74.8 62.1 ICP/Charney: 47% would abolish the morality police. 35.2 Turkey 74.7 23.9 Pew: 15% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 11.2 Morocco 32.4 24.6 Pew: 9% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 2.9 Iraq 31.1 24.3 Pew: 7% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 2.2 Afghanistan 24 24 Pew: 39% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 9.4 Jordan 6.4 3.8 Pew: 15% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 1 Palestinian areas 4.3 3.83 Pew: 40% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 1.7 France 4.7 1.6 No alternate used 1.6 Great Britain 2.8 2.2 Manchester Policy: 2% expressed some support for terrorism. 0.06 United States 2.6 0.5 Pew: In 2009, 8% said suicide bombings could sometimes be justified. 0.2 Total 946.5 680.03 181.76 Percent of total 72% 19% To be clear, we’re not saying there are 181 million radical Muslims. We’re simply saying by applying different but reasonable criteria to the same data, you can reach a vastly different result. Sharia ≠ radical Given that Shapiro used support for Sharia law in 7 of the 15 countries as a marker for radicalism, we should note that the experts we reached urged a more cautious approach. Pew found that when you ask Muslims about specific elements in Sharia law, support shifts. According to James Bell, director of International Survey Research at Pew, many Muslims will say they want religious judges deciding family or property disputes. But ask them about corporal punishments for criminals or the death penalty for apostates, and support drops off considerably. "The key takeaway is that Muslims differ in what they mean by Sharia and how they want it applied," Bell said. Jim Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute, a political and policy advocacy group for Arab Americans, said most Muslims don’t think about every element of sharia. "It indicates a degree of nominal faithfulness," Zogby said. If I say I support the law in the abstract, it doesn’t commit me to supporting various and assorted aspects." In two countries, Shapiro focused on support for honor killings. Zogby said that as cruel as honor killings are, they are not tied to beliefs that underlie beheadings and suicide bombings. "One has nothing to do with the other," Zogby said. Maria Sobolewska, a lecturer in quantitative methods and politics at the University of Manchester, England, studied polls in that country in the wake of the 2005 bus and subway bombings. Sobolewska found enormous variation in Muslim responses depending on small changes in the wording of questions. "What we receive as a true picture of what Muslims think is mostly an artifact of what they get asked," Sobolewska wrote. We should note that we found no solid estimate of the number of radical Muslims worldwide. For example, a 2014 report on jihadist terrorism from the Bipartisan Policy Center did not quantify the size of the jihadist population. Our ruling Shapiro said that a majority of Muslims are radicals. To make his numbers work, he had to cherry-pick certain results from public opinion surveys. Given the choice between two possible percentages, he chose the higher one. Shapiro also relied heavily on the idea that anyone who supported sharia law is a radical. Some of the best polling work shows that Muslim beliefs are much more nuanced. Some countries where high percentages of Muslims support Sharia law show low support for suicide attacks on civilians. Large fractions of Muslims that endorse sharia law do not want it imposed on others. The meaning of Sharia law varies from sect to sect and nation to nation. Shapiro’s definition of radical is so thin as to be practically meaningless and so too are the numbers he brings to bear. We rate the claim False.

pomt-06204	"[Former Georgia congressman] Bob Barr voted ... to raise his own pay."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2011/dec/09/club-growth/group-attacks-barr-voting-record/	Former Georgia congressman Bob Barr -- considered a hard-line conservative in his days on Capitol Hill -- got socked last week with a pre-emptive strike from the right. Four conservative-leaning groups urged Barr, who is thinking about a return to Congress, to butt out of a race against U.S. Rep. Tom Graves, a North Georgia Republican in his first full term in Congress. One of those groups, the Club for Growth, made a claim against Barr that the others didn’t. "Bob Barr’s record has significant flaws," said Club for Growth President Chris Chocola. "Bob Barr voted for No Child Left Behind, to raise the debt limit and to raise his own pay." We were curious about whether Barr, who served four terms in the House of Representatives, voted to raise his own pay. Longtime University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock said it’s not surprising to see such charges as campaigns conduct more intensive opposition research. Bullock found the specific criticism about congressional raises interesting, since the claims are about something that happened about a decade ago. Still, Bullock said it could resonate with some Georgia voters as the state and nation suffer through high unemployment. Bullock speculated some voters may conclude "here’s a guy who is in a position to do more for himself and he does it." Congress gets an automatic cost-of-living increase each year unless it passes legislation stopping the raise the year before it takes effect. The increase is part of the Ethics Reform Act, which became law in 1992. Barr served in Congress from 1995 to 2003. Congress received salary bumps five times during that time, in 1998 and from 2000 through 2003, according to the Congressional Research Service. The increases ranged from 2.3 percent to nearly 3.4 percent. Barr’s salary was $154,700 in his last year in Congress. Members of Congress currently make an annual salary of $174,000. Congress passed legislation to stop the pay increases for the years of 1995, 1996 and 1997, according to the CRS. In September 1997, Barr voted against a bill that would have helped Congress to get a raise. Barr said an increase was "inappropriate at this time," according to a Rome News Tribune account. Later that month, Barr voted against an appropriations bill that had the increase provision intact, The Washington Post reported. The bill still passed. In 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002, Barr voted in favor of "consideration" motions in the House of Representatives that allowed legislation to move forward that included salary increases for Congress, congressional records show. Most members of the Georgia House delegation also voted in favor of those measures, records show. Those members included Republicans such as Johnny Isakson, now U.S. senator from Georgia, John Linder, Charlie Norwood and Nathan Deal, who is now Georgia’s governor. Club for Growth spokesman Barney Keller believes those measures are proof that Barr voted for an increase in his pay. "It’s a motion on the previous question," Keller told us. "He could have voted to prevent the pay raise." We reached out to Barr to talk about the Club for Growth’s claim and received a call back from Bill Crane, a veteran media strategist and political analyst in the area. Crane argued on Barr’s behalf that his vote for a motion should not be construed as support for any increase in pay. The New York Times noted in a July 2000 article that the appropriations bill does not have language specifying congressional cost-of-living increases. The funds are drawn from general reserves. In those final appropriation bills, which included financing for much of the federal government’s operating budget, Barr was the only member of the Georgia delegation who voted against the legislation in each year, congressional records show. Keller maintained his position. "[Barr] knew what it was," he said, referring to the procedural measures. "He could had voted no. He voted yes." And what about Barr’s vote in 1997 against the raise? "That’s typical of a career politician to wave around a shiny object to distract voters from his record," Keller said. "He’s not being honest with Georgia voters." Politicians sometimes defend their votes for some controversial measures by saying they had no choice because it was part of a larger piece of legislation that they were compelled to support. For that reason, it’s often difficult to decipher votes on precise items, especially when it comes to federal spending. Barr did vote in favor of motions that allowed several bills to move forward that gave members of Congress a pay increase. However, these were bills that were part of much larger appropriations bills, and Barr voted against the final version of those bills. The Club for Growth’s claim is technically accurate, but it needs more context that could give readers a full impression of this issue. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-03441	"We have one of the most expensive General Assemblies, per capita, in the entire country."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/jun/23/john-loughlin/john-loughlin-says-rhode-islands-general-assembly-/	Everybody wants lower taxes and one way to get them is to have the government spend less. One suggestion for cutting the Rhode Island budget was made June 7, when Republican John Loughlin, a former state representative from Tiverton and unsuccessful candidate for Congress, was a guest host on WPRO talk radio. "We have one of the most expensive General Assemblies, per capita, in the entire country," he said. "In fact, we're right behind Alaska. And the reason Alaska is so expensive is 'cause those guys have to fly in airplanes to attend General Assembly meetings. But we pay per capita more than the state of New York [and] more than the state of California per capita for their General Assemblies." On the air, he invited PolitiFact Rhode Island to check his assertion that Rhode Island's General Assembly is one of the most expensive and, because it sounded interesting, we gave him a call to ask for his evidence. Loughlin sent us a one-page chart that gave a state-by-state breakdown of legislative expenses and state budgets for the 2010-2011 fiscal year, along with U.S. Census data needed for a per capita calculation. According to that chart, which was developed in March by the National Conference of State Legislatures based on Census data, Rhode Island doesn't just have ONE of the most expensive legislatures. It was the second-most expensive, behind Alaska. While most Americans spent, on average, $9.13 per person on the legislative branch of their state governments, Rhode Islanders spent nearly three times as much -- $26.00 per capita. Alaska ranked first, at $71.27; Pennsylvania was third, at $23.67; Hawaii was fourth, at $22.46; and North Dakota was fifth, at $19.83. New York, which Loughlin also mentioned, was 20th at $11.41 per person and California was 32nd at $8.53 per capita. Connecticut, which ranked seventh, had the second-most expensive legislature in New England. Its per-capita cost was $15.91, 39 percent less than Rhode Island's. The cost in Massachusetts, which has a full time legislature instead of a part-time body like Rhode Island's, was $8.57 per person; the Bay State ranked 31st. Why is Rhode Island's ranking so high? Larry Berman, the spokesman for House Speaker Gordon Fox, said, "When it comes to state legislatures, it is very difficult to make an apples-to-apples comparison because of so many variables." He noted that Montana ranks sixth even though it meets for only 90 days every other year and North Dakota, ranked fifth, meets for no more than 80 days during odd-numbered years. Also, Rhode Island's legislative budget includes some expenses that other states list under other categories, Berman said. In 2011, Berman said, "$4,634,000 of the General Assembly’s budget was earmarked that year for the auditor general’s office . . . [which has] 44 employees [who] work independently of the legislature to evaluate programs throughout state government." Other states don't include audit expenses in the legislative budget, he said. Also, "the budget that year contained $1,298,000 for the operation of our own Capitol Television channel. In other states, the television production may be operated by public television or contained within another part of the state budget," he said. In addition, Berman said the 2011 fiscal year was the year the budget "included $1.5 million for the once-every-10-year function of redistricting. While every state is mandated federally to conduct this process, it does significantly increase our state’s legislative budget for that year only." But when we looked at rankings for the previous five years, when redistricting wasn't done, Rhode Island again ranked second in 2006, 2007 and 2008. It dropped to third place, behind Pennsylvania, in 2009 and 2010. In all six years, per capita costs ranged from $25.01 to $26.78. The expenses cited by Fox's office amounted to about $7.4 million. That's out of a total budget of $27.3 million. Even when we pulled out that money, Rhode Island still ranked near the top, with $19.03 spent by the Assembly for every man, woman and child, putting us in fifth place instead of second. And if you look at what percent of the total state budget goes to the legislature when these expenses are subtracted, instead of 0.43 percent, the ratio dropped to 0.31 percent, putting us in a three-way tie for fourth place. John Simmons, executive director of the business-backed Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council, said because of its smaller size -- only seven other states have fewer people -- Rhode Island doesn't have as many people to share the basic costs of government. "Anytime you're in the top 10 it's a cause for concern, but then when you look at the size of Rhode Island and the economies of scale, most of the smaller-population states are higher ranked" than average, he said. Our ruling John Loughlin said Rhode Island has "one of the most expensive General Assemblies, per capita, in the entire country." The National Conference of State Legislatures has consistently ranked Rhode Island as second or third in the United States. The amount paid to run the legislature -- more than $27 million in the 2011 fiscal year -- translates to $26.00 per resident. Even if you remove more than $7 million in expenses that, according to House Speaker Gordon Fox's office, aren't usually in a legislative budget, Rhode Island's ranking only drops to about fifth. Because that still makes Rhode Island's legislative budget "one of the most expensive," we rate Loughlin's statement as True.

pomt-12426	An "abortion procedure is actually safer than a vasectomy."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2017/may/17/mary-gonzalez/mary-gonzalez-says-abortions-safer-vasectomies/	A Democrat opposed to an abortion-related measure suggested that a snip exclusive to men has proved less safe than an abortion. Rep. Mary González of Clint asked the proposal’s author, Rep. Giovanni Capriglione, in May 2017 floor debate: "First and foremost, did you know that an abortion procedure is actually... safer than a vasectomy?" Capriglione, R-Southlake, replied that he hadn’t researched complications from procedures other than abortion and he also doesn’t believe all outcomes of abortion procedures in Texas are currently reported. His House Bill 2962 requires hospitals to submit reports to the state on abortion complications. Capriglione added: "Not all medical procedures are equally important." Maybe not. Still, are abortions safer than vasectomies? Representative cites Texas figures, Kentucky story A González aide, Andrea Chevalier, said by email the legislator based her abortion-vasectomy safety claim on figures in a Texas Tribune news story and a Kentucky report. The cited June 2016 news story says that according to the Texas Department of State Health Services, fewer than 1 percent of Texas abortions in 2014 resulted in any complication to the woman. The story says the overall number of abortions in Texas had dropped to 54,902 from 63,849 in 2013 in the wake of changes in law, advanced by Republicans, expected to drive down the number of abortions by imposing hospital-level safety standards for clinics and requiring physician-providers to hold admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. Chevalier said that according to a 2006 article by two Kentucky physicians, the incidence of complications such as infection and bleeding from vasectomies can be as high as 15 percent. The article, published in American Family Physician, includes a chart indicating that how a man’s scrotum is penetrated to begin a vasectomy can result in different complication rates. "No-scalpel vasectomy has been shown to reduce the risk of complications (i.e., bleeding and infection) compared with the incision technique," the article says. The chart, citing three studies published from 1990 through 2002, shows varied complication rates of 0.2 percent to 15.9 percent--and also wide variations in the results: SOURCE: Study, "Vasectomy: An Update," American Family Physician, Dec. 15, 2016 (accessed May 15, 2017) We tried to reach the lead author of the update, Tennessee physician Paul Dassow, and didn’t hear back. We turned next to our own research. Abortion complications When we queried DSHS officials about complications due to abortions or vasectomies, spokesman Chris Van Deusen said by email the state doesn’t track fall-out from vasectomies. Van Deusen otherwise pointed us to agency-posted counts indicating that 54,310 Texas residents had abortions in the state in 2015. A separate chart says 52,938 abortion procedures led to no reported complications with 25 procedures resulting in complications, including 10 hemorrhages--which breaks out to a complication rate of less than one-tenth of 1 percent: ^^ Abortions that took place outside of Texas. SOURCE: Chart on web page, "Selected Characteristics of Induced Terminations of Pregnancy, Texas Residence, 2015," Texas Department of State Health Services, last updated March 22, 2017 (accessed May 15, 2017) For national perspective, we emailed Rebecca Wind of the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health and abortion rights nonprofit. Wind answered by pointing out the institute’s January 2017 "fact sheet," which states a first-trimester abortion carries a risk of less than 0.05 percent of "major complications that might need hospital care." A footnote notes a California study, published in 2013, that tallied a total of six major complications after 11,487 abortions. The study said complications of any kind--mostly minor--occurred 1.3 percent of the time. Also to our email inquiry, Barbara Tims of the Texas Medical Association pointed out a 2015 review of 57 studies of abortion complications published from 1980 through April 2015. With few exceptions, the review said, 1 percent or fewer first-trimester abortions resulted in "cervical laceration needing sutures or hemorrhage that required medical management." Also, the report said, physicians who provided antibiotics to women after an abortion said that less than 2 percent of the patients developed infections. The researchers wrote: "Major complications following first-trimester aspiration abortion were very rare. Unanticipated abdominal procedures and hemorrhage requiring transfusion occurred in ≤0.1% of abortions, and the proportion of patients requiring hospitalization to treat major complications was less than <0.5% in most studies reviewed. Vasectomy complications Wind said the institute doesn’t have expertise on vasectomy complications. But she helped us track down a 2005 analysis of available worldwide evidence for a British medical journal that said: "Vasectomy, though safe and relatively simple, requires a high level of expertise to minimize complications." An accompanying chart indicates a 2 percent chance of hematoma, meaning swelling due to blood clotting. "The incidence of hematoma formation," the article states, "seems to correlate with the surgical experience. The hematoma rate was 4.6% for those performing 1–10 vasectomies per year, as against 1.6% for those performing 11–50 vasectomies a year," the article states, footnoting a U.S. study published in 1987. On the high end, the chart shows an average 3.4 percent chance of infection which the article says includes wound, urinary and epididymal infection. Separately, Tims of the TMA pointed out a July 2016 article from the Canadian Urological Association, footnoted to studies from 1984 through 2007, describing varied complication rates from vasectomies. The article states: "Men must be informed about wound care and the potential for early complications: infection (0.2‒1.5%), bleeding or hematoma (4‒20%), and primary surgical failure (0.2‒5%). Men should also be made aware of late complications: chronic scrotal pain (1‒14%) and delayed vasectomy failure (0.05‒1%)." We also queried the American Urological Association; by email, spokesman Brandon Corbett guided us to its "Guideline" for physicians, last amended in 2015, which states: "The rates of surgical complications" from vasectomies "such as symptomatic hematoma and infection are 1-2%. These rates vary with the surgeon's experience and the criteria used to diagnose these conditions." Our ruling González said an "abortion procedure is actually safer than a vasectomy." Both procedures rarely have complications, a clarification missing from this declaration. That said, abortion procedures appear to have lower complication rates. We rate the claim Mostly True.

See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com CORRECTION, 12:00 p.m., May 18, 2017: Our initial post of this fact check overstated the percentage chances of complications from abortions in Texas in 2015.

pomt-07916	"Veterans can now download their electronic medical records with a click of the mouse."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/31/barack-obama/president-obama-says-veterans-can-now-access-their/	State of the Union addresses often seem interminably long. But with so much ground to cover and so many members of the public tuned in -- not to mention intense media scrutiny -- economic use of words is crucial. And so, after interest groups hear what's in the speech for them, they are often left to parse the meaning and import of just a few sentences. There is often a balancing act between brevity and full accuracy. We'll deal with just such a conflict here. In his State of the Union address on Jan. 25, 2011, President Barack Obama boasted that his administration has made "great strides over the last two years in using technology and getting rid of waste." And he used the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs as a prime example. "Veterans can now download their electronic medical records with a click of the mouse," Obama said. Two days later, the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA) posted a response on their website accusing Obama of "mischaracterizing" the VA electronic medical records system. "This is not true," stated IAVA Founder and Executive Director Paul Rieckhoff. "Contrary to the president’s comment, the only thing a veteran can download from the VA’s system are pharmaceutical records and personal health information that he or she has self-entered. This is a critical distinction. "The president’s comments are misleading to service members, veterans and the American public, who now think that this system is in place and functional, while it is clearly not. In the last 24 hours, IAVA has heard from hundreds of members, who have expressed surprise and outrage that the president could get something so wrong in arguably the most important speech of the year." In October, the administration formally launched something called the "VA Blue Button" which allows veterans to download and view some medical information online. Primarily, it allows veterans to access self-entered health metrics such as blood pressure, weight and heart rate as well as emergency contact information, test results, family health history, military health history and other health-related information. Using data from the patient’s Veterans Health Administration’s Electronic Health Records (VistA), it also allows vets to access information about their VA prescription histories, wellness reminders and VA appointments (both past and future). Can a vet get all of his or her medical records via the Blue Button? No. You still can't yet get medical records such as doctors' notes or X-rays. But more and more medical information will become available via the Blue Button over time, said Peter L. Levin, chief technology officer at the Department of Veterans Affairs and the co-creator of the Blue Button. "The things they can download today are generally the kinds of things you'd fill in on a clipboard when you go to see a specialist," Levin said. In March, the VA plans to add information on allergies, he said. And soon, the Blue Button will offer access to lab results, including chemistry and hematology. "We are on a steady path, capturing more and more information from VistA and putting it into MyHealthyVet," Levin said. And vets' requests will drive the information that will be added in the future, he said. "This is actually a monumental VA initiative," said Paul Sullivan, executive director of Veterans for Common Sense. "You have to give the VA some credit." Perhaps, he said, President Obama should have said medical "information" rather than "medical records" are now available to vets online, because the phrase implies things like doctors' notes and medical test results are online. "Maybe he didn't get it exactly right," Sullivan said. "It could come down to word choice. Some of your medical records are online. Some, but not all." Joe Davis, a spokesman for Veterans of Foreign Wars, also praised the VA's Blue Button as a "unique" feature that puts the VA out front on technology. But when Obama said, "Veterans can now download their electronic medical records with a click of the mouse," was he accurate? "Yes, kinda, sorta," Davis said. "They can download a part. 'Some' would have been more accurate. It all depends on your interpretation." Davis also said the VFW hasn't gotten any calls from veterans confused by the president's statement. Probably, he said, most realize that in a State of the Union address, every word takes up time, and so the president used a bit of short-hand. In rating this comment, we weighed the fact that many veterans groups have praised the Blue Button as a major step forward. The medical information now available to veterans is an undeniably valuable technological tool and a praiseworthy advance. But Obama's claim that vets "can now download their electronic medical records with a click of the mouse" suggests much more availability than exists. One could reasonably assume he meant a vet could access all of his or her medical records online. In fact, most of the information now available to vets is information they self-entered. Vets can't yet get a lot of medical records though the Blue Button (though more and more information is being added in the near future). So we rate Obama's comment Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-12011	"Ronald Reagan was a verified Democrat until his mid-50s."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/sep/21/kevin-nicholson/reagan-democrat-50s/	President Ronald W. Reagan is regarded by many as the founder of the modern conservative movement, and experts cite his continuing influence on generations of Republicans. "Without a doubt, he is the most influential American conservative of the 20th and yes, even into the 21st century," said Craig Shirley, a historian and author of four books on Reagan and the first Reagan Scholar at Eureka College (Reagan’s alma mater), where he taught a course titled "Reagan 101." Reagan was elected in 1980 and left office in January of 1989. That means about 38% of the people in the United States were born after Reagan’s time in office ended, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. They and others may not know the finer points in the history of "The Gipper," who was a movie star, president of the Screen Actors Guild and governor of California before ascending to the White House. That led us to take a look at a claim made by U.S. Senate hopeful Kevin Nicholson. Nicholson, a Delafield businessman and U.S. Marine veteran, was the first announced Republican challenger to Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin in the 2018 election. On Sept. 7, 2017, state Sen. Leah Vukmir of Brookfield also entered the GOP race. Nicholson was once president of the College Democrats of America and spoke at the 2000 Democratic National Convention. He referenced his own political conversion -- and that of Reagan -- in an Aug. 6, 2017, interview on "UpFront with Mike Gousha," the WISN-TV public affairs program. "Ronald Reagan was a verified Democrat until his mid-50s, I think, potentially his late 50s," Nicholson told Gousha. "It was the experiences that he saw, the things that he lived, things that he did that ended up making him the most influential conservative voice of modern America because he had seen the other side." Let’s take a look at Nicholson’s claim about when Reagan switched parties. The Reagan library Reagan’s career in the public eye began in 1932, when he graduated from Eureka College and worked as a sports announcer for regional radio. He moved to Hollywood in 1937, where he starred in several films, including "Knute Rockne, All American," "Kings Row" and "Bedtime for Bonzo." He had a long career with the Screen Actors Guild, the labor union for actors, serving as a board member and president in the 1940s and 1950s. During this time, he was an active Democrat, as evidenced by a 1948 radio broadcast of Reagan supporting Democrat Harry Truman for president and Hubert Humphrey for Minnesota senator posted on YouTube. Reagan was born Feb. 6, 1911, making him about 37 years old at the time of the broadcast. An Encyclopedia Britannica biography of Reagan mentions the 1948 radio broadcast on behalf of Democrats, but notes that his politics were gradually growing more conservative. After initially supporting Democratic senatorial candidate Helen Douglas in 1950, he switched his allegiance to Republican Richard Nixon midway through the campaign. Reagan supported Republican Dwight Eisenhower in the presidential elections of 1952 and 1956, and in 1960 he delivered 200 speeches in support of Nixon’s campaign for president against Democrat John F. Kennedy. He officially changed his party registration to Republican in 1962. He would have been 51 at the time. "Reagan became a conservative, though, before he re-registered as a Republican," said Shirley. The foreword of Shirley's book "Reagan Rising, The Decisive Years, 1976-1980" notes the Reagan movement quickly spread, championed by emerging conservative leaders and influential think tanks. It’s worth noting that Nicholson is not the only Democrat-turned-Republican who has cited Reagan’s switch as a basis for his own. In August 2015, Donald Trump discussed Reagan's political history in a TV interview. "It’s sort of easy to explain — now one of the things I always start with -- Ronald Reagan was a Democrat, and he was sort of liberal," Trump said in an interview that aired on Fox News’ "Hannity" program. "And I knew him. I didn’t know him then, quite, but I knew him. And I knew him well. He liked me, I liked him. He was like this great guy. "And he was a Democrat with a liberal bent, and he became a great conservative, in my opinion," he said. "And a great president and a great leader. He had something very special. But if you think of it, he was a little less conservative, actually, than people think." Our rating Nicholson said "Reagan was a verified Democrat until his mid-50s." The 40th president’s past an entertainer, labor union leader and politician is known to historians as well as many Americans of the baby boomer generation. His transition from Democrat to Republican is also well documented, with the formal party switch coming at age 51. (Though experts note he was becoming conservative before that point.)

pomt-00848	"Many of the alarmists on global warming, they’ve got a problem because the science doesn’t back them up. In particular, satellite data demonstrate for the last 17 years, there’s been zero warming."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/mar/20/ted-cruz/ted-cruzs-worlds-fire-not-last-17-years/	The world’s on fire, according to Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas -- but it’s not because of global warming. On Late Night with Seth Meyers March 17, host Meyers brought up an incident that had happened several days earlier -- in which Cruz seemed to frighten a 3-year-old girl when he said "Your world is on fire." (He was talking about foreign policy.) "At first I got excited because I thought maybe you were coming around on global warming, but that’s not the case," Meyers said. "Because I think the world’s on fire -- literally." Cruz responded, "My view actually is simple. Debates on this should follow science and should follow data. Many of the alarmists on global warming, they’ve got a problem because the science doesn’t back them up. In particular, satellite data demonstrate for the last 17 years, there’s been zero warming. None whatsoever. It’s why -- you remember how it used to be called 'global warming' and then magically the theory changed to 'climate change'? The reason is it wasn’t warming, but the computer models still say it is, except the satellites show it’s not." We’ve fact-checked statements like Cruz’s before -- that global warming has stopped over the past 17 years, and that’s reason to be skeptical of accepted science about global warming -- and found the claims lacking. (Here’s the head of a human-caused climate change skepticism organization, as well as Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and environmentalist-turned-skeptic Patrick Moore.) Cruz does have a point: There hasn’t been any significant warming over the past 17 years. However, the scientific mainstream counters that it’s misleading for climate change skeptics to assume this flat trend line will continue indefinitely, or that it negates the long-term likelihood of global warming. Cherry picking NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies tracks global land-ocean temperatures using a temperature index -- that is, how much the temperature deviates from the long-term average: As the chart shows, Earth’s land-ocean temperatures accelerated their increase in the 1970s, setting off a new era of rising sea levels and melting sea ice. Temperatures spiked about 17 years ago in 1998 and have plateaued at similarly high levels ever since. Scientists say it’s worth noting that 1998 was an outlier year that involved a strong El Niño with abnormally warm ocean temperatures. El Nino refers to an occasional pattern in ocean currents that significantly affects the weather globally by releasing heat into the atmosphere. So global temperatures have not changed much since 1998, aside from minor fluctuations. The 14 hottest years on record have all occurred since that peak in 1998, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. By starting his 17-year count with 1998 -- an abnormally hot year because of the El Nino -- Cruz exaggerated the nature of the pause. "Looking at the last 17 years is cherry picking," said Brian Soden, a professor of meteorology and physical oceanography at the University of Miami. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations-affiliated organization that shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize, has specifically addressed claims about the period since 1998. The panel argues that short-term trends are likely a result of natural climate variability and are not representative of the long-term climate outlook. The panel attributes the recent temperature plateau to changes in volcanic and solar activity. Data always fluctuates somewhat, scientists say. "The global average air temperature over the past 150 years has been characterized by overall rise," but superimposed on this general trend are "periods, lasting as much as several decades, of stronger warming, little change and even cooling," said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center and a professor of geography at the University of Colorado-Boulder, told PolitiFact for a previous fact-check. Barring dramatic cuts in carbon emissions, Serreze suggested that 50 years from now, "the period of slower warming from the late 1990s to present will appear as just another blip on the overall pattern of warming." And many scientists fully expect warming to pick up again, though there is less agreement on exactly when that will start. The United Kingdom’s weather office published three reports in which they asserted that temperatures will likely resume their rapid rise soon, though on an uncertain timetable. Climate scientists are still trying to understand the pause, said Rob Jackson, a professor of earth system science at Stanford University. However, he said he would be willing to make a bet with Cruz that "globally, the next 10 years will be warmer than any previous 10-year period since recordkeeping began." Cruz’s response Cruz Spokesman Phil Novack said the senator was not intending to cast doubt on climate change science. He said Cruz recently voted to affirm that climate change is real (though the statement voted on did not attribute those changes to human activity, a key point for climate-change activists who say changes to human activity will be required to keep the environmental impact from worsening). Rather, Novack said, Cruz was trying to emphasize the fact that "the computer models that climate scientists rely on predicted the Earth should be significantly warmer than it is now" based on satellite measurements. What Cruz is casting doubt on is the idea that we should make major policy decisions affecting the livelihoods of millions of people in the name of theoretical conclusions that in fact cannot currently be drawn from science or data," he added. For support, Novack pointed to a blog by physicist Carl Mears, vice president of satellite data company Remote Sensing Systems. In the blog, Mears noted that the company’s satellite-collected data shows that there has been little warming in the past 17 years, and that the observed temperatures were less than what had been predicted by many computer simulations. However, Mears also cautioned that the discrepancy between the model and observation should not be reason to doubt the climate’s sensitivity to human-caused activity. Many factors other than scientific modeling errors, he said, could explain the discrepancy between the models and the observations -- including satellite measurement errors, factors external to the climate (such as volcanic activity), or random climate fluctuations. Jackson of Stanford added that while computer prediction models aren’t always perfect, there are other ways to confirm scientists’ general predictions about the rate of global warming and future climate change. For example, even though the global temperature has stayed relatively stagnant since 1998, this winter saw a record-low of Arctic sea ice, and ocean temperatures are rising rapidly. The fact that the past 17 years since 1998 have been so warm even without a strong El Nino of the sort that occurred in 1998 might in itself be an indication of an overall warming trend and climate change, said John Reilly, co-director of the Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change at the MIT Sloan School of Management. Reilly also cautioned that models are reasonably good at measuring long-term trends, but their ability to predict specific years or decades (such as Cruz’s 17-year time period) is "limited." "The models are unable to capture some of the exact aspects of how the heat accumulation is being allocated between atmosphere and ocean," Reilly said. "But the fundamental idea that greenhouse gases cause the earth to warm is not undermined." "A temporary slowdown does not negate 200 years of climate research," Jackson added. Our ruling Cruz said, "Satellite data demonstrate for the last 17 years, there's been zero warming." Cruz does have a point: There’s been little global temperature change since 1998, and the temperatures measured are lower than what many computer models had predicted. However, focusing on that period essentially means cherry-picking a timeframe that starts at an extremely warm year and ignores that the first decade of the 21st century -- even as it’s been stable -- has been the warmest on record. While scientists don’t deny that there’s been a recent "pause" in warming, they expect it to be a temporary trend. Not only is one anomalous period not enough to undercut longer-term projections, but other types of measurements do show evidence of continued global warming over the past two decades, including rising ocean temperatures and shrinking sea ice. Cruz’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-04682	Under President Barack Obama’s leadership, "since June 2009, (the auto) industry has added a quarter of a million jobs."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/06/bob-king/uaw-president-bob-king-says-auto-industry-has-gain/	One of the big themes of the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., has been a celebration of what President Barack Obama did to help the automobile industry when it was teetering on the edge of financial collapse in early 2009. Bob King -- president of the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, better known as the UAW -- emphasized that point in his speech to the convention on Sept. 5, 2012. "President Obama took action, putting together a rescue team, demanding real change and real sacrifice from everyone involved — from management, from labor, from suppliers, from debt-holders, from dealers, from everybody involved," King said. "It was not universally popular, but it was absolutely right. President Obama's strong leadership saved a million jobs. Since June 2009, this industry has added a quarter of a million jobs, and the auto industry is thriving again. These are good, middle-class jobs in glass, in plastics and steel—jobs making things for an economy built to last." With Detroit’s comeback such a big topic at the convention, we thought it was worth checking to see if that was accurate. We turned to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official source of employment data. There are two categories relevant to this analysis. One is "motor vehicles and parts manufacturing." Since June 2009, seasonally adjusted employment in this sector has increased by 165,100 jobs. The second category is "motor vehicle and parts dealers." Over the same period, employment in that sector increased by 84,500. Add these two figures together and you get 249,600 jobs -- almost exactly a quarter million. With statements such as these, PolitiFact considers not just whether the statement is statistically accurate, but also whether the politician or party in question deserves the credit or blame attributed to it. In this case, determining Obama’s precise role in aiding the auto industry is more a matter of opinion than fact, but experts have told us for other articles that Obama’s leadership was crucial, along with help from some Republicans. So we think it’s reasonable to credit Obama’s "strong leadership" with a role in producing these numbers. Our ruling The data will change once new jobs figures are released on Sept. 7, 2012. But at the time King made the statement, his data was correct. We rate his statement True.	None	Bob King	None	None	None	2012-09-06T17:25:58	2012-09-05	['None']
pomt-11096	"Canada charges the U.S. a 270% tariff on Dairy Products! They didn’t tell you that, did they? Not fair to our farmers!"	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jun/13/donald-trump/fact-checking-donald-trumps-tweets-about-canadas-2/	In the run-up to a stormy meeting of the G-7 group of advanced industrial nations, President Donald Trump zeroed in on a specific trade policy by the meeting’s host, Canada. In fact, he tweeted about it four times over four days, culminating in a rant about "fool trade." The target: Canadian trade barriers on imported milk. On June 8, Trump tweeted, "Canada charges the U.S. a 270% tariff on Dairy Products! They didn’t tell you that, did they? Not fair to our farmers!" (Here are the three other tweets.) See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com He has a point, though he’s left out some important context. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Canada’s sizable dairy tariffs For decades, Canada has protected its dairy industry, erecting trade barriers that diminish foreign competition and result in higher prices for Canadian consumers. While this has prompted longstanding complaints by the United States and other exporters, the tariffs have survived, thanks in part to a strong dairy lobby that Canadian politicians have been loath to oppose. After a small fixed quota of U.S. exports is reached, Canada imposes a tariff on any dairy products brought into the country, with the level varying a bit depending on the specific product. For instance, fluid milk is 241 percent, cheese is 245.5 percent, ice cream is 277 percent, cream is 292.5 percent, and butter is 298.5 percent. Experts said Trump’s tweet is a reasonable mid-range estimate, and given the scale of these tariffs, "Trump's complaints have some basis in fact," said Munroe Eagles, director of Canadian studies at the State University of New York-Buffalo. Not that this is news, said Dan Trefler, a professor at the University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management. "Has the tariff risen over time or otherwise become more restrictive over the last few decades? No," Trefler said. Reasons the United States’ angst may be overstated First, not all the news has been grim for the United States on the Canadian dairy front. In recent years, United States dairy producers have used technological advances to exploit a lucrative loophole in Canadian trade law. They have begun separating milk into its component parts, creating what’s called "ultrafiltered milk." These are high in protein and are easier to use for making cheese and yogurt. Since this product didn’t exist when the most recent negotiations were completed, it falls outside the list of products with high tariffs. So in recent years, U.S. producers have sold a substantial amount of ultrafiltered milk to Canada, duty free. Canada ranks as the second-biggest market for U.S. dairy exports after Mexico. Between 2013 and 2016, United States exports of "milk protein substances" to Canada grew from $78 million in Canadian dollars to $129 million. The United States accounted for two-thirds of all of Canada’s imports of this type. Thanks to these exports, the United States has actually posted a large trade surplus with Canada in dairy products in recent years. In 2016, the United States exported $631.6 million in dairy products to Canada, compared to just $113 million in Canadian dairy exports to the United States (these figures are in U.S. dollars). Part of the reason for low levels of Canadian dairy exports is that the World Trade Organization ruled that Canada is effectively subsidizing its dairy producers, making exports harder. This trade surplus for the United States "has certainly helped balance whatever pain Canada's overall dairy exemptions may have caused," Eagles said. Despite the complaints, the United States has long accepted Canada’s high dairy tariffs as the price of wider access to the Canadian market. The U.S. has similarly protected certain goods that it produces for export. "In the last multilateral negotiations, Canada agreed to set its tariffs on dairy and poultry at high, but agreed, levels, as did the U.S. on products such as peanuts, tobacco, and sugar," said Michael Hart, a trade policy specialist at Carleton University in Canada. "As good as these agreements are, the level of protection on some agriculture products remains obscene, but legal. If Trump wants to lower them, he needs to negotiate." A recent change in Canadian policy That said, Canadian dairy interests have fought back with a policy that promotes using domestic sources of milk for high-protein substances. In 2017, U.S. exports of milk protein substances to Canada fell by about half. The change of Canadian policy on ultrafiltered milk "is a legitimate concern for U.S. dairy exporters," said Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Ultimately, neither side has entirely clean hands on this issue. "Given the domestic political concerns and the power of agricultural lobbies in Canada and the U.S., there's no such thing as pure-as-snow free trade in agriculture," said Ross Burkhart, a political scientist specializing in U.S.-Canada relations at Boise State University. "Each country can point to the other's protection if they wish." Our rulings Trump tweeted, "Canada charges the U.S. a 270% tariff on Dairy Products! They didn’t tell you that, did they? Not fair to our farmers!" That number is a reasonable estimate of Canada’s dairy tariffs, which are high by any standard. That said, the United States has recently run a sizable trade surplus with Canada in dairy products, driven by a strong business in a milk product that was unaffected by the high tariffs. Trump also glosses over the fact that the United States imposes its own trade barriers on certain American-made products. The statement is basically accurate but needs clarification, so we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-05771	"Since President Obama took full control of Washington … every single day, more than 1,500 of our jobs have been lost."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/feb/28/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-ad-says-1500-jobs-lost-daily-barack-obama-too/	A recent ad by the National Republican Congressional Committee -- the House Republicans’ campaign arm -- offers a flurry of statistics to argue that President Barack Obama doesn’t deserve a second term. "What's become of America since President Obama took full control of Washington?" the narrator says. "A wrecked economy, with debt and waste beyond imagination. Since then, gas prices have gone up more than 82 percent. Every single day, more than 1,500 of our jobs have been lost. Every day, another 2,700 of us realize it's been six months since we last had a job. Every day, more than 6,000 of us have begun living below poverty, while 13,000 more have been put on food stamps, and more than 800 have become uninsured. … This is the legacy President Obama and his Democrats have left for us. If we give them more time, what else will they do to America?" There’s a lot to digest here, but we’re going to look at two claims from the ad. The one we’re looking at in this item is, "Since President Obama took full control of Washington … every single day, more than 1,500 of our jobs have been lost." As we do with claims like this, we split our analysis into two parts. Are the numbers right? And is it fair to assess either credit or blame for those numbers to the target of the ad? First, the numbers. We turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official source for employment figures. We first looked at total, nonfarm employment between January 2009, when Obama was sworn in, until December 2011, the most recent month available at the time the ad was released. We also used the figure that would have been available at the time the ad was released. Often BLS adjusts numbers upwards or downwards in the succeeding month, based on additional information. Using the preliminary numbers, a net 1,661,000 jobs were lost nationwide. Assuming that three years means 1,095 days -- or 365 times 3 -- then 1,517 net jobs were lost per day during that period. So, using that measurement, the ad is correct. (Using the revised numbers released after the ad came out, the daily number dropped significantly -- to 1,274 -- due to stronger-than-expected job growth.) But that’s if you start the count in January 2009. Since Obama was sworn in on Jan. 20, 2009, February was actually his first full month in office -- and using the February numbers makes a big difference. Starting with February 2009, the net number of jobs lost was 937,000, which produces a daily job loss of 856, or 43 percent lower than the amount claimed in the ad. (If you look only at private-sector jobs, the daily job loss was even smaller -- 303 jobs, a number that shrunk to just 74 once revised figures appeared.) The difference between starting in January or February is so big because the transition between President George W. Bush and Obama included months with some of the most rapid job losses of the entire recession, which began in December 2007. In just the one month from January 2009 to February 2009, for instance, the economy lost a net 725,000 jobs. Even spread over three years, adding just that one extra month to the calculation means adding 660 additional job losses per day. Next, does Obama deserve the blame? We’ve consistently ruled in the past that the economy is too complex to assign full blame (or credit) for job gains or losses to a president or a governor. "Presidents, governors, and mayors can have an impact on job creation during their terms in office. Almost always, however, the impact is small in relation to the effects of events and trends over which elected officials have little control, especially in their first few years on the job," said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. "A recession that is under way or begins soon after a president or governor takes office is in no way the fault of the new officeholder. The flip side is that chief executives cannot claim much credit for a strong economic recovery that begins shortly before or after they take the oath of office." Of special note here is that this ad uses the formulation, "since President Obama took full control of Washington." Obama -- or at least the Democrats -- can be said to have had full control of Washington, at least on a nominal basis, for two of those three years. But after the Republicans took over the House beginning in January 2011, they have had a share of the control as well. And we can rule out the possibility that the numbers were calculated based on just the two years when Obama had an entirely Democratic Congress, since the NRCC web page linking to the ad states, "This video shows the daily economic pain endured by American workers and families due to President Obama and Washington Democrats' failed policies averaged over every day of the last three years." Our ruling Using the numbers available at the time -- which subsequently have been revised to be more favorable to the president -- and starting the count in January 2009, the ad is correct about the 1,500 jobs lost per day. But starting the count with Obama’s first full month in office, which we think is an equally plausible way of doing it, reduces that number significantly, to 43 percent lower than what the ad claims. Meanwhile, economists tell us that the causes of these job losses are multiple, so it is also incorrect to attribute the blame solely to Obama. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False.

But it happened recently with regard to funding for school safety — and neither Trump nor Pelosi was accurate. In remarks to the National Rifle Association on May 4, Trump said, "I recently signed legislation that includes more than $2 billion to improve school safety, including the funding for training, and metal detectors, and security and mental health." Two weeks later, Vice President Mike Pence repeated that $2 billion figure in a speech in Indianapolis. Our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker awarded these comments Four Pinocchios, their worst rating. Pelosi, however, used much the same logic during a CNN town hall on May 23. She touted new funding for school security, using a somewhat smaller figure of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion. Here’s the exchange with host Chris Cuomo: Cuomo: "The building we're in now, the building that you work in, the point of entry there is secure. You don't walk in with a trench coat with a shotgun underneath your jacket and get in. It doesn't happen. You know this. Why can't that be part of the equation? Talk about universal background checks, fine. Talk about mental health, how to identify them. The money for treatment. But why either/or? Why not make the schools safer? I know it's a state issue, but they're going to ask for money…" Pelosi: "It is a state issue." Cuomo: "And that's where the federal government comes in. … You could offer them money to make schools so that when you go there as a guest, and you walk in, of course, they'll have multiple points of egress for emergencies. But you're going to be looked at when you go in that school and you're not going to walk in with a gun under your coat." Pelosi: "In our omnibus bill that we passed just a few weeks ago, we had $1.8 billion — I think it was $1.8 billion, it could be $1.6 billion — in there for this purpose, for schools to make — to give them an opportunity to secure them. And those schools have to make those decisions." So, did a recent spending bill include at least $1.6 billion for school security or safety? No. When we checked with Pelosi’s office, they said she was referring to the Student Support and Academic Enrichment grants program, known as SSAE for short. This program, run by the Education Department, has been authorized to spend up to $1.6 billion. However, both the dollar figure and the nature of the grants don’t hold up to scrutiny. First, while the program has been authorized to spend up to $1.6 billion, the most recent spending bill only provided a portion of that amount, $1.1 billion. Pelosi "misspoke on the specific amount," said spokesman Drew Hammill. What does the program do? It’s important to remember that Cuomo’s question focused on what could be done to boost security against armed school attacks. The SSAE program, it turns out, isn’t geared exclusively toward school security. Rather, it’s focused broadly on providing "all students with access to a well-rounded education," improving "school conditions for student learning," and improving "the use of technology in order to improve the academic achievement and digital literacy of all students." School violence is one of the specific areas cited in the law. The grants may also be used for improving school-based mental health services, which can ease the causes of some school-violence incidents. However, these are just two of the areas these grants can be used for. Some of the others are: • Technologies such as software, simulations, online databases, computer-based assessments, and educational access tools for rural areas. • The prevention, early intervention, rehabilitation referral, recovery support services, or education related to the illegal use of drugs. • Schools, or dedicated programs within schools, to engage students in "rigorous, relevant, and integrated learning experiences focused on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), including computer science." The explanation of the spending bill published in the Congressional Record on March 28 emphasized that SSAE grants "can be utilized for a wide range of uses." While the uses mentioned in the explanation included "school-based violence prevention strategies," the explanation emphasized that the bill "encourages the department to especially support pre-kindergarten through grade 12 computer science education programs that address the enrollment and achievement gap for underrepresented students such as minorities, girls, and youth from families living at or below the poverty line." And a House committee report describing the bill highlighted that "programs designed to support non-cognitive factors such as critical thinking skills, social skills, work ethic, problem solving, and community responsibility are an eligible use of funds under SSAE grants supporting a well-rounded education." So the $1.1 billion in the spending bill won’t necessarily be spent on school security of the type Cuomo was asking about. Ultimately, "school safety has to compete with STEM, foreign language learning, technology enhancements and numerous other educational priorities for those SSAE funds," said Bob Farrace, the director of public affairs for the National Association of Secondary School Principals. "With that single funding pool, school leaders have to balance the need to safeguard the school with the need to make the school a place worth coming to." What counts as school safety? Pelosi’s spokesman, Hammill, emphasized that protecting students from attacks is about more than just hardening infrastructure. The grants, he said, promote " ‘soft’ efforts to ensure schools can combat bullying, harassment, while offering school personnel training, mental health resources, comprehensive school mental and behavioral health services, drug and violence prevention, training on trauma-informed practices, and health and physical education." While those areas are covered as acceptable uses, the expressed desire by Congress is that these grants also foster such goals as boosting STEM education, digital learning and distance education — and that suggests that not all $1.1 billion will be used on efforts that address school violence, even indirectly. Our ruling Responding to a question about preventing gun violence in schools, Pelosi said that a recent spending bill had at least "$1.6 billion in there ... for schools to give them an opportunity to secure them." Her office acknowledged to PolitiFact that she should have said $1.1 billion, the amount devoted to a federal grant program for schools that was funded in the bill. Still, even that figure is likely exaggerated. When the Education Department distributes $1.1 billion in grants under the program she was referencing, school security will have to fight for that money against such items as STEM education and digital education.

pomt-11028	"There are a lot of private charters. And in fact, (Tony Evers) sought and received the largest charter school grant in the country from the Trump-DeVos administration to start new charter schools in Wisconsin."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/jul/03/kelda-helen-roys/did-wisconsins-schools-chief-receive-largest-chart/	"We need to fully fund and support our schools. Public schools," said Kelda Roys, one of the many Democrats hoping to take on Republican Gov. Scott Walker in the November 2018 election. The comment came during a May 28, 2018 interview with Kai Brito on the WORT 8 O’Clock Buzz. In it, Roys took a jab at rival Democratic candidate Tony Evers regarding some of the charter-school initiatives he has pursued as state superintendent of public instruction. Brito brought up U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos before asking Roys’ stance on education policy. DeVos, a controversial appointee of President Donald Trump, is an outspoken proponent of education reform through school choice and charter school programs. Her critics are quick to point out her absence of experience working in, or even sending her children to, public schools which educate 90% of children in America. Roys’ attack on Evers came in a statement that was a bit of a jumble, but emphasized her criticism of public money being taken away from public schools: "And, you know, frankly, the voucher schools that have proliferated in places like Milwaukee and Racine — and now we’ve got statewide voucher expansion — are a problem, but we also have to address charter schools because there are a lot of private charters. And in fact, our current superintendent of public instruction sought and received the largest charter school grant in the country from the Trump-DeVos administration to start new charter schools in Wisconsin. "And I think that we need to stop privatization because that money comes right off the top and it’s only what’s left over after the charters have gotten their money that goes to our public schools. That’s wrong." Roys brought up a laundry-list of education issues in her statement. So before we go on, it’s worth defining a few terms. Voucher schools Voucher schools are private schools. Most are faith-based. The voucher school program, or "school choice," uses public funds to pay the tuition of a student at a private school. More than 36,000 students across Wisconsin attended private schools through the voucher program in the 2017-18 school year. Charter schools Charter schools, on the other hand, are public schools. Every charter school is entirely publicly funded, open to any student, and free for any student. In the 2017-18 school year, Wisconsin charter schools served more than 42,000 students. There are two main types of charter schools in Wisconsin. Of the 234 charters currently operating across the state, 211 are run within existing public school districts. That includes Milwaukee Public Schools, which oversees 21 charter schools. The other 23 -- all in the greater Milwaukee area -- are "independent" charters, which operate with the most autonomy because they do not answer to a school district and do not employ unionized teachers. These schools are authorized by other public entities: the City of Milwaukee, the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, or the University of Wisconsin-Parkside. The schools are operated by nonprofit companies that have a charter, or contract, with the Milwaukee Common Council or one of the two universities. The agreement offers charter schools some flexibility from state rules governing traditional public schools in exchange for meeting performance targets specified in the contract. "Private charters?" The phrase "private charters" is technically incorrect since all charter schools are public schools. But it is sometimes used -- particularly by critics -- as shorthand to refer to the independent charters run by non-profit groups. Proponents of public schools often talk about "privatization" to refer to any public funds given to schools outside of traditional districts. So, did Evers seek and receive the largest federal grant for charter schools and can some of that money go to "private" charter schools? The charter school grant In 2017, the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction won a $95 million grant from the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Innovation and Improvement. Tom McCarthy, communications director for the state Department of Public Instruction (DPI), told us in an email that since winning its first grant in 1997, the state has won five of these charter school grants. The new grant, part of the Expanding Opportunities Through Quality Charter Schools Program, was the largest awarded in 2017. It is the fourth largest in the last decade of the program’s history, following California ($254 million in 2010), New York ($113 million in 2011), and Florida ($104 million in 2011). Wisconsin submitted the grant application on May 15, 2017 — three months after DeVos assumed her position — and the award was announced in the fall. Because 2018 grants have not yet been awarded, this confirms that this is indeed the "largest charter school grant in the country from the Trump-DeVos administration." Evers, as state superintendent of public instruction and the leader of the DPI, is certainly responsible for this grant -- though McCarthy said that Evers’ "blessing" was about the extent of his involvement in the initiative. Does the grant increase ‘private’ charters? In a June 25, 2018 email Roys spokesman Brian Evans said: "The question becomes, will this grant increase the number of independent charters? To which the answer is certainly yes. In the $95 million grant Kelda was referring to, nothing specifies that this grant money is for public instrumentality charter schools rather than the more private independent charters. In fact, on page 33 of the PDF of DPI's application for the grant, DPI touts recent changes to Wisconsin laws that ‘expanded the reach of independent charter schools and expanded access to these schools across the state.’ They go on to state that ‘the number of independent charter schools will likely increase during this grant period.’ As we previously established, the use of this grant to increase or expand independent charters will very clearly result in an increase in privatization, even if some public charters are also created." Well, only public charters will be created, since all charters are public. But yes, some independent charters will be created under the new grant. Awards from the new grant were announced June 28, 2018, after Roy’s statement. Of the $17.4 million awarded for the first year of the grant, about $4 million will go toward six new independent charter schools. The rest will go to 20 new or existing school district charters. "Over the life cycle of all grants dating back to 1997," added McCarthy from DPI, "the vast majority of the money has gone to schools managed by public school districts." Will the grant result in money losses to public schools? Technically, no. Since charter schools are public schools, an increase in charters -- and any subsequent increase in students who choose to attend them over traditional public schools -- does not change the amount of total public school funding. However, school-level funding follows the students. To fund most of the independent charters (called "2R", a reference to their section in the Wisconsin charter school law), a little bit of funding is trimmed from every public school district across the state. For instance, during the 2017-18 school year, general state aid was reduced by about 1.4% to fund the $65.9 million needed to pay for students to attend these schools. Three of the upcoming independent charters (called "2X") that have been funded by the new grant will instead pull a per-pupil amount from the local school district that the students would otherwise attend. For in-district charters -- which comprise the majority of charters in the state -- school-level funding isn’t an issue. In-district charters are often housed in the same building as the traditional school, their staff are hired under contract from the school district, and in general moving funds from "traditional" to "charter" doesn’t affect resources for the students. Our rating Criticizing "privatization" of the public school system, Roys said Evers sought and received the largest federal grant for charter schools. The grant is the largest awarded under Trump, though it’s one of several received by the state since 1997. Although private entities (non-profits) -- if authorized -- can apply for the grant money and use it to run charter schools, technically, all charter schools are public schools.

pomt-07360	The study that states that more than 70 percent of the traffic on the Sellwood Bridge is to/from Clackamas County has been thoroughly debunked by The Oregonian.	false	/oregon/statements/2011/may/07/john-lee/did-oregonian-debunk-10-year-old-study-sellwood-br/	PolitiFact Oregon loves to see The Oregonian cited in arguments for and against ballot measures. It makes us feel useful. So we were initially pleased to read in the arguments against a new vehicle registration fee for the Sellwood Bridge this comment from Clackamas County GOP Chairman John Lee: "The study that states that >70% of the traffic on the bridge is to/from Clackamas is over 10 years old and has been thoroughly debunked by the Oregonian." Measure 3-372, for those who don’t follow Clackamas County news, would increase the state’s motor vehicle registration by $5 a year for county residents. The money, about $22 million, would go toward replacing the dilapidated Sellwood Bridge that is in neighboring Multnomah County but used by Clackamas County residents. Just how much of the bridge is used by those residents has played a central role in the campaign. Proponents like to cite Metro’s May 1999 South Willamette River Crossing Study,which shows that about 70 percentof the 30,000 trips across the bridge each day originate or end inClackamas County. Opponents of the measure argue that the study is dated and in fact says no such thing. This is where PolitiFact Oregon comes in. First, we dug up the study and on page 5 we found the relevant pie chart. The pie shows that 50 percent of trips over the bridge are between Clackamas County and Portland; 13 percent of trips are between Clackamas and Washington counties; and 7 percent of trips are between east and west Clackamas County. That adds up to 70 percent of trips either end or begin in Clackamas County. But wait, here’s the rest of the pie: 17 percent of trips are between the east and west sides of Portland, and 13 percent of trips are between Portland and Washington County. So the pie chart also states that 80 percent of the trips end or begin in Portland. Both percentages were included in a Feb. 16 story by Yuxing Zheng, The Oregonian’s Clackamas County reporter. So it turns out she added some context from the study -- but it’s a pretty far stretch to say that The Oregonian "debunked" anything. "We have not debunked it at all," she said, "because it is factually correct." Now we acknowledge that the 1999 study is old, with traffic figures based on 1994 travel. So we poked around for newer figures and found this: a 2006 semi-update of the 1999 study with 2030 traffic projections. This version projected 76 percent of trips starting or ending in Clackamas County, with 9 percent of trips solely within the county. Trips ending or starting in Multnomah County would account for 79 percent of trips. (This totals more that 100 percent because trips can begin or end in either county.) We talked to Lee about this, and were rather impressed with his candor in a follow-up email. "My statement that the Oregonian "debunked" the study rather than the >70% Clackamas traffic may have been worded better," he wrote, adding that he was really bristling at previous media reports that characterized Clackamas County residents as making 70 percent of bridge trips, which is not completely accurate. For example, The Oregonian published an editorial and a news story in February 2010 about a Portland City Club report, which inaccurately stated that Clackamas County drivers would account for three times the number of trips across the Sellwood Bridge as Multnomah County drivers. The Oregonian corrected that figure in a March story when City Club issued a correction; the March story also stated that 79 percent of traffic would start or end in Multnomah County, and 76 percent would start or end in Clackamas County. "The impression given to voters has been that Clackamas residents use the Sellwood bridge MUCH more than anyone else so they should pay for it to be replaced," Lee wrote. We feel for the GOP county chairman. It’s frustrating when statistics are short-handed to the point of being inaccurate. But we have to object to his claim that The Oregonian debunked a study that claimed "more than 70 percent of trips ends or starts in Clackamas County." The March 2010 story simply corrected one figure -- which was retracted by City Club itself -- and added context. We rate the statement False. Comment on this item.

pomt-06569	Says U.S. Sen Sherrod Brown "promised that the first stimulus bill would fund the Brent Spence Bridge."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2011/sep/30/josh-mandel/josh-mandel-says-sherrod-brown-promised-ohio-river/	Everyone, it seems, wants to sell you a bridge. Don’t buy their promises. One particular bridge spanning the Ohio River comes with a claim of a broken promise that Josh Mandel’s camp is pressing as an election issue. "Sherrod Brown promised that the first stimulus bill would fund the Brent Spence Bridge … and now he is embarrassed to stand there with the president after both of them broke their promise," Mandel’s campaign said in a news release. Mandel, currently Ohio’s treasurer, is a Republican who wants to oust Brown, a Democrat, from his U.S. Senate seat in the 2012 election. The news release, distributed Sept. 28,2011, by Mandel campaign spokesman Joe Aquilino, criticized Brown on several fronts. The reference to the Brent Spence Bridge, which carries traffic for Interstates 71 and 75 across the Ohio River, refers both the federal stimulus package Congress approved two years ago and to a recent visit President Barack Obama made to promote a second stimulus bill. Brown was not present, saying he had congressional business to attend to in Washington. Before Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, better known simply as the stimulus act, lawmakers across the country were discussing whether the federal government should funnel billions of dollars into bridge, road and sewer projects. Brown believed so, saying that by funding "shovel-ready projects," the government could begin filling the country’s extensive infrastructure needs while putting Americans back to work. Among Browns comments then was one that referred to the Brent Spence Bridge. Transportation planners say the 48-year-old bridge needs to be replaced. It is cramped, has poor visibility and carries more than twice the 80,000 vehicles a day it was designed for, according to the Cincinnati Enquirer. But coming up with the estimated $2.4 billion is a problem that has has dogged local and state governments in Ohio and Kentucky. Enter Brown. In an appearance on MSNBC’s "Morning Joe" program on Jan. 28, 2009, Brown said that "we do need to do direct spending on job creation. That means shovel-ready projects for water and sewer systems, whether it's the Brent Spence Bridge in Cincinnati that will put a lot of people to work and help with economic development, or whether it's a water and sewer system in Defiance, Ohio or in Nashville. It's pretty clear to me that we need direct spending on projects that are ready to go, particularly, green projects that put people to work immediately but also help longer term and economic development." Did you hear a promise in there? Mandel did. It is beyond question that Brown cited the Brent Spence Bridge in 2009 as an example of a project the first stimulus bill could fund, just as Obama used it as an example recently. Obama went further than Brown, using his speech to also send a message to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and House Speaker John Boehner of southwest Ohio. "Mr. Boehner, Mr. McConnell, help us rebuild this bridge," Obama said, standing in the bridge’s shadow on Sept. 22. It is also beyond question that this is not a shovel-ready project. Had PolitiFact Ohio been around then, Brown’s inclusion of the Brent Spence Bridge as a shovel-ready project might have rated False on the Truth-O-Meter. While there have been preliminary studies, more extensive engineering and planning are required. The Cincinnati Enquirer reported recently that "in a best case scenario, the earliest that workers would be hired would be in 2013, but more likely 2015." Facing questions about the bridge, a White House spokesman stressed the same day as Obama’s speech that the Brent Spence project is merely "an example" of the kind of project that could get funding in Obama’s new $447 billion stimulus proposal. Many details remain to be worked out, including how a particular component, a $10 billion infrastructure bank, would work. It is not clear whether this -- or a bigger infrastructure bank that Brown proposes -- could be used toward the eventual Brent Spence project. So let’s stipulate: Brown said in 2009 that the Brent Spence Bridge was the kind of project the first stimulus could pay for, using it as an example of a shovel-ready project. He clearly suggested that the bridge could be built with stimulus money. It didn’t happen. And the project was not shovel-ready. Does this make it a broken promise? PolitiFact Ohio discussed this with the National Republican Senatorial Committee, whose spokesman, Jahan Wilcox, says that Brown certainly made a strong suggestion that a casual listener might equate to a promise. We agree. That’s an element of truth that that factors into why we are not ruling Mandel’s claim about a broken promise to be entirely False. But Mandel used a strong word: promise. He did not say Brown broke his suggestion. He said Brown broke a promise. Brown never made a promise, which is a critical difference. It is why Mandel’s claim gets a rating of Mostly False.

pomt-15073	"Under Republicans, recessions happen four times as frequently as under Democrats."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/22/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-recessions-more-frequent-under-rep/	Recently, Hillary Clinton has been making the ultimate pocketbook argument for her candidacy: When there’s a Democrat in the White House, she says, the economy does better. Earlier in this campaign season, she said the stock market does better under Democrats. In a speech to the New Hampshire Democratic Party Convention on Sept. 19, Clinton went even further. "I know it’s inconvenient for our Republican friends, but the facts do speak for themselves," the former secretary of state said. "Economic growth is stronger under Democratic presidents. Unemployment is lower. The stock market rises faster. Businesses do better, and deficits are smaller. And one of my favorite inconvenient facts is under Republicans, recessions happen four times as frequently as under Democrats." In this fact-check, we decided to focus the claim that recessions are four times as likely under Republicans as they are under Democrats. A look at the numbers The primary research on this question -- and the source cited by the Clinton campaign when we asked -- comes from a paper written by two Princeton University economists, Alan Blinder and Mark Watson. The paper, published in July 2014, found that the economy tends to do better under Democratic presidents by numerous measures. The authors looked at quarterly economic data from 1947 through mid 2013 and the National Bureau of Economic Research’s official list of recessions and found that Clinton’s claim is pretty much on point. Since 1947, there have been 11 official recessions, totaling 49 recessionary quarters. Of those 49 quarters, just eight occurred under Democratic presidents, compared to 41 under Republicans. So, over the past 65 years, quarters in recession were about five times more common under a Republican president than under a Democratic president. "Sec. Clinton is correct in her claim," Watson, one of the paper’s authors, told PolitiFact. Looking at how many recessions started under Republicans, the difference is even more stark, noted Blinder, the co-author. Of the 11 recessions since 1947, nine under Republicans, compared to just two under Democrats. The paper also looked further back in history to 1875 and found that the trend held, though it was less pronounced. But what does this mean? Economists emphasize, however, that Clinton’s claim needs some additional context. Clinton presumably wants listeners to believe that Republican policies don’t work for the economy. But the research doesn’t necessarily support this contention. There are far too many factors that contribute to the country’s economic health. "Democrats would no doubt like to attribute the large (Democratic/Republican) growth gap to macroeconomic policy choices, but the data do not support such a claim," the Blinder-Watson paper says. In short, the paper found that half of the Democrats’ economic advantage is a result of factors outside the control of the White House, Congress or the Federal Reserve. The other half "remains a mystery," Watson said. "It seems we must look instead to several variables that are mostly ‘good luck,’ with perhaps a touch of ‘good policy,’" the report says. One section of the paper (it’s on page 14) gives an overview of booms and busts since World War II. It concludes that it’s difficult to draw a direct line from a president’s fiscal policy positions to economic cycles. For example, defense spending led to prosperity during the Korean War under Democratic President Harry Truman. His successor, Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower, ended the war, and thus the prosperity turned into recession. Energy price shocks are another important factor, since they can produce economic downturns. Unfortunately for the Republicans, shocks hit during the presidencies of Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and George W. Bush, compared to just once under a Democrat, Jimmy Carter. The authors add that Democratic presidents have benefited from higher "total factor productivity," which is essentially a measure of technological growth and dynamism. A clear example is the technology boom under Bill Clinton, which produced significant productivity gains. The authors acknowledge that it’s unclear why this has been the case under Democratic presidents. And sometimes the fiscal policy of a previous administration bleeds into the next one -- so just because a recession happened when one president was in office, the prior administration might bear some of the responsibility. While Democratic President Lyndon Johnson saw no recessions, for instance, his administration had to implement anti-inflation policies near the end of his tenure. Those policies contributed to a recession early on in Nixon’s term. Because of all the factors at play, assigning credit for economic results is tricky, said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University professor and chief economist for the job site Indeed.com. In fact, it’s possible that causation actually runs the other way. "It's possible that the public votes in response to economic conditions," she added, "meaning political cycles can follow economic cycles." Our ruling Clinton said that "under Republicans, recessions happen four times as frequently as under Democrats." The numbers back up Clinton’s claim since World War II: Of the 49 quarters in recession since 1947, eight occurred under Democrats, while 41 occurred under Republicans. It’s important to note, however, that many factors contribute to general well-being of the economy, so one shouldn’t treat Clinton’s implication -- that Democratic presidencies are better for the economy -- with irrational exuberance. Clinton is right on the numbers, but her claim needs additional information to put its implication into the proper context. We rate her claim Mostly True.

pomt-14105	"For the first time in over 40 years, Republicans don’t hold a single statewide office" in Virginia.	true	/virginia/statements/2016/may/12/ed-gillespie/ed-gillespie-says-gop-shut-out-va-statewide-office/	Ed Gillespie says he’s convinced that the Republican philosophy of "limited, effective" government is just what Virginia needs. But there’s a hitch. "To enact those policies, we must first win elections because for the first time in over 40 years, Republicans don’t hold a single statewide office," Gillespie, who plans to run for governor next year, said in an April 30 speech at the GOP state convention. We wondered if this really is the first time in more than four decades that no Republican holds any of Virginia’s five statewide offices. The 2013 sweep in statewide elections for governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general by Terry McAuliffe, Ralph Northam and Mark Herring, respectively, left Democrats in full control of Virginia’s executive posts. Democrats Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, meanwhile, hold Virginia’s two U.S. Senate seats. If you’re a political junkie, stop here for a minute. Try to figure out the last full year - before 2014 - that Democrats had such a lock. Now, let’s go back in time together. From 2010 through 2013, Gov. Bob McDonnell, Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling and Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli - all of them Republicans - held the state’s top three positions. Actually, the GOP had at least one of those three offices every year since the early 1990s, when Democrats held them all under Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, Lt. Gov. Don Beyer and Attorney General Mary Sue Terry. But even with no Republicans holding an executive post in state government, the GOP back then had John Warner, who served in the U.S. Senate from 1979 until 2009. You have to go back to 1969 to find the last full year when Democrats held all five statewide posts. That year, Gov. Mills Godwin, Lt. Gov. Fred Pollard and Attorney General Robert Button were in office along with U.S. Sens. Harry F. Byrd Jr. and William B. Spong Jr. Later that year, Linwood Holton became the first Republican elected governor in Virginia. He was inaugurated Jan. 17, 1970. Byrd and Godwin, like many Southerners, abandoned the Democratic Party in the early 1970s as it moved to the left. Byrd became an independent in 1971 and, two years later, Godwin was re-elected governor as a Republican. Why is the GOP now frozen out of statewide seats? A key reason is demographics, said Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of Virginia. Much of Virginia’s population growth in recent decades has been in urban and suburban areas that tend to vote Democratic, such as Northern Virginia, Hampton Roads and greater Richmond, as well as in university towns, Sabato said. "This really started in the 1960s, in a big way," he said. Voters in rural parts of the state remain receptive to socially conservative ideas that Republicans embrace, but "that’s not where the people are," Sabato said.

A website called As American as Apple Pie posted this headline on Sept. 7: "Georgia Mosque KEEPS Hurricane Harvey Donations, Will Send To Syrian Refugees Instead." The item cited Imam Sharaj Alkalb of the Ramazala Mosque in Peachton who allegedly said, "Because Donald Trump will not let victims of war and crime seek solitude in the United States, we can not in good conscience help his people when so many Muslims can not find shelter." There is not a whisper of truth to this piece. For starters, there is no Peachton, Ga. A website named Salatomatic lists mosques around the country. There is no Ramazala Mosque in Georgia. The article urges readers to "call the Ramazala Mosque at (330) 366-6476 and give them a piece of your mind." The 330 area code covers Akron, Ohio. The number is the same number as the one listed on the As American as Apple Pie Facebook page. That Facebook page describes the website as an entertainment website launched in 2024. A similar version of this story on another website claimed that police arrested Alkalb. That item quoted the "local newspaper, the Peachton Herald." That paper is as made up as the town of Peachton.

pomt-06872	Medicaid is the primary source of health insurance for 41.7 percent of Hispanic children in Georgia.	true	/georgia/statements/2011/aug/01/la-raza/nearly-half-hispanic-children-georgia-rely-medicai/	In a recent broadcast, WABE-FM (90.1) led into a story on the impact of proposed deficit-cutting measures with a shocking number. "Forty-one point seven percent of Latino children in Georgia rely on Medicaid programs for health care," the reporter said, before cutting to tape of Jennifer Ng’andu, deputy director of health policy for the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic advocacy group. Ng’andu said a Republican-led proposal in Congress to cut the deficit, in part with $1.4 trillion in cuts to Medicaid over 10 years, would have disproportionate effect on Hispanics because they are more likely to rely on taxpayer-funded health care. That figure – 41.7 percent – is eye-popping. We wondered if it was accurate. The number comes from La Raza’s report "The Meaning of Medicaid: A State-by-State Breakdown," recently released as a rebuttal to the GOP plan. It turns out the nexus here is between race or ethnicity and poverty. More than a quarter of Hispanics in the United States live in poverty, according to the U.S. census. The poverty rate has gotten worse in recent years for everybody, but Hispanics and blacks have the higher percentages of their ranks among the poor. The census figures do not delve into immigration status -- whether someone is here legally or illegally. Some critics of illegal immigration contend that U.S. taxpayers should not be liable for the medical costs of anyone in the country illegally. This fact-check makes no attempt to wade into that controversy. Children – defined by the census as people under 18 – also are more likely to be in poverty than any other age category. The most recent figures indicate 20.7 percent of young people meet the federal definition of poverty. Census figures tie together poverty and a lack of insurance. The percentage of all people without insurance rose from 15.4 percent in 2008 to 16.7 percent in 2009, according to a report released late last year. That’s 50.7 million people without insurance. Broken down by race or ethnicity, the census calculates that 32.4 percent of Hispanics are uninsured. That’s significantly higher than blacks (21 percent), Asians (17.2 percent) or whites (12 percent). Not surprisingly, income affects insurance rates. Nearly 27 percent of people making $25,000 a year or less are uninsured, according to the census. So, the poor are more likely to be uninsured and Latinos are more likely to be uninsured. But is the number correct? We contacted the Kaiser Family Foundation, which acts as a clearinghouse for health-related data, to see if the figure quoted for Georgia is correct. According to foundation spokesman Chris Lee, it checks out – or comes very close. Lee said the figure they came up with is 41 percent even, using a three-year average of census data. Ng’andu said La Raza used the same source to get its figure. In terms of raw numbers, that’s about 120,000 Latino children in the state relying on Medicaid for health care. Medicaid is a federal program administered -- and jointly funded -- by the states that provides medical care to low-income people and the disabled, although eligibility varies by state. It covers a wide range of health-related costs, from doctor’s visits to nursing home care. Nationally, the states and federal government put about $339 billion into Medicaid, with the federal government picking up 57 percent of the total cost, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. The program costs Georgia $1.7 billion, and that figure is expected to climb with a planned federal expansion of the program that would add an estimated 650,000 people in 2014. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates the additional costs to be around $714 million, while the governor’s office has projected the cost of the expansion at $2.5 billion over the next decade. Currently, about one in six Georgia residents is enrolled in Medicaid, and most of those are children. La Raza is highlighting the high percentage of Latino children on the Medicaid rolls as an argument against cutting the program to lower the federal deficit. That’s a subject for political debate, not PolitiFact. For the purposes of this fact-check, the number in the WABE broadcast appears to be on target. We rate this claim True.

pomt-07110	Says former Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Alvarez and current mayoral candidate Carlos Gimenez both drove fancy European cars at taxpayer expense.	half-true	/florida/statements/2011/jun/20/accountability-project/miami-mayors-race-third-party-group-tries-tie-carl/	The two candidates for Miami-Dade mayor -- Carlos Gimenez and Julio Robaina -- share much in common. Both are Republicans. Both are Cuban-Americans. Both have served in government before -- Gimenez as fire chief, Miami city manager and Miami-Dade county commissioner and Robaina as the mayor of Hialeah. And both need to cast themselves as thrifty reformers as they compete to replace Carlos Alvarez, recalled in March by voters angry about the county doling out raises to most employees amid property tax hikes for homeowners. Any suggestion that a candidate shares traits in common with Alvarez -- particularly his willingness to spend lavishly on high-level county officials including himself -- could doom a candidate in the June 28 nonpartisan election. Now comes an ad from a third-party group, The Accountability Project, trying to portray Alvarez and Gimenez as one and the same. What they share -- according to this ad -- are taxpayer-funded luxury cars. The ad starts with an unflattering photo of a grumpy looking Alvarez next to a photo of car keys in the ignition as an ominous voice says: "Carlos Alvarez drove a fancy European car at taxpayer expense." "Carlos Gimenez also drove a fancy European car at taxpayer expense." "Carlos Alvarez: a BMW that we paid for." "Carlos Gimenez: a Mercedes-Benz that we paid for." "Tens of thousands of tax dollars spent on luxury cars." "Alvarez was the mayor. Gimenez wants to be mayor. Carlos Alvarez and Carlos Gimenez: They can't be part of the solution because both are part of the problem." The ad's message -- complete with images of luxury cars and a TV popping out of a car dashboard -- is clear: Alvarez and Gimenez both wasted taxpayer dollars on luxury cars. Alvarez=Gimenez. The only difference is one drove a BMW and the other, a Mercedes-Benz. Or is that the only difference? PolitiFact Florida wanted to take a look under the hood of the car deals for Alvarez and Gimenez. And, since it's relevant, we also decided to examine Robaina's use of city cars when he was Hialeah's mayor. Our ultimate goal is to decide whether the ad fairly compares the political figures based on their taxpayer-funded luxury cars. First, some background about The Accountability Project. The Electioneering Communication Organization is registered to political consultant Keith Donner who told us in an e-mail June 16 that his ECO is not connected to any campaign but that he is "absolutely supporting Robaina." Donner referred us to Herald articles to obtain details about car allowances. A breakdown man by man, car by car We did our own research about Alvarez, Gimenez and Robaina and their use of government cars or car allowances. We contacted the Gimenez and Robaina campaigns and officials in Miami-Dade County and Hialeah to attempt to pull together information about the officials' past car allowances. But first, a general word about making such comparisons. Car allowances -- or the use of city-owned cars -- is one piece of an official's compensation package that may include salary, expenses, health insurance and pensions. We are not providing a full comparison here of every part of the officials' compensation -- but we think its worth looking at the benefit of the car allowance within the context of their salaries and expense accounts. The Miami-Dade Mayor's job is considered full time -- the Herald wrote in 2010 that the mayor earns $233,123, the county commissioner job pays $6,000 a year. The mayor's position in Hialeah is unusual because the mayor, who earns around $155,000 a year, is essentially also the city manager. Let's look at each official: Carlos Gimenez Gimenez was a county commissioner between 2004 and 2011 when he stepped down to run for mayor. In his final year he was earning an annual salary of $6,000 plus about $55,000 in benefits, including the car allowance. J.C. Planas, an attorney for the Gimenez campaign and a former state legislator, told us in an e-mail that Gimenez was entitled to the same car allowances as all the commissioners. For the last year and a half, Gimenez drove a Mercedes-Benz ML and prior to that a Mercedes-Benz E320. Gimenez said in a June 16 interview that his most recent car, the Mercedes-Benz ML, was silver, and he thought it was a 2009 car. He said it was $2.44 above the $800 monthly car allowance and that he paid for that out of his own pocket. The Mercedes Benz website lists the 2011 ML at $46,490 (before options are added) and describes its "unparalleled ride quality" this way: the car "offers stylish proof that utility and safety can coexist enthusiastically with performance and luxury. Ruggedly capable, truly versatile and every inch a Mercedes-Benz, it's a vehicle that feels at home anywhere you go." (We're not certain if the features changed from 2009 but the Kelley Blue Book listed a similar price for the 2009 car.) Gimenez doesn't dispute that he had a car allowance -- but he said that Alvarez had access to more cars and drivers. "Here is the difference between me and Alvarez," Gimenez said. "Alvarez had a personal car -- $800 a month. But he also had two SUVs and a set of drivers." Gimenez said he drove himself the majority of the time and estimated he used a driver fewer than 10 times in six years. "Unlike the city of Hialeah where the mayor gets a substantial salary in excess of pretty much any city of the county, county commissioners basically make nothing," Planas said. "Their salary is their benefits -- one of which is their car allowance. They receive the benefit because their salary is so puny." Julio Robaina Robaina was the mayor of Hialeah between 2005 and 2011 when he resigned to run for mayor. His campaign spokeswoman, Ana Carbonell, said in an e-mail that while mayor, Robaina did not receive a car allowance but drove a city-issued 2004 Chevy Tahoe and later a 2009 Chevy Suburban. His last annual salary was $154,655 and he had an expense account of $116,175. During the 2010-11 year, he took a 7 percent insurance contribution deduction, according to Hialeah Acting City Clerk David Concepcion. Concepcion confirmed that Robaina didn't get a car allowance. Robaina drove a Chevy Tahoe starting in December 2005 through 2007 and then a Chevy Suburban from 2007 until May 2011, Concepcion said in an e-mail. Though Carbonell, Robaina's spokeswoman, said Robaina had nothing to do with The Accountability Project, we asked her if she thought the ad comparing the car allowances of Alvarez and Gimenez was fair since it omits that Robaina had city-issued cars. "The issue is the luxury vehicle in economic times the county is facing," she said. "Is it appropriate for county commissioners to drive a luxury vehicle? That's what the ad points to." Carlos Alvarez The Herald has written extensively about the luxury car perks of Miami-Dade county officials. On May 23, 2010 the Herald wrote that the mayor and commissioners were keeping the perk of taxpayer-subsidized luxury cars although they were slashing more than $400 million in spending. Among those cars were Gimenez's 2009 Mercedes Benz ML 350, and Alvarez's BMW 550i Gran Turismo. That was in addition, the Herald reported, to two county-owned Chevy Suburbans and two drivers Alvarez had access to. BMW's website lists the price of the BMW at $64,400. The Herald wrote that the specifications for the bid for a BMW for Alvarez included: "black sapphire metallic exterior, ivory white and black Nappa leather interiors, ash grain wood trim and 20-inch double spoke wheels." The Herald included a list of various commissioners' car allowances: the politicians generally chose 2010 cars including a Lexus, Cadillac, Sawgrass Infiniti, Toyota Prius and a Ford Taurus. Some chose the $800 monthly stipend instead of leasing or renting a car. Starting this fiscal year in October 2010, the benefit was scaled back to $600 a month for the mayor but remained $800 month for commissioners. After Alvarez was recalled in March, the county returned his leased car early but the county still had to pay most of the tab, the Herald reported April 6, 2011. The county paid the full lease cost up front: $41,849. When the county turned the car in 10 months into a 30-month lease, South Motors BMW gave $4,000 back. Gimenez told us -- and Miami-Dade County spokeswoman Vanessa Santana-Penate confirmed -- he took over his lease when he left his commissioner job. To be clear, car allowances for elected officials aren't unusual in South Florida. Some government entities provide elected officials with a specified car allowance -- like in Broward County and the City of Miami Beach -- while others provide a more general allowance that can be used toward a car. Our ruling Let's revisit the claim in the ad from the group attacking Gimenez. "Carlos Alvarez drove a fancy European car at taxpayer expense. Carlos Gimenez also drove a fancy European car at taxpayer expense." No one disputes that Alvarez and Gimenez both drove luxury cars paid for by taxpayers. But the ad omits several key facts: • Taxpayer-funded car deals for elected officials are common. The perk was available to all the Miami-Dade county commissioners. Even Gimenez's opponent Robaina was given cars by the city to drive while he was mayor of Hialeah. While the cars driven by Robaina, a Chevy Tahoe and a Chevy Suburban aren't "fancy European" cars, they are nice cars. • Alvarez and Gimenez did not have identical car deals. Alvarez went shopping for a BMW on the county dime even though he already had access to two Chevys and two police officers to drive him. When Gimenez left the county he said he took over the lease -- unlike Alvarez who left the county on the hook. • Comparing the car allowances of Gimenez and Alvarez without looking at other pieces of their compensation package provides an incomplete picture of two different jobs. Alvarez earned about 39 times more than Gimenez in salary -- though to be fair Alvarez likely logged many more hours. It's true that both Alvarez and Gimenez used their county-paid car allowances to drive luxury cars -- either one could have refused the benefit or not used it in full. But the Truth-O-Meter isn't about merely evaluating whether a statement is technically true -- context and telling the full story matters. This ad fails to do that. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-04192	Milwaukee County government employees pay "much more" for their health care than City of Milwaukee or State of Wisconsin employees.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/dec/09/marina-dimitrijevic/milwaukee-county-board-chairwoman-says-county-empl/	Defending a tax increase that helped county employees pay for health insurance, Milwaukee County Board Chairwoman Marina Dimitrijevic told a Milwaukee radio interviewer that workers had seen those costs rise substantially two years in a row. She deflected a question about private-sector benefits, saying the proper comparison point for county benefit costs is what other government workers pay. "When you compare them (Milwaukee County employees) to the City of Milwaukee and the State of Wisconsin, they are paying much more than their counterparts," Dimitrijevic told WTMJ-AM (620) afternoon show host John Mercure on Nov. 14, 2012. "You have to compare apples to apples." It’s been well-publicized that Gov. Scott Walker’s Act 10 collective bargaining law increased state employees’ health care costs. And Milwaukee -- while not under Act 10’s health care mandates -- got its workers to pick up a greater share of such costs in the wake of the law. But are county workers paying "much more" than state and city employees? It’s an interesting question, given the prominence of the health care issue in the 2012 county budget tussle between the County Board and County Executive Chris Abele, who again had sought larger cost-sharing from employees. First, a few words of caution. While there are credible ways to compare health insurance plans, it’s a complicated exercise because costs can vary significantly depending on employees’ health and the intricacies of each plan’s design. For simplicity’s sake, our analysis is based on insurance costs for current employees, not for retirees. The figures discussed here apply to most, but not all, employees of the three governments. We examined reports that Dimitrijevic says she relied on in making her claim, and spoke with city, county and state officials about their health plan offerings for 2013. We’ll start with two key measures: Plan design State employees have no annual deductible, receive 90 percent co-insurance and have comparatively low limits on yearly out-of-pocket costs (ranging from $500 for single coverage to $1,000 for families). That gives them a clear advantage over city and county workers. Most City of Milwaukee workers chose a plan with deductibles of $500 to $1,000 and out-of-pocket caps of $1,000 per person/$2,000 family. The co-insurance picks up 90 percent. The city plan does not charge co-pays for office visits. County workers face the highest deductibles ($800-$1,850) and by far the highest out-of-pocket limits ($2,500 per person to $5,000 per family). Office and prescription co-pays do not count toward that maximum. Their co-insurance pays less than at the city and state -- 80 percent. But for 2013, the County Board, over Abele’s objection, funded a county contribution to employees to reimburse them for eligible health care expenditures such as co-pays, deductibles, co-insurance, dental care, or vision care. The county contribution to these "flexible spending accounts" ranges from $600 for a single employee to $1,800 for a family. So that can offset most of an employee’s costs up to the deductible. And county officials say it brings those county employees who use very little health care into rough parity with city employees. Still, county workers face higher out-of-pocket payments than city workers if their medical costs mount. And the difference could amount to several hundred dollars, or a couple thousand dollars in a bad health year, so it’s significant. It’s not clear how many people fall into the higher-use group, though after 10 months of 2012 about 35 percent had met their deductible. That includes retirees, but the figure for active workers would be comparable, said the county’s benefits administrator, Matthew Hanchek. Monthly Premiums County workers pay the highest premiums, and they can’t use that county contribution towards them. City employees are on the low end with premiums ranging from $54 monthly to $173 in the most popular plan. Most state workers will pay $85 to $211. By contrast, county workers will pay $100 to $225 a month, putting another gap between them and the rest. Let’s try to tally it up: It’s clear that state employees have the lowest costs. That leaves county vs. city. We asked the county’s Hanchek about the city vs. county comparison. He said the flexible spending contribution brings the county plan close to parity with the city’s when you consider all active members. There’s some support for that by another measure: the collective employee share of their employer’s total health care bill. At the county, that figure is a projected 23 percent to 27 percent for 2013, depending on which measure from several county sources you prefer. The city is in the 23 percent to 25 percent range, said Michael Brady, city employee benefits director. To the extent those figures are apples-to-apples, they suggest there isn’t much difference between the plans as a whole. Benefits officials caution that these aggregate figures don’t necessarily reflect a typical employee’s experience. Hanchek did note that the city’s premium costs are a bit lower than the county’s, which he attributed mainly to demographic factors. County Comptroller Scott Manske looked at the situation a different way and drew this conclusion: At higher usage levels, county workers likely face much higher out-of-pocket costs, compared with city workers. At average usage levels, it’s a wash or the county worker could pay a little more, he said. We’ll give the final word to Richard Abelson, executive director of AFSCME District Council 48, the labor organization that represents many city and county employees. Both employee groups have been asked to pay more for health benefits in recent years, Abelson said. The bottom line, in Abelson’s view, is that city workers pay a little bit less than their county counterparts, even when the county’s flexible spending account is considered. One final note. We found that city workers earn $50,476 on average, slightly more than state ($49,534) and county workers ($50,188), so at least in a rough sense city employees may have a bit more ability to pay. Our rating Dimitrijevic said Milwaukee County government employees are paying "much more" for health insurance than their counterparts at the City of Milwaukee and in state government. There’s mixed evidence, but we think a fair reading of the numbers is that some county employees will pay more. The precise number is hard to judge. And those people could pay out "much more" if you think hundreds of dollars a year or more is a big deal. But there’s an important detail here that undercuts Dimitrijevic’s claim: the county’s contribution to workers’ flexible spending accounts. Because of that, some city and county employees ultimately may pay similar amounts when you factor in that taxpayer-funded contribution. We rate Dimitrijevic’s statement Half True.

pomt-12414	California Gov. Jerry Brown has proposed "diverting 30 percent of the funding" from the state’s gas tax increase "to non-road related projects like building parks and job training for felons."	mostly false	/california/statements/2017/may/19/melissa-melendez/jerry-brown-proposing-divert-30-percent-new-gas-ta/	Drivers in California will start paying a higher gas tax this fall, as part of a bill signed by Gov. Jerry Brown to raise money for the state’s deteriorating roads and bridges. But when that tax hike kicks in, how much revenue will go to road projects? Republican State Assemblywoman Melissa Melendez claimed in a press release and on Twitter on May 11, 2017 that a large chunk will be siphoned off for anything but roads. "Governor Brown and his fellow Democrats are already diverting funding to their own pet projects," she said in the press release. "In this budget proposal, they are diverting 30 percent of funding from the gas tax to non-road related projects like building parks and job training for felons. That’s money from the very gas tax the Democrats promised would go solely to fixing our decrepit roads and providing relief for traffic congestion." The gas tax increase is part of a larger transportation funding legislation signed by Brown in April 2017. In common speech, some politicians simply call this "the gas tax." It includes an initial 12 cent per gallon gas tax increase that starts in November; a diesel tax hike; and a new "transportation improvement fee" ranging from $25 to $175 per year, depending on the value of one’s vehicle. We wrote about how this new tax will affect the state's already high gas tax rate here and gas prices here. It passed the Legislature with the help of Democrats and one Republican state senator. Melendez, who represents Riverside County, strongly opposed it. There’s no doubt roads are the main focus of the funding package. The measure was even called The Road Repair and Accountability Act of 2017. We decided to examine two key parts of Melendez’s claim: Did Brown’s budget ‘divert’ 30 percent of the transportation funding? And was this money being siphoned off for ‘non-road’ related projects? We buckled up for a fact check. Our research Melendez’s spokesman Sam Spencer showed us a chart in the governor’s revised May budget that he said backs up the claim. It shows proposals for spending $2.8 billion of the new transportation revenue in the next fiscal year on various programs. Local streets and roads would get $445 million; bridges and culverts would receive $400 million and congested corridors would get $250 million. Spencer highlighted other categories he said "are clearly not programs intended to fix our crumbling roads." Those, Spencer said, include rail, transit, active transportation such as bikeways and pedestrian paths, parks and recreation, food and agriculture, university research and workforce development programs. Brown’s budget calls for spending $818.7 million on those. That’s about 29 percent of the overall $2.8 billion in new funding from the transportation package. It just about matches Melendez’s claim that 30 percent of the new revenue is being set aside for what appear to be non-road projects. Assemblywoman Melissa Melendez's office said this chart from the governor's May budget backs up the claim. Response from Brown Administration We asked the governor’s staff about Melendez’s claim and about the categories that seem to have little to do with roads. Malcolm Dougherty, director of the California Department of Transportation, took issue with Melendez’s characterization that the budget "diverts" any money from its intended purpose. "The dollars are being used exactly the way SB 1 presented them," Dougherty said, referring to the number of the Senate transportation funding bill that was signed into law. "The funding package was always intended to include transit and rail." Transit, rail and active transportation programs represent about one-quarter of the proposed new spending. Paul Golaszewski, who researches transportation funding at the nonpartisan California Legislative Analyst’s Office, agreed the governor’s budget "adheres to SB1." He also noted that in future years, the share of money devoted purely to road projects, increases under the state’s funding plans. Why parks and job training? But that still leaves the question of why parks, universities, workforce and farm programs are getting any gas tax money. And whether those categories have anything to do with road projects. Dougherty, the Caltrans director, said that before SB1 was signed, existing laws required some gas tax revenue go to state parks and food and agriculture programs. Parks collect a portion of the tax on gasoline sales for off-road vehicles using the parks. Likewise, Dougherty said, food and agriculture programs get a slice of gas tax revenue when farmers purchase fuel for their vehicles, also under an existing law. Both laws remain in place after SB1. Dougherty added that the revenue for the parks and workforce training, the two categories cited by Melendez in her statement, represent less than 3 percent of the transportation revenue. The University of California and California State University systems will get a combined $7 million of the new revenue for what Dougherty called "transportation related research." Finally, he said, the state’s workforce development board will get $5 million to prepare workers for jobs created by the transportation spending. Melendez’s spokesman pointed to a state workforce board budget document that proposes using that money for "pre-apprenticeship training programs, focused on formerly incarcerated, women and minorities." SB 1 calls for the workforce board to create those programs. It also authorized the money for the universities. Our ruling California state Assemblywoman Melissa Melendez recently claimed Gov. Jerry Brown’s budget is "diverting 30 percent of funding from the gas tax to non-road related projects like building parks and job training for felons." There’s some truth to her claim: The governor’s May budget shows about 30 percent of the revenue from this transportation measure goes to categories that won’t directly improve roads for cars and trucks, as dictated by the law Brown signed in April. Most of that 30 percent goes to bicycle, transit and rail projects. Melendez, however, cherry-picked two programs -- parks and workforce training -- that represent less than 3 percent of the overall funding. Melendez’s statement also ignores the fact that roads will see an increased share of the overall funding in future years. Additionally, it’s misleading and simply not accurate for Melendez to say this money is being ‘diverted’ when Brown’s budget proposes to spend the money exactly as outlined in the bill he signed and the Legislature passed a month earlier. There should be no surprise, at this point, that the measure required funding for transit programs, railways and bicycle and pedestrian paths. The smaller spending on parks, universities and workforce development may raise eyebrows, but was also authorized by SB 1. Melendez’s overall statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate her claim Mostly False.

pomt-02326	"I was the most bipartisan senator in the United States Senate."	mostly true	/new-hampshire/statements/2014/mar/27/scott-brown/scott-brown-says-he-was-most-bipartisan-senator/	Former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown began his fledgling campaign the same way he ended his last one: touting his bipartisan credentials. Brown, who served three years in the Senate before being ousted by Massachusetts voters in 2012, formed an exploratory committee in March 2014 to consider a run against Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen in New Hampshire. Brown embarked on a listening tour soon after, and during a visit to Portsmouth, a familiar claim of bipartisanship resurfaced. "I was the most bipartisan senator in the United States Senate," Brown said, according to a report published in The Portsmouth Herald. "I voted 50-50. So I worked with everybody. And here's the problem, I was the most bipartisan senator." Brown made the exact same claim during a visit to the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Nashua on April 4, 2013, where he added, "That’s, I think, what people want." But does Brown really have the strongest record of bipartisanship? PolitiFact New Hampshire decided to look into the question. Bipartisanship can be measured a number of ways, according to political analysts and researchers alike. Endorsements, group memberships and bill sponsorships can be telling about a lawmakers’ willingness to reach across the aisle. But measurements of party unity or opposition votes – that is, the rate at which a lawmaker sides with or against members of his or her own party – is the gold standard measure of bipartisanship, experts said. So, for the purposes of this check, we’ll stick to that. Brown pointed to four sources, including a "Best and Worst" list from Washington Magazine labelling him as the "Least Partisan" senator of 2012. Brown also cited research from Congressional Quarterly Roll Call, which he said deemed him the country’s second most bipartisan senator in 2011. Each year, Congressional Quarterly prints a report detailing senators’ party unity and opposition votes, defined as votes cast either with or against a majority from their party. According to the data, Brown, who took office in February 2010, sided with a Democratic majority on 22 percent of votes in his first year, ranking him seventh among all senators. The next year, he voted with Democrats 46 percent of the time, trailing only Sen. Susan Collins of Maine. In 2012, he rose to the top of the list, siding with a Democratic majority close to 62 percent of the time, according to the annual report, which was printed in the January 21, 2013 issue of CQ Weekly. In recent years, Congressional Quarterly has been joined by other media vote-counters. As part of their Congress Votes Database, Washington Post researchers track votes using a similar methodology, looking at votes in which a majority of senators took a side on an issue. The numbers differed slightly, but the Post researchers came to a similar conclusion after analyzing Brown’s voting records. Over his final two years in the Senate, Brown’s cooperation with Democrats increased. He and Collins were in a virtual dead-heat, differing with the Republican party more frequently than other Senators in 2011 and 2012, according to the Washington Post list. Meanwhile, Bloomberg Government, a subsidiary of the media service that focuses on government information, studied unity votes as well, excluding some types of votes such as nominations and treaty votes. This research, covering Brown’s final two years in office, showed he voted with a Democratic majority 53 percent of the time. Several media outlets reported this figure as being second highest in the country, trailing only Collins. Collins and Olympia Snowe, another Maine Republican who retired in 2012, are widely considered two of the nation’s most bipartisan senators. Ryan Kelly, a senior researcher at Congressional Quarterly, cautioned that in certain cases, party unity votes don’t necessarily reflect true bipartisan cooperation. But he said that for Brown, Collins and Snowe, the votes do signal bipartisan cooperation. "Sens. Collins, Brown and Snowe -- they’re not extremists or anything. They probably broke to the side of their Democratic colleagues more often than people in the House, like the tea partiers," he said. Brown "was more bipartisan than most of his colleagues," agreed Patrick Griffin, a professor of government at American University in Washington, D.C. "It may have been a function of the state he represented and probably anticipating what kind of race he might have (for re-election in Massachusetts in 2012). But there’s no doubt he showed a willingness to reach across the aisle." Our ruling Judging by votes alone, Brown was not always the most bipartisan senator during his time in office, but he was No. 1 for a time, and was close for the rest of the time. We rate Brown’s claim Mostly True.	None	Scott Brown	None	None	None	2014-03-27T11:31:28	2014-03-18	['United_States_Senate']
pomt-09717	A new federal program provides subsidized "Obama phones" with 70 free minutes of cell phone service every month.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/28/chain-email/chain-e-mail-claims-obama-handing-out-free-cell-ph/	A reader recently sent us a chain e-mail about a cell phone deal. "Receive (1) a FREE new phone and (2) approx 70 minutes of FREE minutes every month," the e-mail said. The catch? They're only available to welfare recipients. "I had a former employee call me earlier today inquiring about a job, and at the end of the conversation he gave me his phone number," the e-mail said. "I asked the former employee if this was a new cell phone number and he told me yes this was his 'Obama phone'... TAX PAYER MONEY IS BEING REDISTRIBUTED TO WELFARE RECIPIENTS FOR FREE CELL PHONES." The chain e-mail — we've received copies from several readers — calls them "Obama phones," which suggests the program is new. It says the cell phone program threatens "the very foundations that this country was built on," and "the age old concepts of God, family, and hard work." A federal program offering 70 minutes a month sounded unusual to us, so we decided to look into it. The e-mail included a link to the TracPhone Web site, a prepaid cell phone company, and its SafeLink Wireless program to help low-income people get cellular coverage. Depending on where participants live, free phones and free minutes are available; participants in Washington, D.C., for example, can get 55 free minutes per month, while consumers in Florida can get 68 free minutes a month. AT&T and Verizon provide similar services. All those perks are the result of Federal Communications Commission programs to help low-income people get phone service. Specifically, Lifeline, which TracPhone participates in, provides discounts on basic monthly phone service, and Link-Up America helps those who qualify get telephone service by paying one-half of the startup fee, according to the FCC Web site. Eligible participants must have an income that is at or below 135 percent of the federal poverty level or use Medicaid, food stamps, federal public housing assistance, or supplemental security income, among other things. In some cases, states administer their own programs. We spoke with Rosemary Kimball, an FCC spokeswoman, to get more details. She said consumers can qualify for a cell phone plan if they don't have access to a land-line. Though the exact details of the benefit vary from state to state, cell phone providers typically provide low-income consumers with some form of a monthly discount, whether it be free minutes or a reduced rate, she said. And here's a key detail: The program is more than decade old. Kimball said it comes from the 1996 Telecommunications Act, which amended the Communications Act of 1934 to require low-income assistance. The law required the FCC to create the Universal Service Fund, a pool of money subsidized by small charges on our phone bills (we checked our bill and found we kicked in $2.80 last month) and redistributed to the low-income service programs as well as programs that bring telecommunications services to rural areas and schools. And the LifeLine program has been around even longer — since 1985. It's a matter of opinion whether this program threatens the very foundations this country was built on. But the e-mail is correct that tax dollars are being used to support the cell phone program. Still, it mischaracterizes the program by making it seem as if it was created by the Obama administration. In fact, Lifeline and Link-Up have been around for nearly 14 years. These are not "Obama phones." (Maybe we should call them "Clinton phones.") So we rate the claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-14099	Says Arizona, Missouri and Texas residents have a two-pet limit, so the public must "surrender their third pet to the Humane Society."	pants on fire!	/arizona/statements/2016/may/13/blog-posting/popular-internet-story-claims-arizona-missouri-and/	Do not fret, the pug or feline in your life won’t be given to the Humane Society. A popular May 6 story from a website called "Associated Media Coverage" claims that Arizona, Missouri and Texas recently passed two-pet limit laws. "According to state representatives, pet owners within Texas, Arizona, and Missouri are expected to be in compliance with the new ordinance by September 2016. All pet owners are expected to surrender any pets in excess of the mandatory ‘2-pet maximum’ to their local Humane Society shelter by the compliance date of September 3rd 2016," the story reads. We reached out to Associated Media Coverage and did not hear back. Nonetheless, experts quickly dismissed this claim. Not a ‘hare’ of truth "This is, in fact, a hoax, and The Humane Society of the United States would never support such an ordinance," Humane Society spokeswoman Cheylin Parker said. Locally, we also reached out to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey’s office. "This couldn’t be further from the truth," said Daniel Scarpinato, a spokesman for Ducey. "There’s no such law in Arizona, and as a huge animal lover himself, Governor Ducey encourages animal adoption all across our state." Others have debunked this story, too. The Snopes website debunked the claim and noted that the Associated Media Coverage website appears to have been registered in February 2016. Our ruling Associated Media Coverage said, "pet owners within Texas, Arizona and Missouri...are expected to surrender any pets in excess of the mandatory ‘2-pet maximum’ to their local Humane Society." That’s a ridiculous and unfounded claim.

pomt-00446	"Ashley Moody was a lifelong Democrat." ​	false	/florida/statements/2018/aug/21/frank-white/ashley-moody-republican-candidate-florida-ag-wasnt/	Once a Democrat, always a Democrat? That’s how a Republican candidate for Florida attorney general attacked his primary opponent in an ad weeks before the Aug. 28 primary. Frank White, a member of the Florida House since 2016, is challenging Ashley Moody, who was a Florida circuit court judge for 10 years before she resigned to run for attorney general. "Ashley Moody sued Donald Trump for fraud," said an ad from White, referencing when Moody was a plaintiff in a lawsuit concerning Trump’s involvement in the development of the unfinished Trump Tower Tampa. "Now she wants to be our Republican attorney general. How could we ever trust her?" Then the ad goes even further: "Ashley Moody was a lifelong Democrat." That would be an interesting development in a Republican primary, if it were true. But it is not. Moody was a registered Democrat for five years, but has been a registered Republican for the last 20. "Lifelong" ≠ 1993 to 1998 Under law, Florida voter registrations are public records and can be released to any person upon request. So we acquired Moody’s records from the supervisor of elections in Hillsborough County, where Moody currently lives, as well as elections supervisors in other counties where she had previously lived. We found that Moody first registered to vote in 1993, when she was 18. At that time, she registered as a Democrat in Hillsborough County. Moody later moved to Alachua County to attend the University of Florida. On Jan. 6, 1998, she updated her voter registration and switched her party affiliation to Republican. Moody then moved back to Hillsborough County and registered again to vote there in 2002. She then switched her registration so that she was registered in Duval County on June 30, 2004, said Katrell McKenzie of the Duval County Supervisor of Elections Office. In June 2006, Moody switched to being registered in Hillsborough County once more. She has been registered as a Republican in Hillsborough since 2006. So Moody was a registered Democrat for five years, but for the last 20 years, she’s been a registered Republican. Asked how this qualifies Moody as a "lifelong Democrat," a spokeswoman for Frank’s campaign gave an interesting response. Erin Isaac pointed out that "the ad does not say she IS a lifelong Dem." "Ashley Moody WAS a lifelong Democrat. Moody first registered as a Democrat and maintained that registration continually before reregistering, by continuing to act like a liberal. So she was a lifelong Democrat before she switched and continued liberal actions," Isaac explained. But most viewers of the ad aren’t paying attention to the small detail of whether White decided to call Moody a "lifelong Democrat" in the past or present tense. The Moody campaign website points out that Moody is not the only Republican politician to have started out by registering as a Democrat. President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi (who has endorsed Moody in the race) were all previously registered Democrats. (Pence, regarded as a stalwart Republican who hosted a conservative talk radio show, was a youth coordinator for his county’s Democratic Party.) Our ruling White claimed Moody "was a lifelong Democrat." Voter registration records show Moody did register as a Democrat in 1993, when she was 18. But she switched her party affiliation in 1998 to Republican, and has remained registered as a Republican ever since then. We rate this claim False.

pomt-14739	The 9/11 terrorists' friends, family, girlfriends in the United States "were sent back for the most part to Saudi Arabia. They knew what was going on. They went home, and they wanted to watch their boyfriends on television."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/17/donald-trump/trump-repeats-flights-home-911-hijackers-wives-gir/	In the confrontation with ISIS, Donald Trump has staked out perhaps the hardest of the hard lines among the Republican presidential field. He has called for blocking virtually all non-American Muslims from entering the country. He said America should "take out" the families of terrorists. During the Republican debate in Las Vegas on CNN, the moderator used a question from the public to press Trump on this policy. "How would intentionally killing innocent civilians set us apart from ISIS?" asked Josh Jacob from Georgia Tech. Trump did not repeat his call to "take out" family members but insisted the country has to be much tougher on family members because of what they know. "When you had the World Trade Center go, people were put into planes that were friends, family, girlfriends, and they were put into planes and they were sent back, for the most part, to Saudi Arabia," Trump said. "They knew what was going on. They went home and they wanted to watch their boyfriends on television." We reached out to the Trump campaign about the 9/11 terrorists’ close friends and family members leaving before the attacks and did not hear back. Trump has said this before, sometimes saying specifically that they were sent home a few days before the attack. He told Fox News' Bill O'Reilly "They take the wives, they put ‘em on planes, they send ‘em home. ‘Let’s go home and let’s watch Daddy tonight on television knock down the World Trade Center.' " In North Carolina, Trump told his supporters "the people, the animals that did that, they sent their wives and their families back to Saudi Arabia. Most of them went back to Saudi Arabia. Those wives knew what their husbands were going to do." The statement lacks any support. The 9/11 hijackers Trump needs two pieces to back up his statement. First, at least some of the hijackers needed to be married or have a girlfriend, and second, those people, or some family member, needed to be in the United States. According to the 9/11 Commission report, not a single hijacker had a wife, girlfriend or family member in the country in the days and months before the terrorists executed their plan. Only two of the 19 hijackers were married and only one had a girlfriend. Ziad Jarrah had a girlfriend in Germany, and hijackers Marwan al-Shehhi and Abdul Aziz al-Omari were married. Philip D. Zelikow, executive director of the 9/11 Commission, told us that while the commision didn't learn the exact whereabouts of the wives, whether in Saudi Arabia, Yemen or elsewhere in the Middle East, one thing is certain. "They sure weren’t living in the United States," Zelikow said. If no one was in America, there could be no flying home to "watch their boyfriends on television." The commission found no evidence that any of these women knew about the plot in advance. The commission reported that most of the terrorists had "broken off regular contact with their families." The one clear exception was Jarrah, who traveled to Lebanon to see his father and vacationed with his girlfriend in Florida about eight months before the attack. Jarrah called her in Germany shortly before he boarded United Airlines flight 93, the plane that crashed in rural Pennsylvania. Jarrah’s girlfriend was extensively interviewed by investigators who concluded she knew nothing. To be complete, we turn to one episode that could be linked to Trump’s statement. Bin Laden family members Trump’s words might reflect some confusion with the hastily organized departures of members of Osama bin Laden’s extended family -- not any wives or girlfriends of bin Laden himself -- a few days after the attack. Most of the bin Laden relatives were in high school or college in the United States. In an interview with the New York Times, Saudi Ambassador Bandar bin Sultan said that with the help of the FBI, his government arranged for these people to assemble in Washington where a chartered plane would take them back to Saudi Arabia. Bin Laden is one of 52 children of a man who built enormous wealth building roads and palaces. That gave him a large extended and affluent family. The 9/11 Commission report said that the FBI dug into the backgrounds of every Saudi national who flew home soon after the attacks. "They concluded that none of the passengers was connected to the 9/11 attacks and have since found no evidence to change that conclusion," the report said. "Our own independent review of the Saudi national involved confirms that no one with known links to terrorism departed on these flights." Our ruling Trump said that people close to the 9/11 hijackers -- friends, wives and girlfriends -- had knowledge of the pending attacks and were flown back to the Middle East so that they could "watch their boyfriends on television." Trump provided no evidence. The 9/11 Commission investigation found that 13 of the 19 attackers were unmarried. Only two had wives, a third had a girlfriend, and none of those women were in the United States immediately before the attack. The commission further found evidence that the hijackers had cut ties with their families. There is no substance behind the statement. We rate this claim False.

pomt-13706	"The Koch network (is) spending more money (in a Senate race) in Ohio than anywhere else in the country."	true	/ohio/statements/2016/jul/28/sherrod-brown/are-koch-backed-groups-spending-most-ohio-senate-r/	Voters in Ohio are enduring a deluge of fundraising emails from political groups ahead of the November election, like one from Friends of Sherrod Brown. The senator, in the middle of his second term, is hoping to garner support for fellow Democrat Ted Strickland. "Outside special interests like to spend money in Ohio," Brown’s email said. "Back in 2012, they spent $40 million trying to buy my seat in the Senate. … Right now, the special interests are up to $30 million spent against Ted -- with the Koch network spending more money in Ohio than anywhere else in the country." Strickland, the former Ohio governor, is running for Senate against incumbent Republican Sen. Rob Portman in one of the tightest races in the country. The billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, of Koch Industries, are tied as the sixth-richest people in the world, each worth an estimated $42 billion. As political and policy influencers advancing a free-market agenda, their network includes the nonprofit Americans for Prosperity and the super PAC, Freedom Partners Action Fund The Kochs can usually be counted on to fund conservative causes, but they have recoiled from the 2016 presidential race. Is down-ballot spending in Ohio the Koch’s biggest imprint so far in the 2016 elections? We turned first to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics for its tallies of outside contributions. The Koch brothers, through their political action network, have spent approximately $8 million in the senate race in Ohio, with almost $2 million from Americans for Prosperity and a little over $6 million from Freedom Partners Action Fund. That is more than the Koch-backed groups have spent in any other race in the country, according to OpenSecrets records. The Koch network’s next-largest spending, by comparison, is in North Carolina, where Americans for Prosperity has spent a mere $200,000 against Rep. Renee Ellmers, and in Pennsylvania, where Freedom Partners Action Fund has spent almost $3 million in opposition to Katie McGinty. In opposition spending by Freedom Partners, Strickland has "taken the most punishment" in 2016 to date, the Center for Responsive Politics reported. So the Koch network is contributing substantially to help Portman keep his seat. But where did Brown get the "$30 million spent against Ted"? Here are the numbers for outside spending contributions in the Ohio senate race, according to OpenSecrets.org: If you add the total outside spending for Portman, and the spending against Strickland, you get $19,232,784. (We’re leaving out the primary race spending for the other Democratic candidate, P.G. Sittenfeld, who Strickland beat -- that’s the difference between our total and the $19,990,270 above.) Where does the other $10 million come from? Strickland spokesman David Bergstein told PolitiFact Ohio that, in tracking money spent against the candidate, the campaign monitors announcements of advertising purchases, some of which come from 501(c)(4) organizations that don’t have to report to the Federal Election Commission. Those dollars, therefore, don’t appear on sites like OpenSecrets.org. Counting announcements of spending from these nonprofits, the conservative estimate is closer to $30 million, the campaign said. Bergstein provided a spreadsheet confirming that figure. Strickland’s campaign isn’t suffering from a lack of outside spending as much as Brown’s email might suggest. Senate Majority PAC, a super PAC dedicated to putting Democrats in Senate seats, has spent $8.4 million against Portman and $1.8 million for Strickland. We shared our analysis with Freedom Partners Action PAC, and the group did not dispute our findings. Our ruling A fundraising email in support of Strickland said that the billionaire-backed Koch network has devoted the most money to oppose the Ohio senate candidate than in any other race in the country. Americans for Prosperity and the Freedom Partners Action Fund have spent about $8 million to oppose Strickland, which is more than they’ve dropped in any other race this election season to date. Strickland’s campaign, while hardly immune to special interests, is the Koch network’s biggest target in an election year that has seen conservative benefactors steer clear of the main ticket.

pomt-13966	"Only half of the murders in the city of St. Louis get solved."	true	/missouri/statements/2016/jun/14/catherine-hanaway/hanaway-right-about-how-many-murder-get-solved-st-/	Missouri gubernatorial candidate Catherine Hanaway -- eager to showcase her law enforcement chops and touch on the trust issues of police simmering in the wake of Ferguson -- presented what she called a shocking statistic at a recent GOP governor’s debate. Hanaway, who was the U.S. attorney for the eastern district of Missouri from 2005 to 2009, discussed restoring trust between police and the communities and addressed crime during a governor’s debate June 6. "I was shocked when I became U.S. attorney to learn that only half of the murders in the city of St. Louis get solved," Hanaway said. Is that true? Hanaway’s policy director, Will Scharf, told us that Hanaway was speaking from "personal recollection." But FBI Uniformed Crime Report data largely supports Hanaway’s claim. We sorted the data using the Murder Accountability Project, which mines the FBI data. The most recent data is from 2014. There were 1,470 homicides reported in St. Louis from 2004-14. Of those, 795 were "cleared." A cleared offense occurs when at least one person is "arrested, charged with commission the arrest, and turned over to the court for prosecution (whether following arrest, court summons, or police notice)," according to the FBI’s website. All three of those requirements must be met for an offense to be considered cleared. Basically, a little over 54 percent of homicides were "cleared" in St. Louis between 2004 and 2014. That’s in line with what Hanaway said. We'll note two caveats. First, there is a technical difference between homicide and murder. James Alan Fox, a professor of criminology at Northeastern University said that murder is more restrictive term, and homicide includes any killing of a person, even an execution by the state. With murder, there is intent to cause bodily harm, however he said the terms are used interchangeably. Taking this into account, the number Hanaway is touting may be a little different from the data, but David Kennedy, director of the National Network for Safe Communities at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said using the word murder in place of homicide is "completely mainstream." "These terms are used so interchangeably that often the formal authorities don’t even make the distinction." Kennedy said. Second, Kennedy also said the rate of unsolved criminal homicides is "shockingly high" in many cities, so the situation in St. Louis is not all that unique. Our ruling Hanaway said "only half of the murders in the city of St. Louis get solved." That’s basically accurate looking at FBI data from 2004-14. We rate this claim True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f5682c82-966a-4646-90d4-df304162a1ac	None	Catherine Hanaway	None	None	None	2016-06-14T16:05:57	2016-06-06	['St._Louis']
pomt-09287	Links jailed lobbyist Jack Abramoff to Rep. C.W. Bill Young.	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2010/apr/26/charlie-justice/bill-young-jack-abramoff-charlie-justice/	In a new web ad, state Sen. Charlie Justice comes armed with ominous music and some sloppy Photoshop work to link opponent Rep. Bill Young with jailed lobbyist Jack Abramoff. But does Justice, who is seeking to unseat the 20-term Pinellas County Republican, have any facts? The ad describes "Abramoff, Inc." versus "Young, Inc.," and spends two minutes drawing parallels between Young and the disgraced lobbyist now serving almost six years in prison on charges of tax evasion, mail fraud, and conspiracy to corrupt public officials. The video uses Abramoff's famous fedora as a metaphor for the ties between the two men. A copy of the hat flips off Abramoff's head and lands on Young's. Words on the screen says that Abramoff "used his money for, among other things, luxury cars." The hat lands on Young as the screen says, "Bill Young uses his campaign money for, among other things, a luxury car" appears shortly thereafter. The ad says Abramoff was convicted of defrauding clients of "tens of millions of dollars," while Young "just this year" put earmarks in the federal budget totaling $128 million. Separately, we've rated two of the ad's claims -- about Young's use of a luxury car, and whether he accepted $737,000 "from lobbyists and recipients of his earmarks." In this item we wanted to zero in on the linkage between Young and Abramoff. Several other lawmakers, including former U.S. Rep. Tom Feeney of Florida, got tangled in the Abramoff scandal in one way or another. But there's never been a solid link to Young that we were aware of. We checked Nexis, a pay service that aggregates news articles from across the country, and found a few stories from 2006 did mention the two together -- all centering around $1,000 Young received in 2002 from an Abramoff client, the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians. But there is nothing to directly links Abramoff and Young. Indeed, Think Progress, a website run by the liberal Center for American Progress Action Fund has a section on Abramoff's links to Congress. Many members were mentioned, including Alaska Rep. Don Young (no relation), but Florida's C.W. Bill Young isn't discussed at all. We also checked Abramoff's federal charging document. Young isn't mentioned. The document does refer to an anonymous "Representative #1" but that turned out to be former Ohio Congressman Bob Ney, who resigned from office and pleaded guilty to corruption charges as part of the Abramoff imbroglio. "Mr. Young never met him," Young spokesman Harry Glenn told PolitiFact Florida. "He wouldn't be able to pick him out if the two passed on the sidewalk. To try to link them is ridiculous." We find that Justice's claim about Abramoff is an attempt at sleight of hand. The ad doesn't say Abramoff bought Young the car, but with its ominous music and flying hat, it suggests a connection when there isn't one. The only connection is a tenuous one, that one of Abramoff's clients contributed $1,000 to Young in 2002. There's no evidence that Abramoff himself contributed to Young, nor that Young ever sought earmarks for Abramoff, nor that they even actually met. That's not enough to hang a hat -- or a fedora -- on. Pants on Fire!	None	Charlie Justice	None	None	None	2010-04-26T18:42:45	2010-04-14	['Jack_Abramoff']
pomt-14973	"Republican leadership took the lead confirming Loretta Lynch as attorney general."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/18/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-gop-leadership-took-lead-confirming-/	Since his election to the U.S. Senate in 2012, Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has been a thorn in the side of fellow Republicans in the chamber for his no-compromise positions on key votes. On the Oct. 18, 2015, edition of NBC’s Meet the Press, Cruz, who's running for president, defended his approach to host Chuck Todd. "What the Republican majorities have done -- we came back right after the last election, passed a trillion-dollar ‘cromnibus’ bill filled with corporate welfare," he said. "Republican leadership joined with (Senate Democratic leader) Harry Reid and the Democrats to do that. Then (the Republican) leadership voted to fund Obamacare. Then they voted to fund amnesty. Then they voted to fund Planned Parenthood. And then Republican leadership took the lead confirming Loretta Lynch as attorney general. Now Chuck, which one of those decisions is one iota different than what would happened under Harry Reid and the Democrats? ... They've passed more Democratic priorities than Harry Reid ever could." We decided to take a closer look at one of the claims Cruz made -- that the "Republican leadership took the lead confirming Loretta Lynch as attorney general." Lynch -- the designated successor to President Barack Obama’s first attorney general, Eric Holder -- was confirmed by the Senate on a 56-43 vote on April 23, 2015. Before she was elevated to the post, Cruz made his opposition clear, urging his colleagues to block her confirmation unless Obama reversed his decision to defer deportation for certain undocumented immigrants, an executive action Obama had implemented over the criticism of many Republicans in Congress. Cruz’s main point, which he made to the media at the time, was that the Republican leadership was supporting Lynch’s nomination by simply putting the confirmation vote on the calendar -- which was its responsibility given that the GOP had won back control of the chamber during the 2014 midterm elections. Phil Novack, a spokesman for Cruz, said that because Republicans controlled the Senate during Loretta Lynch's confirmation hearings, GOP leaders had the power to stop her from becoming attorney general but did not do so. He pointed to a Politico op-ed during the confirmation fight in which Cruz wrote, "Senate Republicans have the power to stop this nomination. And we have a choice. We can honor our oaths to the Constitution—we can defend liberty and the rule of law—or we can confirm an attorney general who has candidly admitted she will impose no limits on the President whatsoever." What Cruz left out is that because of the efforts of GOP leaders Lynch’s path to confirmation was, by the standards of recent attorney general nominees, long and torturous. As Lynch was waiting to be confirmed, Democrats complained that the GOP majority was letting her nomination lag for a historically long time. When Obama, a few days before Lynch was finally confirmed, said that her nomination had been "sitting there longer than the previous seven attorney general nominees combined," we rated that Mostly True. From Nov. 13, when Lynch was first nominated, until her confirmation, she saw her appointment stuck in limbo for 161 days. By comparison, the longest confirmation wait for an attorney general nominee going back to Ronald Reagan’s presidency was 30 days. The shortest was just three days. While some members of the Senate Republican Conference, including Cruz, expressed concern about Lynch’s policy views, the direct reason for Lynch’s delay was that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., insisted on passing a pending human-trafficking bill before taking up Lynch’s nomination. On the whole, the anti-trafficking bill was uncontroversial, but it had become a bone of contention between the parties due to a battle over some of its language about abortion. After weeks of stalemate, senators reached a compromise on the abortion issue and, on April 22, passed the measure by a 99-0 vote. That cleared the way for the chamber to take up Lynch’s nomination. After senators passed a procedural vote by a 66-34 margin, they took up the nomination itself and it passed, 56-43. Ten Republican senators voted in favor of Lynch’s confirmation -- Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Orrin Hatch of Utah, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Susan Collins of Maine, Jeff Flake of Arizona, Mark Kirk of Ililnois, Rob Portman of Ohio, Thad Cochran of Mississippi, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin -- and McConnell. Senate experts said this chain of events falls well short of GOP leaders "taking the lead" to confirm Lynch. "McConnell acted like a conservative leader of a fairly conservative party in the Senate, getting as much as he could before grudgingly allowing the nomination to go forward," said Burdett Loomis, a University of Kansas political scientist and longtime Senate observer. Steven S. Smith, a political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis and a Senate specialist, agreed that Cruz’s claim is problematic. "It was Democrats who demanded action on the the Lynch nomination, not McConnell," Smith said. "McConnell removed obstacles to the consideration of the nomination, but that is far from taking the lead or championing the effort to confirm Lynch." A postscript: After voting against proceeding to the nomination in the preliminary vote, Cruz became the only senator who wasn’t present for the official confirmation, reportedly because he was traveling back to Texas for a fundraiser for his presidential campaign. "The cloture vote was the vote that mattered, I voted ‘no,’ and she was confirmed because Republican leadership chose to confirm her," Cruz told reporters at the time. "I disagree with that decision." Our ruling Cruz said the Senate’s "Republican leadership took the lead confirming Loretta Lynch as attorney general." As the leadership of the majority party in the Senate, McConnell and his lieutenants had the obligation of having the chamber hold a vote on Lynch’s nomination, and McConnell, along with several other Republicans, did personally vote for Lynch’s confirmation. However, Cruz’s claim glosses over the fact that Democrats were the driving force in pushing for a confirmation vote, and that McConnell delayed the nomination for longer than any similar nominee in recent history. This contrasts sharply with the impression Cruz leaves -- that GOP leaders were gung-ho about getting Lynch into office expeditiously. The claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False. UPDATE, Oct. 19, 2015: After we published this story, Cruz’s staff responded to our inquiry. Their comments have been incorporated into the article.

pomt-11463	"Democrats are nowhere to be found on DACA."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/07/donald-trump/are-democrats-nowhere-be-found-daca-donald-trump-c/	A deadline imposed by President Donald Trump for a legislative solution for so-called Dreamers has come and gone, yielding no solution. Trump blames Democrats, saying they have been absent from and uninterested in a deal. "It’s March 5th and the Democrats are nowhere to be found on DACA," Trump tweeted March 5. "Gave them 6 months, they just don’t care. Where are they? We are ready to make a deal!" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The Trump administration in September began phasing out Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. That’s the Obama-era program that protected from deportation immigrants in the country illegally who arrived when they were children, often called Dreamers. On March 5, a federal judge in Maryland said the Trump administration had the authority to rescind DACA. In a separate case, a federal judge in California in January ordered the administration to resume accepting DACA renewal applications and to keep the program on the same terms and conditions in effect, pending a final court judgment. The question in this fact-check is have Democrats been on the sidelines, as Trump claimed? We found Trump’s tweet ignores Democratic and bipartisan efforts to find a solution. And it also downplays the president’s own posturing that has impeded a deal. The White House did not provide an on-the-record response to our queries. Efforts to advance legislation for Dreamers Meetings with Trump: Trump and several lawmakers, including Democrats, met Jan. 9 to discuss a permanent law to benefit Dreamers, funding for the border wall and additional changes to the country’s legal immigration system. In the televised meeting, Trump expressed a willingness to work with Democrats and even to help the broader population of millions of immigrants in the country illegally. "What about a clean DACA bill now, with a commitment that we go into a comprehensive immigration reform procedure?" Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., asked Trump, since there is broad support for DACA but not for other immigration measures. "I would like to do that. Go ahead. I think a lot of people would like to see that, but I think we have to do DACA first," Trump said. Republican lawmakers, however, rejected that idea, saying border security had to be part of the deal and not come at a later date. Toward the end of the meeting, Trump said he’d rely on the people at the meeting and approve their future proposal. "I have a lot of respect for the people on both sides. What I approve is going to be very much reliant on what the people in this room come to me with," Trump said. "I have great confidence in the people. If they come to me with things that I'm not in love with, I'm going to do it because I respect them." Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and other Republican lawmakers met again with Trump on Jan. 11 to continue DACA talks. But negotiations took a step back after reports that Trump used disparaging language to describe some countries. Durbin told reporters that Trump "said things that were hate-filled, vile, and racist." Trump tweeted that Durbin "totally misrepresented what was said at the DACA meeting" and that "Durbin blew DACA." Legislative attempts: The Congressional Hispanic Caucus on Feb. 28 sent a letter to Trump listing several bipartisan bills they said Trump has rejected. "You have thwarted every bipartisan, narrow agreement that seeks to provide relief to Dreamers and instead have attempted to force a deeply unpopular, anti-immigrant agenda through Congress," the letter said. "We cannot expect Congress to make any headway on protecting Dreamers until the White House and Republicans, who control every branch of government, choose to work with Democrats on a bipartisan DACA fix." Two Senate bills dealing with Dreamers failed to get 60 votes. Both proposals included Democratic support. One proposal was sponsored by Sens. Chris Coons, D-Del., and John McCain, R-Ariz., the other by Sens. Mike Rounds, R-N.D., and Angus King, I-Maine, (most Democrats voted for it). The Trump administration opposed both proposals. On Jan. 11, a group of six senators — three Republicans and three Democrats — said they had reached a bipartisan agreement on immigration that addressed border security, the diversity visa lottery, "chain migration" and Dreamers. Trump also opposed that deal. "The so-called bipartisan DACA deal presented yesterday to myself and a group of Republican Senators and Congressmen was a big step backwards. Wall was not properly funded, Chain & Lottery were made worse and USA would be forced to take large numbers of people from high crime....." Trump tweeted Jan. 12. A proposal from Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, supported by Trump, was the least popular of four proposals voted on in mid-February, failing 39-60. Bipartisan groups of House lawmakers have also looked at ways to help Dreamers, including the Uniting and Securing America (USA) Act introduced in January and referred to a subcommittee. A tweeting contradiction Despite repeated Twitter claims that Democrats are absent from efforts to help Dreamers, Trump has also acknowledged their involvement. "While the Republicans and Democrats in Congress are working hard to come up with a solution to DACA, they should be strongly considering a system of Merit Based Immigration so that we will have the people ready, willing and able to help all of those companies moving into the USA!" Trump tweeted Feb. 15. The next day, he tweeted that it was only Republicans working and that Democrats had abandoned DACA recipients. Democrats willing to discuss border wall Willing to compromise on the wall: A major sticking point in the debates has been Trump’s demand for a border wall in exchange for a DACA deal. Some Democrats, in order to get a DACA deal, said they would discuss the border wall. "The Democrats have been told, and fully understand, that there can be no DACA without the desperately needed WALL at the Southern Border and an END to the horrible Chain Migration & ridiculous Lottery System of Immigration etc. We must protect our Country at all cost!" Trump tweeted Dec. 29. On Jan. 23, he tweeted again that "if there is no Wall, there is no DACA." Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., in January said he had "reluctantly put the border wall on the table for discussion" in exchange for strong DACA protections, but later rescinded that offer. Also in January, Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., said that while the border wall was "a monumental waste of taxpayers’ money," he would be in favor of it if that’s what it took to help Dreamers. Action or politics? January government shutdown: In January, Senate Democrats demanded a solution for the Dreamers in exchange for their votes on a bill that would keep the government running. When the Senate took up a House measure that excluded a deal for Dreamers, many Democrats rejected it. With a failed bill, the government on Jan. 20 entered its first shutdown since 2013. (Democrats received criticism for supporting a previous short-term spending bill in December that did not address Dreamers.) As the January shutdown loomed, Trump bashed Democrats for withholding votes because of DACA. "Sadly, Democrats want to stop paying our troops and government workers in order to give a sweetheart deal, not a fair deal, for DACA. Take care of our Military, and our Country, FIRST!" Trump tweeted Jan. 12. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s hours-long speech: Pelosi spoke for more than eight hours on the House Floor on Feb. 7, sharing stories about Dreamers and demanding a Republican commitment to vote on an immigration bill. Pelosi’s hours-long speech came as Republicans sought to pass another short-term government funding bill, opposed by Pelosi because it did not include protections for Dreamers. Congress eventually passed a budget deal after a few hours of a government shutdown. "Costs on non-military lines will never come down if we do not elect more Republicans in the 2018 Election, and beyond. This Bill is a BIG VICTORY for our Military, but much waste in order to get Dem votes. Fortunately, DACA not included in this Bill, negotiations to start now!" Trump tweeted on Feb. 9. Our ruling Trump tweeted, "Democrats are nowhere to be found on DACA." This fact-check isn't about assigning blame to a political party for the lack of a DACA deal. In reality, both political parties likely bear some responsibility. But Trump underplays and ignores the efforts of Democrats to reach a solution to help Dreamers, including meetings with Trump, bipartisan proposals, and a stated willingness to discuss border wall funding.

pomt-06617	"[The state ethics commission] took absolutely the same percent of cuts as most other state agencies. … They were somewhere in the 7 percent range – same as the governor’s office."	true	/georgia/statements/2011/sep/21/nathan-deal/ethics-budget-cuts-par-deals-office/	Political observers were transfixed this summer by the soap opera playing in the offices of the Georgia Government Transparency and Campaign Finance Commission. The body also known as the state ethics commission was rocked when commission executive secretary Stacey Kalberman, and her deputy, Sherilyn Streicker, announced in June their departures from the agency. The reasons behind their exits were tied up with the drama over a politically charged investigation into the election campaign of Gov. Nathan Deal. Kalberman claimed orders to eliminate Streicker’s position and cut her own $125,000 salary by a third were politically motivated, while commission Chairman Patrick Millsaps and other commission members said cuts to the commission’s budget meant it could no longer afford the executives’ salaries. The salary talks came as Kalberman was preparing to serve subpoenas on the governor, his chief of staff and associates for campaign spending documents as part of an ethics investigation. The subpoenas never were served, and the commission has asked Deal’s lawyer to voluntarily turn the papers over. Some have said the General Assembly’s slashing of the commission budget has weakened its ability to investigate irregularities. But when Deal was asked about it in a Q&A in the current edition of Georgia Trend magazine, he said the commission was not cut more than any other part of state government, including his own office. "They took absolutely the same percent of cuts as most other state agencies," he said. "When you’re making up a $1.4 billion [deficit], we had to continue to cut. They were somewhere in the 7 percent range – same as the governor’s office." Deal is the right man to talk to about the state budget since the General Assembly largely followed his blueprint to craft the $18.3 billion spending plan for the new state fiscal year, which began July 1. Did he get it right? Long story short, the answer is yes. But it turns out that when dealing with the state budget, getting there isn’t half the fun. From the start, Brian Robinson laid the groundwork by saying his boss was speaking off the cuff. "What the governor knew was that he ordered the governor’s office to have as big a cut as any agency," he said. "Obviously, not all agencies or departments got cuts. Education, for example, got more money than before." With help from the state Office of Planning and Budget, we find there is some math to wade through before we get our answer. On July 1, the ethics commission started out with a budget of $1,084,145, compared with last year’s original allocation of $1,131,121. That’s actually a 4.2 percent cut. By comparison, the governor’s office began fiscal 2011 with $6,276,732 and started this year with $5,914,065. That’s a 5.8 percent cut, which would indicate the governor was more than right in that the governor’s office took an even larger percentage cut to its budget than the ethics commission. But inside every agency’s budget is what the budget office refers to as "adjustments." Adjustments are essentially pass-through funds given to pay for things such as health insurance and workers’ compensation and are not considered part of the agency’s operating budget. Take those adjustments out, and using the baseline of the original fiscal 2011 appropriation, the cut to the ethics commission’s new budget is 7.6 percent. And, using the same calculation, the cut to the governor’s office is 7.2 percent. Robinson said the budget numbers reflect a promise kept. "Facing a budget deficit, Gov. Deal led the way he promised Georgians he would. He cut spending," Robinson said. "He set the example by cutting the governor's office budget by 7 percent, as much as any state agency or department." The governor appoints three of the five board members to the ethics commission; the General Assembly appoints the other two. It was up to the commissioners to figure out how to spend their smaller budget. The contemplated cut to Kalberman’s salary and the elimination of Streicker’s position accomplished that. For sake of context, the ethics commission’s budget has been slashed 42 percent since fiscal 2008, but the new governor had no say in it until this year. While this likely does little to settle questions over the staffing changes at the ethics commission, it does verify Deal’s statement to Georgia Trend, which we rate True.

pomt-09990	"Some even advocate wiping out 401(k)s entirely and replacing them with government-run accounts."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/apr/13/john-boehner/boehner-says-some-want-scrap-401ks/	In a press release touting a Republican plan to help restore savings lost in the plummeting stock market, House Republican Leader John Boehner suggests some Democrats want to wipe out 401(k)s in favor of government-run retirement savings program. "Recent polling suggests that Americans’ concerns about their savings even trumps concerns about losing their jobs," Boehner said in a statement on March 24, 2009. "Unfortunately, Washington Democrats have done nothing to address this savings crisis. In fact, Washington is pursuing policies that are causing Americans’ savings to evaporate more quickly, and some even advocate wiping out 401(k)s entirely and replacing them with government-run accounts. That’s unacceptable and not the solution Americans need at a time when they want to rebuild their retirement, college, and personal savings." So who are the "some" advocating such a dramatic overhaul of the American retirement savings system? According to a spokesman for Boehner, he's referring to a professor who spoke before the House Education and Labor Committee on Oct. 7. In a presentation on "The Impact of the Financial Crisis on Workers' Retirement Security," Teresa Ghilarducci, a professor of economic policy at New York's New School for Social Research, said America's "30-year experiment with 401(k) accounts has failed." About half of workers will not have enough in retirement to replace 70 percent of their preretirement income, she said, which is largely caused by a "fundamentally flawed" 401(k) program that has little regulation. She recommended Congress end tax subsidies for 401(k) plans in favor of "guaranteed retirement accounts" into which workers would be required to contribute 5 percent of their pay. The government would guarantee a 3 percent inflation-indexed return. And Uncle Sam would contribute $600 per worker, every year to those accounts. Her idea doesn't have any significant support in Congress that we could find. About the closest to support that we heard was from George Miller, the California Democrat who chairs the committee. He is interested in some kind of major long-term reform to the retirement savings system, but has stopped short of calling for the elimination of the 401(k) system. Two months ago, his committee held a hearing on strengthening worker retirement security. In his opening statement, Miller said "the current economic crisis has exposed deep flaws in our nation's retirement system. For too many Americans, 401(k) plans have become little more than a high-stakes crapshoot," Miller said. Miller did not discuss any specific changes, but over the long term, he said, we "should ask ourselves whether our current system gives workers the ability to ensure a safe and secure retirement." He emphasized the need to preserve and strengthen 401(k)s but also said the Congress must consider additional retirement options. "In the short term, Congress must address ways to improve defined contribution plans," Miller said. "The 401(k) needs to be more transparent, fair, and operated on behalf of the account holder, not Wall Street firms. But, we must also ask the difficult questions about the state of our nation's retirement system as a whole and look to see whether we need to create a new leg of retirement security." The Wall Street Journal blasted Ghilarducci's plan in a Nov. 14, 2008, editorial and criticized Miller for even entertaining her ideas. Conservative blogs also criticized the possibility that 401(k) plans be replaced by a government-run savings plan. Miller fired back, accusing the Wall Street Journal of misrepresenting his efforts and "needlessly creating fear among Americans rightly worried about their retirement security." "I do not support 'abolishing' 401(k)s, moving these plans, or changing their tax status, plain and simple," said Miller. "The truth is that Democrats in Congress are working to preserve and strengthen 401(k)s." Still, Miller's use of the phrase "short term" in February "piqued the curiosity" of Ed Ferrigno, vice president of Washington affairs for the Profit Sharing/401k Council of America, an association that represents employers that sponsor 401(k) plans. "He (Miller) made it clear that his support of 401(k)s is qualified," Ferrigno said. "I don't know what to read into that. It certainly could create a foundation for a system to overtake 401(k) plans." But there's been no support in Congress or the White House for the kind of wholesale change that Boehner mentioned, according to Ferrigno and our review of legislation and statements. To the contrary, Democrats have spoken of protecting 401(k)s. In a speech on the economy at Georgetown University on April 14, President Barack Obama spoke of the need to enact rules to "protect typical American families when they buy a home, get a credit card or invest in a 401(k)." Yes, there are "some" in Washington who are tossing around the prospect of moving to a government-run system, and some of them may even want to scrap 401(k)s. But they are not elected officials and not in the Obama administration. Our problem with Boehner's statement is that it seems to suggest the idea has gained traction with Democratic lawmakers and administration officials. Use of the word "some" may provide Boehner some wiggle room here ? he could probably safely say that "some" people in Washington may be advocating darn near anything ? but the context suggests Democrats are behind it. We haven't found any, so Boehner's claim comes off sounding more like a scare tactic. And so we rate the statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04574	Says Obama adviser David Plouffe took "large piles of cash" from a joint venture partner of a company owned by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/25/secure-america-now/super-pac-claims-obama-adviser-took-money-company-/	There’s the guilt-by-association attack ad -- and then there’s the recent TV ad from Secure America Now, a super PAC that ties President Barack Obama to his adviser David Plouffe’s association with a company with ties to Iran. Got that? Over darkened photographs of Obama and Plouffe, a narrator intones: "Barack Obama's most trusted adviser, ‘whose desk is just steps from the Oval Office,’ took 'large piles of cash' from a joint venture partner with Irancell, described by the U.S. Government as ' "fully owned" by Iran's Revolutionary Guard.' He got 'very rich' off 'the only real asset he has: his influence in and access to the Obama White House.' If this is who Obama trusts, can you trust Obama?" We’ll leave the question of trust to you. But we figured we would get to the bottom of the ad’s central claim, whether Plouffe took money from a "joint venture partner" of an Iranian cellular company. ‘Large piles of cash’ Plouffe, who famously managed Obama's 2008 presidential campaign, gave paid speeches around the world before he joined the White House as a senior adviser after the 2010 midterm elections. Secure America Now is the political arm of a similarly named nonprofit that says it supports "policies that will protect our nation against terrorist infiltration, attack, and capitulation to our enemies." It has previously accused Obama of softness on Iran, a nation under U.S. sanctions for supporting terrorism and attempting to develop nuclear weapons. We reached out to the group, but didn’t hear back. But the ad itself cites sources. The text relies heavily on the words of Glenn Greenwald, a Guardian columnist who used to write for progressive news site Salon. Greenwald wrote in reaction to an Aug. 5, 2012, Washington Post story. The Post piece detailed how Plouffe’s 2011 financial disclosure showed he had been paid $100,000 by MTN Nigeria. The White House explained to the Post that Plouffe traveled to Lagos, Nigeria, for two speeches in December 2010, just before he joined the Obama administration as a senior adviser. The Nigerian cell phone service provider is part of South African conglomerate MTN Group, which also owns 49 percent of an Iranian subsidiary, MTN Irancell. The South African company offers cell service through subsidiaries in Africa and the Middle East. Greenwald argued the scandal of the speaking fees wasn’t that they were "tainted by virtue of a connection to the Evil Persian Regime," something that he found "frivolous and cynical, just part of the ongoing Washington fear-mongering orgy over Iran." Rather, he saw them as an example of utterly typical — though deplorable — Washington influence-peddling. "David Plouffe — who has spent his entire career working in Washington as a political operative — has become a very rich man by converting into large piles of cash the only real asset he has: his influence in and access to the Obama White House and the Democratic Party," he wrote. Sound familiar? We asked Greenwald whether he thought the ad accurately characterized his work. "I think the parts about Plouffe are completely accurate," he said. "I think $100,000 for a couple of short speeches is a ‘large pile of cash’ in anyone's eyes." But he told us he’s not an expert on the MTN Group "or what it and its subsidiaries are doing with Iran." (And, in fact, for that claim the ad relied on a different source.) Greenwald said he relied on the government sources quoted in the Post article. The Post reported that a Treasury undersecretary had told Turkish officials in 2006 that Irancell was "fully owned" by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. That wasn’t public knowledge until an infamous release of State Department cables by WikiLeaks in 2010-11. White House response White House spokesman Eric Schultz called the ad "a complete distortion of the facts." He argued, among other things: • Plouffe didn’t directly profit from a "joint venture partner" of an Iranian company, as the ad said, but from its Nigerian subsidiary. • It was misleading to say that the U.S. government described Irancell as "fully owned" by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps., because that detail was in an as-yet unreleased State Department cable. Meanwhile, prominent advocacy groups hadn’t directly taken up the issue of MTN Group’s involvement in Iran when Plouffe spoke. That started in 2012. It’s fair to note that the ad makes it sound as though Plouffe was paid by MTN Group, when he in fact spoke for MTN Nigeria. But about the Revolutionary Guard relationship, we wondered: What could Plouffe (or the lawyer he’s said to have consulted) have learned about MTN Nigeria and its parent company in 2010? Plenty, as it turns out. We spent a few minutes with subscription news database Nexis. Searching just for "MTN Group" for articles published before December 2010, we quickly found a description of the company that mentioned Iran in a November 2010 news release: Launched in 1994, the MTN Group is a multinational telecommunications group, operating in 21 countries in Africa, Asia and the Middle East. The MTN Group is listed on the JSE Securities Exchange in South Africa under the share code: MTN. As of 30 September 2010 , MTN recorded 134.4 million subscribers across its operations in Afghanistan, Benin, Botswana, Cameroon, Cote dIvoire, Cyprus, Ghana, Guinea Bissau, Guinea Republic, Iran, Liberia, Nigeria, Republic of Congo (Congo Brazzaville), Rwanda, South Africa, Sudan, Swaziland, Syria, Uganda, Yemen and Zambia. With the same search, we turned up a Business Process Management Journal article describing MTN Irancell’s ownership as "comprised of two shareholders who are the Iran Electronic Development Company (IEDC) and MTN International (Mauritius) Limited. IEDC currently has two key shareholders: Iran Electronic Industries, known as SAIRAN and Mostazafan Foundation, known as Bonyad." If Plouffe or his lawyer had run those names through a publicly searchable Treasury database, they would have found that Iran Electronic Industries was under U.S. sanctions for being a proliferator of weapons of mass destruction, known for its role in Iran’s missile program. A Treasury news release in 2008 said it offered "a diversified range of military products including electro-optics and lasers, communication equipment, telecommunication security equipment, electronic warfare equipment, new and refurbished radar tubes, and missile launchers." So, an MTN Irancell investor had already been labeled — that’s right — a proliferator of weapons of mass destruction. The Iran connection in hand, a Google search turned up more, such as this 2008 New York Times article about MTN Group’s challenges with U.S. sanctions as it rapidly expanded its Iranian business. In other words, quick searches turned up red flags aplenty, well in advance of WikiLeaks’ release or advocacy groups’ publicity. We should note these are political, more than legal, red flags — transactions are prohibited between Americans and blocked companies, but Plouffe wouldn’t run afoul of the law taking money from a separate subsidiary of a company with an Iranian connection. But a political issue is precisely what this ad suggests. And even White House press briefings from the summer before Plouffe’s speeches would have tipped him off to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard’s use of front companies and expanding reach into Iran’s economy. As the administration announced new Iran sanctions in June 2010, undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence Stuart Levey noted the Iranian Revolutionary Guard had "taken over broad portions of the Iranian economy." Meanwhile, he expected Iran would "scramble to identify workarounds, hiding behind front companies, doctoring wire transfers, falsifying shipping documents." Our ruling Secure America Now’s ad claims that Plouffe took "large piles of cash" from a joint venture partner of a company owned by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard. In reality, he took $100,000 for two speeches from a Nigerian subsidiary of that "joint venture partner," and the Iranian company’s ownership wasn’t yet crystal clear. But there were plenty of red flags, if Plouffe had looked for them, that his speaking trip in retrospect might not look so politically savvy. For example, a key Irancell shareholder was already labeled a proliferator of weapons of mass destruction. We rate the ad’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-14533	North Korea’s missiles are "not going to have a capability to reach the United States anytime real soon."	true	/arizona/statements/2016/feb/16/john-mccain/could-north-korea-missile-strike-united-states/	North Korea’s Feb. 7 rocket launch scared some folks. Weapons experts saw it as a test for a potential missile strike on the United States. Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement that it threatened "not only the security of the Korean peninsula, but that of the region and the United States as well." However, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz, was more measured in his remarks on the rocket launch during the Fox News program Outnumbered on Feb. 8. "China controls North Korea’s destiny, we should have some sanctions against, not just North Korea, but Chinese that do business with North Korea. And by the way, they’re not going to have a capability to reach the United States anytime real soon, but it is inevitable over time they will," McCain said when asked about what the United States should do in response to the launch. We wondered just how close North Korea is to reaching the United States via missile, so we put McCain’s statement through a fact-check. The technology is there The day after McCain made his claim, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee. Clapper said North Korea is "committed to developing a long-range, nuclear-armed missile that is capable of posing a direct threat to the United States," but he also noted that the system has not been "flight-tested." A January 2016 Congressional Research Service report on U.S.-North Korea relations also stated that North Korea has the ability to put a nuclear weapon on their KN-08, an intercontinental ballistic missile, "and shoot it at the homeland." McCain press aide Julie Tarallo pointed us to this when we asked about his comments. However, the report also notes that until North Korea tests the device, its nuclear capabilities will "remain uncertain." Missile experts we spoke with held largely the same views. Melissa Hanham is a senior research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies who studies North Korean weapons. She agreed with McCain’s statement and said Americans shouldn’t be fearful because it takes North Korea days to prepare for a rocket launch. The estimated range of their rockets, at 10,000 km, puts Alaska, Hawaii and the western United States in range. But, they have never demonstrated all the capabilities needed to turn their present technology into a missile. "Regardless, they are working toward this goal, and unless there is some appropriate intervention, they will achieve it," Hanham said. Scott Snyder, a senior fellow for Korea Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, said McCain’s claim is "generally accurate." "The imminence of the North Korean threat has been hyped for a long time; that being said, one successful KN-08 test would revolutionize perceptions of North Korea’s capabilities," Snyder said. As far as a timeline, Jenny Town, assistant director of the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies, estimates that North Korea will not be able to reach the United States by missile until at least 2020 -- assuming a lack of intervention. Our ruling McCain said of North Korea’s missile program, "They’re not going to have a capability to reach the United States anytime real soon, but it is inevitable over time they will." His statement is a bit of a generalization, but he’s right. North Korea may have the missile technology -- and range -- to strike the United States, but it hasn’t been tested. Experts on missile technology agreed with McCain. We rate McCain’s claim as True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2016-02-16T11:14:22	2016-02-08	['United_States']
pomt-10932	"I don’t think it’s been proven that the game of football causes CTE."	half-true	/north-carolina/statements/2018/jul/26/larry-fedora/unc-football-coach-says-its-not-proven-football-ca/	Football is under attack. That’s what Larry Fedora, head coach of the UNC football team, told reporters during an ACC media event on July 18. Without naming anyone, Fedora said "people twist the data" on football-related injuries to argue that the game isn’t safe. Football is safer than it has ever been, he said, adding that reports of the game’s ties to head injuries are overblown. "I don’t think it’s been proven that the game of football causes CTE," Fedora said. CTE is short for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a progressive degenerative brain disease linked to head trauma. "Now we do know, from my understanding, that repeated blows to the head causes it," Fedora said. "So I’m assuming, every sport that you have, football included, could be a problem with that. As long as you’ve got any kind of contact, you can have that." Fedora is right about CTE being caused by blows to the head. But is he right that researchers haven’t "proven" that football causes CTE? Through a spokeswoman, he declined PolitiFact’s request to elaborate on his claim. But PolitiFact found that Fedora’s point is somewhat valid. Scientists have suspected a link between football and brain problems for decades. However, research into the whether the sport consistently causes CTE hasn’t gotten very far. 110 of 111 brains CTE cannot be diagnosed in someone until they die, so it’s impossible at this point for doctors and scientists to measure football’s effect on the human brain on a year-to-year basis. The most illuminating information emerged in 2017. That year, the Journal of the American Medical Association published the work of researchers who studied the brains of deceased football players who played at various levels, from high school to college to semi-pro and the NFL. In total, nearly 88 percent of the brains — 177 of 202 — submitted for the research tested positive for CTE. But the rate of CTE was lower in younger players. (NPR summarized the research.) ▪ Of the 14 players who played only in high school, just three had CTE. ▪ Of the 53 players who stopped playing after college, 48 had CTE. ▪ Of the 22 players who played in the Canadian Football League or a semi-pro league, 16 had CTE. ▪ Of the 111 players who played in the NFL, 110 had CTE. (An NFL player may have a higher risk of CTE if he began playing as a child. A separate study, published in 2014, found that former NFL players who started playing football before age 12 fared worse on cognitive assessments than players who started in their teens, as Vox explained this year.) Dr. Ann McKee, one of the researchers who conducted the 2017 study published in JAMA, said those results show a link between football and CTE. "We’re seeing this (CTE) in a very large number that participated in football for many years. So while we don’t know the exact risk and we don’t know the exact number, we know this is a problem in football," she told NPR. But each of the brains was donated, leaving some researchers divided on how to characterize football’s ties to CTE. Sampling bias Dr. Peter Cummings, forensic pathologist and a neuropathologist at Boston University School of Medicine, wrote in a 2017 Yahoo Sports column that McKee’s study doesn’t definitively prove a link between football and CTE. He noted the brains were donated by families who likely suspected the player had developed neurological problems. "Because of this sampling bias, we cannot estimate the prevalence or incidence of CTE (meaning the total number of cases and the number of new cases expected each year in football players); nor can we establish risk or a cause-effect relationship between head injury and development of CTE," Cummings wrote. "To do that you need a randomly selected population comprised of people with the disease and people without the disease," he said. "In other words, we do not have a complete picture of what causes CTE, how common CTE is, or what the chance of getting CTE may be for anyone, or even what symptoms, if any, CTE causes." Another recent Yahoo Sports column quotes Cummings defending Fedora, saying that "association is not causation." The same column refers to CTE researchers in Canada, who warn that the most commonly cited studies on the disease "do not allow for the collection of any epidemiological data and are not representative of the general population." The studies are "limited by methodological biases, pathological inconsistencies, insufficient clinical data, and a reliance on inherently biased postmortem data," their abstract says. The burden of proof Lewis Margolis, a pediatrician and epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina’s Gillings School of Global Public Health, said he generally agrees with Cummings and others that the scientific proof has yet to be determined. "Has there been a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial where some boys are exposed to brain trauma and other boys are not and then later examined for CTE? The answer is no," Margolis said in an email. "Such a trial would not be ethical." UNC has a research center dedicated to studying the link between contact sports and head injuries. Its research shows a clear relationship between football and brain trauma, Margolis said. "The implication of the statement by Fedora is that because we do not have the definitive (randomized controlled trial) for CTE we cannot say that football causes CTE. To me this misses that point that football increases the risk of head trauma/concussions with known consequences, even if there is not a definitive link (yet) to CTE," he said. Margolis has warned that players or parents who are waiting for definitive, scientific proof could be putting themselves or their kids at risk. "The tobacco industry used to say that the relationship between smoking and lung cancer was ‘merely’ a statistical association, similar to saying that there is not proof that football causes CTE," Margolis said. "The weight of the evidence against tobacco eventually tipped the scales, absent randomized trials, and I think the weight of the evidence of the harms of football is similar, even without a definitive link to CTE." NFL acknowledgment Back to Cummings and the lack of a valid scientific study proving that football causes CTE. The NFL, which has been accused of suppressing information about how the sport affects players’ long-term health, could use the same argument. And, for a while, it did. ("Frontline" in 2013 published a timeline showing key events and research dating back to 1994.) In 2013, while admitting no wrongdoing, the NFL reached a $765 million settlement with former players after 4,500 of them sued the NFL on the basis that the league minimized the risk of concussions. (Amid a challenge, the settlement was later upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court.) Then in March 2016, for the first time, the NFL publicly acknowledged a link between football and CTE. The statement came while Jeff Miller, the NFL’s senior vice president of health and safety policy, was part of a round-table discussion with the U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce. Miller pointed to McKee’s work as evidence. And the NFL released a statement the day after Miller’s claim, saying his comments "accurately reflect the view of the NFL." Our rating Fedora said it hasn’t been "proven that the game of football causes CTE." He’s right that there hasn’t been a controlled study showing, conclusively, that playing football directly causes CTE. However, studies have shown CTE in the brains of more than 100 former football players, and the NFL has acknowledged a link between football and CTE. There’s enough evidence to show a connection between football and CTE. We rate this claim Half True.	None	Larry Fedora	None	None	None	2018-07-26T14:56:44	2018-07-18	['None']
pomt-13970	On his support for Donald Trump.	half flip	/wisconsin/statements/2016/jun/14/scott-walker/scott-walkers-support-donald-trump-some-inconsiste/	On the same day chatter surfaced about how Scott Walker could still become the Republican presidential nominee, the Wisconsin governor made comments that raised questions about his support of the party’s presumptive nominee, Donald Trump. Walker’s comments on June 8, 2016 prompted headlines such as these: Politico: "Walker backs away from endorsing Trump" Wall Street Journal: "Scott Walker withholds Donald Trump endorsement" So, barely a month before the GOP nominates its candidate for president, has Walker changed his position on Trump? Cue the Flip-O-Meter, which determines whether a politician has changed positions on an issue. The backdrop Talk among Republicans about replacing Trump grew in the wake of racial remarks Trump made about a Hispanic federal judge in California who is handling two lawsuits filed in against Trump University. Yahoo reported that Walker "has been increasingly mentioned as a possible replacement." And the conservative website RedState said there were rumors of Walker being open to accepting the nomination at the convention. Walker dismissed the talk. But the new reports on Walker’s viability as a Trump replacement were fueled by Walker’s own comments the same day. So, let’s look at where Walker has been on Trump, starting with when Walker himself was still in the race. Walker’s early comments Walker launched his presidential bid in July 2015 and was quickly considered a frontrunner, even in the crowded GOP field. The next month, he was on stage with Trump and eight other hopefuls for the first GOP debate, held in Cleveland. The candidates were asked to raise their hand if they would not pledge to back the party's nominee and swear off an independent run. Trump was the only one to raise his hand. In other words, Walker pledged he would back the GOP nominee. Of course, at that stage, Walker himself hoped to be his party’s choice, and it would be months before Trump became the presumptive nominee. Walker ended his presidential bid in September 2015, amid campaign cash-flow problems and a drop in the polls, Ahead of Wisconsin’s primary in April 2016, Trump was harshly critical of Walker, who endorsed U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. Soon questions turned to whether Walker would back Trump. April 20, 2016: Walker told reporters: "I will support the Republican running against Hillary Clinton in the fall -- whoever that is." Asked if he would do so even if Trump were the nominee, he said: "Yeah. To me, I think it's preferable to have a Republican nominee over Hillary Clinton." May 4, 2016: Alluding to the first GOP debate, Walker told reporters the day after Cruz dropped out: "I stood on the stage in Cleveland and said that I would support the nominee. I’ve said it repeatedly since then and I’ll be supporting the Republican nominee once that’s officially set at the convention against Hillary Clinton." June 6, 2016: The Post-Crescent in Appleton reported that Walker said he would have no problem supporting Trump even though "he wasn't my first choice." He said in the interview: "There are issues, not the least of which lately with his statements about the judge he commented on, which I just fundamentally disagree with him on, so just saying that I'll support him over Hillary Clinton doesn't mean I embrace all the things that he says or all the ways that he says it." So, Walker initially declared he would support the Republican nominee. Then, months later, as it became clear that Trump was closing in on the nomination, Walker repeatedly said he would support Trump -- though on at least one occasion he said his support once the GOP nomination becomes "officially set." Now to the Walker comments that made national headlines. Walker’s latest comments June 7, 2016: The Wall Street Journal headline about Walker withholding a Trump endorsement was based on comments Walker made to reporters that were highlighted in a report by WKOW-TV in Madison. Walker denounced Trump’s comments about the judge and said he wanted Trump himself to renounce them, according to a reporter’s recording of Walker’s remarks. A reporter then asked: "Would that influence your decision at all on whether or not to back him as the nominee?" Walker said: "Again, we’ll watch and see what happens. We’ll be watching closely. There’s still quite some time until he’s even the nominee, so we’ll have to wait and see." Asked what would cause him not to support Trump, Walker said: "Well, again, he’s not yet the nominee. Officially that won't happen until the middle of July, and so for me that's kind of the time frame on that. In particular, I want to make sure that he renounces what he says -- at least in regards to this judge." Walker added: "I think for a lot of us, not just Republicans in general, we want to see what he’s going to do between now and the time the convention comes. The sad fact is -- it’s just sad in American that we have such poor choices right now." June 8, 2016: After another question-and-answer session with reporters, the Associated Press reported, that Walker was wavering in his support of Trump and that he dodged a question on the issue. Walker was asked, according to a reporter's recording of that exchange: "Do you still support him (Trump) as the nominee?" Walker began his response by saying: "Well, right now I'm focused on calling out, as I have the last couple days, the fact that I believe what he said about the judge is wrong -- not as a Republican, not as a political person, but I think it's just wrong as an American." Walker went on at some length criticizing Trump’s remarks, ending by saying: "He needs to make it abundantly clear to the American people that he does not embrace those ideas. And I think it’s particularly important between now and the convention that he does that." Our rating Dating back to August 2015, when he himself was a candidate for president, Walker said he would support the Republican presidential nominee. And several times over the next 10 months, Walker repeated that pledge -- including as it was becoming clear that Trump would be the presumptive nominee. But on two consecutive days in June 2016, Walker shifted somewhat. Questioned about Trump by reporters, Walker would not state his support as he had in the past. Instead, while criticizing Trump, he emphasized that Trump is not yet the nominee. Our definition of Half Flip is a partial change of position or inconsistent statements. That fits here.

pomt-02717	"The fact that one town has three lanes dedicated to it, that kind of gets me sauced."	pants on fire!	/new-jersey/statements/2013/dec/22/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-3-lanes-george-washington-br/	Hardly a day passes where vicious snarls don’t somehow tie up the George Washington Bridge. But those snarls aren’t limited to traffic. More and more, daily questions are arising from the September closure of some local-access lanes on the span. To date, they have resulted in the resignation of two high-ranking transportation officials and calls for a federal investigation into what’s become known as ‘Bridgegate.’ And none of the questions are going away quietly. Among the latest claims to enter the fray? One by Gov. Chris Christie, who complained earlier this month about the local-access lanes for Fort Lee, where the bridge is located. "The fact that one town has three lanes dedicated to it, that kind of gets me sauced," Christie said Dec. 2 in response to Democratic lawmakers subpoenaing the director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey -- which operates the bridge -- to appear before a state Assembly committee about the lane closures from Sept. 9-13. The closures caused massive traffic jams in Fort Lee, leaving some drivers stranded for hours. Three lanes of a 29-lane span (12 lanes on the upper level, 10 on the lower level and seven from the Palisades Parkway) dedicated to a relatively small borough in Bergen County? The governor isn't even close to correct. Let’s look at some numbers here. The 2012 census notes that Fort Lee’s land area is 2.54 square miles and the borough’s population that year was 35,732. And not all of those people are drivers or even users of the bridge connecting upper Manhattan with the borough. So why the hullabaloo about bridge lanes and Fort Lee? It goes to the September closures, when two of three local-access lanes were closed, purportedly for a traffic study, according to Port Authority officials questioned about the closures. Some Democrats have questioned whether the closures were political retribution against Fort Lee’s Democratic mayor for failing to endorse Republican Gov. Chris Christie for re-election last month.. And the matter has continued to heat up. Assemblyman John Wisniewski (D-Middlesex), chairman of the Assembly Transportation, Public Works and Independent Authorities Committee, and an outspoken critic of the Port Authority, has convened hearings on the matter and issued subpoenas to Port Authority officials to testify about what happened. David Wildstein, the Port Authority’s director of interstate capital projects, who ordered the bridge’s general manager to carry out the closures, and agency Executive Director Bill Baroni have since resigned. On Dec. 10 the Port Authority’s inspector general launched an investigation into the closures and now U.S. Sen. Jay Rockefeller, a West Virginia Democrat who chairs the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, has asked the federal transportation secretary to investigate. Both Wisniewski and Sen. Loretta Weinberg (D-Bergen) are dumbfounded by Christie’s claim that the local access lanes are dedicated to Fort Lee. "These lanes are open to the general public," Wisniewski said. "They’re physically located in Fort Lee but they’re not dedicated to Fort Lee. "I think it’s the word ‘dedicated’ to Fort Lee that creates the problem here," Wisniewski added. "There’s an access point at Fort Lee that people (who live there) use and that many other people use." Wisniewski explained that use of the access lanes in Fort Lee is similar to drivers using the New Jersey Turnpike Extension, for example, to get to the Holland Tunnel connecting Manhattan and Jersey City. It’s one way of using the tunnel, but not the only way. And Weinberg, who lives near the bridge, noted that there is no residency requirement for the people of Fort Lee or anyone else to use the bridge. "There are no specific dedicated lanes," she said. "There are lanes that come from local streets in Fort Lee, but all lanes come through Fort Lee because the bridge is there. There are some local streets where you don’t have to get on the main highway." Since neither Christie’s spokespeople, Port Authority spokespeople or even the Fort Lee Police Department would respond to requests for comment on the matter, the Truth-O-Meter went on the road last week to check out the local access lanes. We found that Wisniewski’s and Weinberg’s assessments are correct: there are lanes from local Fort Lee streets but none are dedicated specifically to the borough. Anyone can use them -- or not. Our ruling Earlier this month, in response to subpoenas being issued in the so-called ‘Bridgegate’ scandal, Christie said, "The fact that one town has three lanes dedicated to it, that kind of gets me sauced." Christie is way off here. Never mind that his claim makes it seem as if a significant part of the bridge’s total number of lanes are dedicated to a borough with a land area only 2.5 square miles in size, with approximately 35,000 residents. The facts are that the George Washington Bridge is physically in Fort Lee and there are local access lanes from the bridge. But none of the lanes are dedicated for use only in or by the borough. All motorists are able to use them as an entry point to the span. Know what gets the Truth-O-Meter sauced, governor? Ridiculously false claims. Pants on Fire! To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.

pomt-03566	The IRS is going to be "in charge" of "a huge national database" on health care that will include Americans’ "personal, intimate, most close-to-the-vest-secrets."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/may/20/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-decries-huge-national-database-ru/	During a recent interview with Fox News, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., raised the specter of the Internal Revenue Service -- an agency currently under fire for appearing to target conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status -- collecting a database full of "intimate" details about Americans. Referring to an inspector general’s report on IRS scrutiny of conservative groups, Bachmann said, "So now we find out these people are making decisions based on our politics and beliefs, and they're going to be in charge of our health care. There's a huge national database that's being created right now. Your health care, my health care, all the Fox viewers health care, their personal, intimate, most close to the vest secrets will be in that database, and the IRS is in charge of that database? So the IRS will have the ability potentially -- will they? -- to deny health care, to deny access, to delay health care? This is serious! Based upon our political beliefs? That's why we have to repeal Obamacare. And I still think it's possible." We’ve already rated two of her claims from this exchange, which came during a May 15, 2013, interview on the Fox News show On the Record with Greta Van Susteren. We gave Bachmann a False for saying that the IRS is "going to be in charge of our health care," and we gave her a Mostly False for her claim that "The IRS will have the ability potentially" to deny or delay health care. In this item, we’ll focus on whether it’s correct to say that the IRS is going to be in charge of "a huge national database" on health care that will include Americans’ "personal, intimate, most close-to-the-vest-secrets." After the interview with Van Susteren aired, Dan Kotman, a spokesman for Bachmann, told PolitiFact that she stands by her charge. As evidence, he cited a passage from a Wall Street Journal editorial published one day before her television appearance. The editorial described a Federal Data Services hub that is taking "the IRS's own records (for income and employment status) and centralizing them with information from Social Security (identity), Homeland Security (citizenship), Justice (criminal history), HHS (enrollment in entitlement programs and certain medical claims data) and state governments (residency). The data hub will be used as the verification system for ObamaCare's complex subsidy formula. ... "Good luck in advance to anyone who gets caught in this system's gears, assuming it even works. Centralizing so much personal information in one place is another invitation for the IRS wigglers in some regional office—or maybe higher up—to make political decisions about enforcement." We see four key questions for fact-checking Bachmann’s claim. First, is the government constructing a database? Second, will the IRS be "in charge" of it? Third, would it include "personal" or "intimate" details? And fourth, would it affect all, or most, Americans? We’ll take these issues in order. Is the government constructing a database? Not by the traditional definition of "database." The "hub" the government is creating is a mechanism for extracting data from a variety of databases that exist at other agencies. The hub doesn’t collect, centralize and store data; it is designed to allow real-time access to data that resides on the servers of other agencies in order to verify transactions related to the health insurance exchanges created under Obama’s law. In an April 22, 2013, release, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a part of HHS, said that it has completed the hub’s technical design and is in the midst of testing it. "The hub will not store consumer information, but will securely transmit data between state and federal systems to verify consumer application information," the center said in the statement. HHS pledges "strict privacy controls to safeguard personal information," added Brian Cook, a spokesman for the department. "This is not a huge national database of health records," said Deven McGraw, director of the health privacy project at the Center for Democracy and Technology, which advocates for Internet freedom. Will the IRS be "in charge" of the hub? No. It’s being built by HHS, specifically by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. To ensure compatibility, the IRS needs to cooperate with HHS on the effort, but the IRS has only a supporting role in building the system, and the IRS will not be able to use the hub to view information in the other agencies’ databases. Will the hub include "personal" or "intimate" details? The hub is not designed to access, much less store, information like body mass index, or whether you have a serious illness or ingrown toenails. The hub will be able to tell if someone has insurance or not, but it will not access records about their health. It could access other "personal" details beyond health status, including adjusted gross income and Social Security numbers, but those already exist in federal databases, so the hub wouldn’t represent an expansion of federal data collection. Would the hub affect all, or most Americans? No. The data won’t be accessed by the hub unless an individual logs on to the new insurance exchanges in order to purchase insurance. An estimated 28.6 million Americans might be eligible for health insurance subsidies on the exchange in 2014, though the Congressional Budget Office has suggested that many fewer Americans will actually sign up, at least at first -- 6 million in 2014 and 22 million in 2017. So the numbers of Americans who might eventually interact with the hub aren’t trivial -- but it’s important to note that even if everyone who’s eligible takes the opportunity to use the exchanges, they would represent a small fraction of all Americans. People who have employer-provided insurance or are on Medicare, Medicaid, veterans health care or most other forms of government-provided insurance should have no need to interact with the hub at all. Our ruling Bachmann said the IRS is going to be "in charge" of "a huge national database" on health care that will include Americans’ "personal, intimate, most close-to-the-vest-secrets." The congresswoman chooses to believe that the IRS and the rest of the government intend to delve ever-further into Americans’ personal lives. We can’t predict what will happen in the future, but as best we can tell now, she has mischaracterized the intent and limitations of the hub. It’s not a "database." The IRS isn’t running it. It won’t include "intimate" health data. And most Americans won’t need to interact with it at all. We rate her comment Pants on Fire.

pomt-01592	"We cut our deficits by more than half."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/sep/05/barack-obama/obama-says-he-has-cut-national-deficit-half/	In 2012, PolitiFact twice rated True claims that President Barack Obama failed to keep a promise to cut federal deficits in half by the end of his first term. At that point, the budget gap topped a trillion bucks and Republican congressmen called out Obama because the deficit had been reduced by just 15 percent. But there was the president at Laborfest 2014 in Milwaukee proclaiming "we cut our deficits by more than half." In his Sept. 1, 2014 speech, the president ticked off for union supporters a list of major policy decisions he contends helped boost the economy and improve the government’s bottom line. We can’t cover all of those here, but the deficit claim grabbed our attention. Has it really been cut in half? The White House Office of Management and Budget pointed us to a chart prepared by that office in 2013 as proof of Obama's claim. It compares the yearly deficits under Obama, expressed -- as they often are -- as a share of the nation’s entire economy, which is measured by the Gross Domestic Product. At the start of Obama’s term, the chart showed, the figure was 9.2 percent. The latest figure was 4.1 percent. That appears to back Obama's statement. But let's examine this in detail. To do that, we reviewed figures published by the Congressional Budget Office as well as the White House’s Office of Management and Budget. We also consulted with independent fiscal experts. The baseline year for comparison is fiscal year 2009, which ended Sept. 30 of that year. This was the last budget from President George W. Bush, as Obama took office in January of that year. The most recent complete fiscal year is 2013. Those are the same years Obama's chart showed. Our analysis showed the drop easily topped 50 percent, and was actually somewhat higher than Obama's chart would indicate. As a share of the economy, we found -- and our experts confirmed -- the drop was from 9.8 percent in 2009 to 4.1 percent in 2013. Obama’s chart actually reflects a lower deficit figure for 2009, and therefore a lower share of GDP, 9.2%. That’s because instead of using the actual 2009 deficit of $1.4 trillion, Obama lowers it by the $200 billion in increased deficit spending that he -- not Bush -- pushed through in the stimulus plan to address the crisis that became the Great Recession. That resulting figure is what Obama calls the deficit he "inherited" from Bush. But no matter which figure is used, the deficit as a share of the economy still fell by more than half. Show me the money There's another way to look at this. That is, in raw dollars -- the way attendees at the union event probably would. Indeed, deficits are often expressed that way as well. The White House and CBO figures each show that in 2009 the deficit reached $1.4 trillion. As a share of GDP, it easily topped any year since World War II, said Steve Ellis, vice president of the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense. By the end of fiscal year 2013, the deficit figure had fallen to $679.5 billion in dollars unadjusted for inflation. That’s a 52 percent drop. Here’s the year-by-year trend in 2009 dollars: Fiscal year Deficit Deficit as share of GDP 2009 1,412,688,000,000 9.8 percent 2010 1,294,373,000,000 8.8 percent 2011 1,299,593,000,000 8.4 percent 2012 1,086,963,000,000 6.8 percent 2013 679,502,000,000 4.1 percent There is one wrinkle. When you use Obama's methodology to compare the deficit Obama inherited -- the 2009 result minus the stimulus package to that in 2013 -- the drop in the deficit is slightly under half, at 48%. Ellis and Marc Goldwein, senior policy director at the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, both included an additional year, the 2014 fiscal year, which is just a month from completion. The Aug. 27, 2014 CBO estimate for this year’s budget, fiscal year 2014, is a continued shrinking of the deficit to $506 billion, or 2.9 percent of GDP. Those figures would put Obama's claim over the top no matter the number-crunching method. Looking ahead Ellis cautioned that talking about deficit amounts in raw dollars doesn’t really give a good sense of the scale: "A $400 billion deficit in a $10 trillion economy is a lot bigger than a $400 billion deficit in $17 trillion economy." And he and Goldwein emphasized that while the deficit has been halved, it’s been halved from a skyscraping peak. In the decade before deficits exploded in 2008 and 2009, they averaged just over 1 percent of GDP, including three years of surpluses, we calculated. As of 2013, that figure was at 4.1 percent. The growth in the deficit from 2007 to 2009 was due mainly to factors related to the Great Recession, said Goldwein. Tax collections fell as people lost jobs and corporate profits dropped; spending on food stamps and other aid programs rose with increased need; stimulus and tax break legislation passed, as did bailouts of financial firms. "The economic recovery, wind-down of stimulus, reversal of TARP/Fannie transactions, and lower interest rates are really what has caused our deficit to fall so much," Goldwein told us. He mentioned cuts in discretionary spending as well. Looking ahead, the CBO warns that later in the next decade deficits as a share of the economy will grow and federal debt will climb without changes in current policies. But Obama, it’s fair to say, was speaking of the change during his presidency. And his claim dovetails with one PolitiFact National checked in July 2013, rating True Obama’s claim that the deficit is falling at the fastest rate in 60 years. Our rating At a union rally on Labor Day, Obama declared "We cut our deficits by more than half." The numbers back up Obama’s claim: Thanks to income tax revenues rising and spending on emergency assistance dropping, America’s deficit has fallen by more than 50 percent from its highest point since World War II to a level $733 billion lower. We rate the claim True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2014-09-05T05:00:00	2014-09-01	['None']
pomt-04600	"I am going to be on the ballot in all 50 states. There is no other third-party candidate that’s going to come close to achieving that."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2012/sep/20/gary-johnson/libertarian-gary-johnson-says-hell-be-presidential/	Former two-term New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson, the Libertarian presidential nominee, says he has a shot at upsetting the major-party nominees in November provided he’s included in the nationally televised presidential debates. "You know, I don’t want to peak too early," Johnson said, seemingly jokingly, in an August 2012 interview for KLRU-TV’s "Overheard." Host Evan Smith asked if some states could prove opportunities for Johnson, who replied: "I am going to argue that I might be a factor everywhere, not just in certain states," though he said he needs to be in the debates to have that chance. "It’s important to point out that I am going to be on the ballot in all 50 states," Johnson said. "There is no other third-party candidate that’s going to come close to achieving that." Are both parts of that so? The last third-party presidential candidate to make a significant White House run was Texan Ross Perot in 1992, as noted in a Sept. 12, 2012, CNN news article. Perot also was the last third-party hopeful to be invited to the debates. CNN said Johnson, who initially announced his candidacy as a Republican, has not raised much money, nor does he have a big campaign staff. Still, he told CNN: "No other third party is going to come close to this 50-ballot access." We tried to pin down how many states’ ballots will include Johnson, ultimately realizing that court battles have delayed final decisions in a few states. Libertarian Party spokeswoman Carla Howell said by phone that Johnson will be on the ballot in 47 states while litigation has tied up his standing in Pennsylvania and Michigan. Depending on legal outcomes, then, he could end up on the ballot in 49 to 50 states, she said. Johnson campaign spokesman Joe Hunter also put the number at 47 states, with the other states tied up in legal challenges. For an independent count, we turned to Richard Winger, editor of the California-based Ballot Access News. As of mid-September, he said, Johnson appears likely to be on the ballot in 48 or 49 states, depending on how courts rule, with the Green Party nominee, Jill Stein, on nearly 40 ballots. Winger said his counts are based on printing off candidate lists from the web pages of state election officials. He said all or parts of five states had yet to finalize November ballots, he said, because of outstanding issues. He specified Connecticut, Michigan, Kansas, Colorado and New York. Winger pointed us to a Politics1.com chart that he described as generally up to date on the presidential hopefuls set to appear on each ballot. As of Sept. 18, 2012, the chart indicated that Johnson will appear on the ballot in every state except Oklahoma and possibly Pennsylvania and Michigan, which had question marks showing. The chart indicates Stein will be on the ballot in 38 states including Texas, while she has qualified as a write-in hopeful in five others. Nominees of other third parties are listed as making fewer ballots. Ron Gunzburger, Politics1.com’s publisher and editor, told us by phone that the chart’s notations are based on news accounts, information from state election officials and reports by Ballot Access News. And why is Johnson appearing on most state ballots? "The Libertarian Party works hard on ballot access all the time," Winger said, and has more members with greater income to pay for such efforts than the Green Party. Broadly, Winger said, the Libertarian Party was positioned to have its nominee on ballots in 29 states by the start of 2012, thanks to sufficient voter signatures being collected in the states or because past candidates had drawn enough votes to qualify its 2012 nominees for the ballot. By the same time, he said, the Green Party was positioned to be on the ballot in 16 states. "They just don’t have as much money" to pay individuals who collect voter signatures, Winger said. "These things get done by hiring paid circulators. It’s really very sad. What we have in effect is enormous filing fees for third parties." Looking back, Winger said, the Libertarian presidential nominee appeared on every state ballot in 1980, 1992 and 1996. Perot made every ballot in 1992 and 1996, and U.S. Rep. John Anderson made every state ballot in 1980. Winger said Lenora Fulani, nominee of the New Alliance Party, made every ballot in 1988. Our ruling Johnson said he’s going to be on the ballot in every state and no other third-party nominee will come close. He’s poised to be on the ballot in at least 47 states compared to about 40 states for Stein, the Green Party choice. We rate his claim as Mostly True.

pomt-07861	Fox News "said the New Black Panther Party decided the election for Barack Obama."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/09/rachel-maddow/rachel-maddow-says-fox-news-said-new-black-panther/	In an interview on the Late Show with David Letterman, Rachel Maddow said there's a big difference in the approaches of MSNBC and Fox: MSNBC, the network that carries her nightly show, is concerned with accuracy. Fox is not. "I of course think that we (MSNBC) are much more true than Fox is true," Maddow said in the Dec. 15, 2010, interview. "The problem that I think is reasonable to assert about Fox and its coverage is that they make up stories out of whole cloth and then make a big deal out of them." She continued, "For example, they said the New Black Panther Party decided the election for Barack Obama. They ran dozens and dozens and dozens of stories about the New Black Panther Party, which was one guy who braided his beard in Philadelphia and who didn’t have an organization, yelling on a street corner. They represented that story as if that is the guy who decided the election. That was fake." A few weeks after that appearance, a PolitiFact reader wrote us to ask if we could fact-check Maddow’s statement that Fox News "said the New Black Panther Party decided the election for Barack Obama." So we will. First, some background on the controversy Maddow referenced. We addressed it in some detail in a previous item, but here’s a summary: In mid 2010, Fox News pundits hammered the Obama administration for its handling of a voter intimidation case involving the New Black Panther Party (which is not related to the original Black Panthers), specifically, that the Obama administration backed off the case because it is afraid of prosecuting minorities for civil rights violations. At issue was an incident on Nov. 4, 2008 -- the day of the presidential election -- when New Black Panther Party members Jerry Jackson and King Samir Shabazz stood outside a Philadelphia polling place dressed in black military-style uniforms. Shabazz held a nightstick, and the two men were accused of making intimidating remarks to both white and black voters. (You can see it on YouTube here.) On Jan. 7, 2009, two weeks before Obama took office, the Department of Justice filed a civil action accusing the two men, as well as the New Black Panther Party and its leader Malik Zulu Shabazz, of engaging in voter intimidation. Although none of the defendants responded to the complaint, the department later dropped its case against all but King Samir Shabazz, the one with the nightstick. The department asked for, and got, an injunction prohibiting Shabazz from displaying a weapon within 100 feet of a Philadelphia polling location until 2012. Many Fox News commentators criticized the government's position as outrageously lenient and saw it as evidence of an Obama administration double-standard on race issues. But Maddow’s comment to Letterman framed Fox’s coverage of the issue in political, rather than legal, terms. Was she correct that Fox News had claimed that "the New Black Panther Party decided the election for Barack Obama"? We looked at dozens of Fox transcripts between June 30, 2010, and July 14, 2010, because those dates coincide with the span of coverage that Media Matters for America, a liberal group that tracks media coverage, analyzed in a blog post on July 16, 2010. Maddow referenced the Media Matters post in her blog’s item on the Letterman appearance, so we thought it would be appropriate to use that study’s parameters as the basis for checking her statement on the Late Show. When we contacted Jess Levin, a spokeswoman for Media Matters, she told us that her group had chosen that time frame because Fox News’ coverage of the controversy during that period had been especially extensive. The transcripts showed that indeed there was lots of coverage on Fox. However, the discussions focused on the legal side of the story and the question of whether other media outlets were derelict in not giving it enough attention. Here are some examples of Fox News’ coverage: • On June 30, Fox anchor Megyn Kelly appeared on Hannity to talk about the Justice Department’s dismissal of the case. "The law says that's voter intimidation -- that if you intimidate voters from not going in the polling station or you attempt to intimidate voters. And there was testimony by one person who was trying to vote that the one guy held up his arms and physically blocked him from going that the polling station. Now, I mean, you tell me: is that or is that not voter intimidation?" • On July 9, Fox covered a statement by the New Black Panther Party attacking Fox host Glenn Beck. Beck appeared on the O’Reilly Factor to discuss the matter. "I wonder if anyone on any other network would talk about his hate speech or talk about his inciting violence or talk about the fact that the New Black Panther Party is a -- is a hate group." • On July 12, Fox host Bill O’Reilly aired a segment about the "mainstream media" ignoring the New Black Panther Party story. In it, he said that Attorney General Eric Holder was "getting away with this because the liberal print press and the network news (is) pretty much ignoring the story." • On July 14, Fox covered the NAACP passage of a resolution condemning "racist elements" of the tea party. In one segment, Sean Hannity claimed that there was a double standard on racism. Speaking to conservative activist and media figure Andrew Breitbart, Hannity said, "I haven't heard any Democrats talk about the New Black Panther Party standing outside the polling place, Andrew." But in all the coverage we examined, we couldn't find a single case in which the discussion revolved around the political impact of the incident, including whether the New Black Panther Party had helped put the Obama campaign over the top in 2008. (Needless to say, since Obama won by more than 8 million votes, it's not like one guy with a nightstick at a single polling place swung the election.) When we reached out to Maddow, a spokeswoman pointed us to a commentary segment she did on her MSNBC show on July 21, 2010, that provided the full context of her criticism of Fox’s New Black Panther Party coverage. Maddow argued that coverage of that story -- combined with its criticism of African American administration figures such as Van Jones and Shirley Sherrod -- amounted to a manufactured theme of "black people are coming for you." She suggested that it was the most recent iteration of race-baiting techniques that date to the segregation era. "For normal news outlets," Maddow said, the New Black Panther case simply "wasn’t a story" -- and rightfully so. That's an opinion, but it doesn't support her allegation that Fox said the New Black Panther Party "decided the election" for Obama. Maddow would have been correct if she had simply said that Fox's coverage was more extensive and hyperbolic than other networks. But her claim that Fox News "said the New Black Panther Party decided the election for Barack Obama" is not supported by the transcripts we reviewed. In reality, Fox’s coverage focused on legal, racial and media-related issues, rather than the electoral impact on Obama. So we find her claim False.

pomt-00020	Says Clint Eastwood said "one day we will realize that the Barack Obama presidency was the biggest fraud ever perpetrated on the American people." ​	mostly true	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/nov/06/blog-posting/fraud-vs-hoax-viral-post-gets-clint-eastwood-knock/	You’d think it was 2012 the way conservative bloggers are namechecking Barack Obama this election season. He’s not a candidate, but he is campaigning for Democrats. And some detractors are reviving an old dig against the former president. "One day we will realize that the Barack Obama presidency was the biggest fraud ever perpetrated on the American people," reads a quote in an image that was posted to Facebook on Nov. 4. It’s attributed to Clint Eastwood and appears next to a picture of the actor sitting on a stool. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Eastwood isn’t sitting on the stool—the empty one he talked to during the 2012 Republican National Convention, pretending Obama was seated next to him on stage. He considered the appearance a success, and he said so to the Carmel Pine Cone a few days later. The newspaper covers Eastwood’s hometown, where he was elected mayor in 1986. A story published in the paper on Sept. 7, 2012, reports that Eastwood had three points that he wanted to make that day: "That not everybody in Hollywood is on the left, that Obama has broken a lot of the promises he made when he took office, and that the people should feel free to get rid of any politician who’s not doing a good job." "President Obama is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people," the paper quotes Eastwood as saying. "(Mitt) Romney and (Paul) Ryan would do a much better job running the country, and that’s what everybody needs to know. I may have irritated a lot of the lefties, but I was aiming for people in the middle." That’s not quite what the Facebook post said. Eastwood was talking about Obama, the person, not his presidency. And he called the then-president a hoax, not a fraud. Still, the quote is close to the spirit of Eastwood’s comments. One person who did get it right? Donald Trump. Three days after the story ran, he tweeted: "‘President Obama is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people.’ --Clint Eastwood" We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-14770	"We lock up close to 2.4 million people in this country. We're locking up more people than China and Russia."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/dec/09/joe-donald/us-incarcerates-more-people-china-or-russia-state-/	China has nearly 1.4 billion people -- four times as many as the United States’ 321 million. So, does the U.S. really incarcerate more people than China (and Russia, too)? That is the claim from Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Joe Donald, who is challenging recently appointed state Supreme Court Justice Rebecca Bradley in the spring 2016 election. State appeals court Judge JoAnne Kloppenburg, who was a candidate for the high court in 2011, and Madison attorney Claude Covelli are also running. In a Dec. 2, 2015 interview on "The Devil’s Advocates," a liberal radio talk show in Madison, Donald was asked about racial justice being part of his platform. Donald, who would be the first African-American elected to the state’s high court (former Justice Louis Butler was appointed, then lost an election), said he supports alternatives to jail and prison. "It isn't all about simply retribution and punishment," he said. "That if you treat the underlying issues, then in essence you transform that person's life, you rehabilitate them, they are able to be productive citizens and they're able to be strong advocates for their families. "And by strengthening families, in my opinion, you actually reduce crime. And so I'm a huge proponent of trying to address that issue. You know, we lock up close to 2.4 million in this country. We're locking up more people than China and Russia." We'll see from a recent fact check that Donald's statement is essentially on target, though available figures for China are to some extent understated. The numbers In October 2015, PolitiFact National rated Mostly True a statement by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is seeking the 2016 Democratic nomination for president. He said: "Today in America, we have more people in jail than any other country on Earth." The U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics’ latest figures showed there were more than 2.22 million people in local jails, and state and federal prisons in 2013. We found that other estimates -- which can vary based on the time they were made and the definition of incarceration -- are similar. The University of London-based Institute for Criminal Policy Research also uses 2.22 million. And an estimate from the Massachusetts-based Prison Policy Initiative, a think tank that advocates for reducing the American prison population, was slightly higher, at 2.4 million. Those figures put the United States at No. 1 in the world in terms of incarcerating people. (A key reason, Prison Policy Initiative legal director Aleks Kajstura told us, is that U.S. policies were changed in the 1980s to put more offenders in prison or jail, partly because of the war on drugs.) It’s a little harder to get rock-solid numbers internationally. China is second, with 1.66 million prisoners, and Russia is third, with 642,470, according to the Institute for Criminal Policy Research. But China’s incarcerated population could very well be higher, the center notes. Chinese government officials reported in 2009 that more than 650,000 people were being held in detention centers around China on top of the count for sentenced prisoners. If that number was the same in mid-2013, the total prison population would be more than 2.3 million in China. In terms of rate -- the number of people incarcerated compared to the entire population -- the United States is also well above Russia and China. The U.S. incarceration rate is 698 per 100,000 people, far outpacing Russia (445) and China (119), according to the Institute for Criminal Policy Research. That is second in the world behind tiny Seychelles (799), an Indian Ocean nation of 115 islands. Our rating Donald said: "We lock up close to 2.4 million people in this country. We're locking up more people than China and Russia." The best estimates are that the United States incarcerates 2.2 million to 2.4 people, far ahead of available figures for both China and Russia. But it’s possible the China numbers are under counted. We rate Donald’s statement Mostly True. More on incarceration Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn: In Milwaukee County, juveniles arrested for car theft "get sent immediately home, because under the point system in juvenile court" on holding suspects, "a stolen car gets zero points." Mostly False. U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Milwaukee: Scott Walker "brags a lot about having an independent agency investigate police shootings. Of course, he didn’t fund it." Mostly False. Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson, in Milwaukee: "There are more young black males involved in the criminal justice system than there are in higher education." False.

pomt-10257	McCain's energy plan is a "single-answer proposition" — new domestic oil drilling.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/27/brian-schweitzer/mccain-energy-plan-not-just-more-drilling/	In a spirited oratory during the second night of the Democratic National Convention, Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer — the animated guy wearing the bolo tie — attacked Sen. John McCain's energy plan as reliant on more domestic oil drilling. "We can't simply drill our way to energy independence," Schweitzer said. "That single-answer proposition is a dry well. And here's why: America consumes 25 percent of the oil but has less than 3 percent of the reserves. You don't need a $2 calculator to figure that one out. There just isn't enough oil in America — on land or offshore — to meet America's full energy needs." It is true that in recent months McCain has become a cheerleader for opening up new areas to offshore drilling. But to summarize McCain's energy plan as a "single-answer proposition" based on more domestic oil production is inaccurate. McCain's "all of the above" catch-phrase is a staple of speeches, meant to highlight that his energy plan calls not just for more domestic oil production, but also more nuclear power, coal and alternative energy exploration. Even as he delivered a speech from an oil rig platform in the Gulf of Mexico on Aug. 19, 2008, McCain stressed that more domestic oil drilling is only part of his energy plan. "Solving our energy crisis requires an 'all of the above' approach," McCain said. "It will require aggressive development of alternative energies like wind, solar, tidal and biofuels. It also requires expanding traditional sources of energy like clean coal, nuclear power, and offshore drilling like that done on this rig." Among McCain's proposals to achieve "strategic" energy independence by 2025: • $5,000 tax credit to those who buy a zero carbon emission car. • $300-million prize (one dollar for every person in the United States) for the development of a battery package "that has the size, capacity, cost and power to leapfrog the commercially available plug-in hybrids or electric cars." • Tougher enforcement of federal standards on mileage requirements that automobile manufacturers' cars must meet. • $2-billion annually to advance clean coal technology sources. • 45 new nuclear power plants by 2030. • Tax credits to encourage the market for alternative, low-carbon fuels such as wind, hydro and solar power "until the market transforms sufficiently to the point where renewable energy no longer merits the taxpayers' dollars." Obama has countered that despite his campaign platitudes, McCain as a U.S. senator has "voted against renewable sources of energy, against biofuels, against solar power, against wind power, against an energy bill that — while far from perfect — represented the largest investment in renewable sources of energy in the history of this country." We looked at that Aug. 5 statement and ruled it Mostly True. In 2005, McCain voted against a series of amendments to an energy bill that set higher goals for the use of renewable energy. One proposal required refineries to use 8-billion gallons of renewable fuel by 2012 and another required 10 percent of electricity sold by utilities by 2020 be produced by renewable energy. Both passed and were included in the final bill, which McCain voted against. The Obama campaign cites McCain's vote against the 2005 energy bill, which was signed into law by President Bush, as evidence of him voting against wind power. McCain did vote against the measure, in part because he thought a federal tax credit for alternative energy production was too generous and not cost-effective. But McCain voted in favor of a 1992 energy law that required some government agencies to begin using vehicles that ran on alternative fuels and authorized more than $500-million in Energy Department research on renewable energy. And in 2002, McCain and Democratic Sen. John Kerry pushed a plan to raise mileage standards for cars. The effort failed. Some may argue that McCain's plan doesn't do enough to develop alternative fuels, or that his plan for new domestic oil drilling perpetuates the country's dependence on oil, but that doesn't mean McCain's energy plan is "a single-answer proposition" built around new oil drilling. It clearly is not. In fact, McCain's energy plan includes many provisions that have nothing to do with drilling. Schweitzer's claim isn't just false, it's ridiculously so.

pomt-14270	"There are no rules governing" the 2016 Republican convention, "the rules have not been set."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/apr/08/john-kasich/no-rules-place-picking-gop-presidential-nominee-go/	Tell John Kasich he should drop out because he can’t amass enough delegates in the primaries and caucuses to win the Republican nomination for president, and he has a ready response. The Ohio governor will tell you he’s the GOP candidate best positioned to beat Hillary Clinton, should she be the Democratic nominee. So, the Kasich campaign forges on, with this hope: Neither Donald Trump nor Ted Cruz will earn the required 1,237 delegates prior to the party’s convention in July 2016 to win the nomination outright. That scenario would mean an "open" or "contested" convention in Cleveland, with Kasich aiming to persuade delegates to make him the nominee. On April 3, 2016, two days before he failed to win any delegates in Wisconsin’s primary, Kasich made a claim on ABC’s "This Week" that, if true, could bolster his chances to be the nominee. It was made during this exchange with host George Stephanopoulos: Stephanopoulos: You still have won only one state, however it is. You know under the current rules of the Republican National Committee, your only hope is to get to a contested convention. But under the current rules, you wouldn't even be eligible for the nomination, because you haven't picked up a majority of delegates in eight states. It doesn't appear that you're going to be able to do that. So how do you intend to get that rule changed? Kasich: Well, first of all, George, I'm not going to spend time on process. I have some of the best process people, you know, whether it's John Weaver or Charlie Black or Stu Spencer. But there are no rules governing the next convention. The rules have not been set. And we'll see what a rules committee decides to do. But I expect that we're going to be gaining momentum, picking up delegates and heading into the convention. What we found is Kasich is mostly on target. The 2016 convention will essentially start with the same rules that were in place for the 2012 convention. But then the rules can be changed. The process If all this sounds rather nerdy, consider that Google searches for "Republican convention rules" shot up by a factor of 100 in March 2016. As PolitiFact National explained in a primer on delegates, here’s what happens: On the Republican convention’s first ballot, nearly all of the 2,472 delegates are obligated to vote for the candidate who won their district or state. But if no candidate nabs the 1,237 votes needed on the first ballot, most delegates are released to support whomever they want on subsequent votes. Then there’s the 112 members of the rules committee. They determine convention guidelines, and they have the power to change rules at the convention. Should Trump (the GOP front runner, in terms of delegates) fail to nab the majority of delegates on the first ballot — and at this point, that looks entirely possible — the race becomes a fight for the support of those on the convention floor. Josh Putnam, one of the experts quoted in the primer, filled in a few more of the blanks for us. Putnam, who is a political science lecturer at the University of Georgia and founder of Frontloading HQ blog, which tracks the presidential primary calendar, said: The convention writes, tweaks and adopts its own rules. (But) the standard procedure is that the convention rules from one convention carry over to the next. There may be some subtle changes, but they largely carry over. So while there are only temporary rules now, they can serve as the baseline set of rules for this convention. As for the possibility of changing Rule 40 (b) -- Stephanopoulos’ reference to the requirement that a GOP candidate win eight states to be eligible for the nomination -- that has already been discussed. Politico reported in March 2016 that according to current and former Republican National Committee rules committee members, a Republican presidential candidate likely won’t have to abide by that rule. No number is in effect for the Cleveland convention, according to former Republican National Committee lawyer Ben Ginsberg, whom the article described as the party's preeminent election law expert. He said: "The 2016 convention and its rules committee has to make that decision. So there is no eight-state rule in effect right now for the next convention. The 2016 convention can make that number one, eight, 18, 28 or 58, if it wishes." Curly Haugland, a member of the convention’s rules committee from North Dakota, told Politico that rules 26 through 42 stood for the 2012 convention but are only temporary until the rules committee and order of business reports are adopted at the 2016 convention. In other words, those rules could remain, or they could be changed. Moreover, it’s still to be determined who will serve on the rules committee in Cleveland. Each state and territory delegation chooses two delegates to serve on the rules committee. Lest there be any debate about the potential for rules to be changed, the Republican National Committee itself says: A week before the convention, the 2016 Convention Rules Committee must convene to put together a package of rules to recommend for consideration by all delegates. The committee, after debate and discussion, adopts by majority vote a package of recommended rules that moves to the convention floor. Once a majority of the convention delegates adopt the report, the rules become the permanent rules governing that Convention. Our rating Kasich said "there are no rules governing" the 2016 Republican convention, "the rules have not been set." The 2016 convention will essentially start with the same rules that were in place for the 2012 convention. But the new rules committee for the 2016 convention can change any of the rules.

Medicaid is a government-run health insurance program that primarily serves low-income Americans. If Congress repeals the law known as Obamacare and replaces it with the leading Republican proposal, there could be as many as 14 million fewer Medicaid enrollees by 2026, compared to projections under current law, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Mick Mulvaney, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, says the CBO analysis is wrong. "The CBO score assumes that if you are on Medicaid today that you choose to get off Medicaid after the mandate goes away," Mulvaney said to reporters March 13, speaking of the Affordable Care Act’s mandate that most individuals purchase insurance. "Does that make sense to anybody? That you are on a free program — because the plan doesn't get rid of Medicaid expansion." We decided to fact-check Mulvaney’s claim that the leading House Republican proposal — the American Health Care Act — "doesn’t get rid of Medicaid expansion." We found his claim misleading. While the legislation doesn’t explicitly repeal the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion, it reduces federal funding for the program to the point that many states would likely find continuing it unsustainable. How the Republican proposal stifles Medicaid expansion Individual states administer their own Medicaid programs, with financial assistance from the federal government, and each state sets its own specific parameters for Medicaid eligibility. Since the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010, 31 states and the District of Columbia opted to expand those parameters to include all people with incomes up to 138 percent of the poverty line. On average, the federal government matches 57 percent of each state’s Medicaid expenditures. But it pays at least 90 percent for additional Medicaid enrollees who were made eligible by the expansion. The House Republican health care proposal says states can keep their expanded eligibility parameters. However, starting in 2020, the federal government would no longer pay extra for new Medicaid enrollees who are eligible because of the expansion — doing away with a vital component of the policy, the money. That means Medicaid costs would go way up for state governments that opted to continue their expanded programs. In order to maintain their current level of coverage, it would cost states an additional $253 billion over 10 years, according to estimates by the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. As a result, the CBO and independent experts anticipate that states will decide to pull back from the Medicaid expansion, and states that were considering expanding their eligibility requirements in the coming years will decide against it. "States don't have the wherewithal to pick up all of the substantially increased burden — especially when the next recession comes," said Joan Alker, executive director of the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University. Further, in seven states — Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Mexico and Washington — state law requires ending Medicaid expansion if the federal government lowers its funding rate, or if the state has to take action to keep its own Medicaid costs from going up, according to Edwin Park, vice president for health policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Michael Cannon, health policy studies director at the libertarian Cato Institute, presented a different outcome in a blog post criticizing the House proposal as "Obamacare lite — or worse." Cannon predicted that by allowing the expansion to continue until 2020, voters, state officials and special interests will resist eliminating it. The House proposal says the federal government would pay the enhanced rate for Medicaid expansion enrollees who got into the program prior to 2020, as long as they maintain continuous coverage. However, changes in income and family situation, and thus Medicaid eligibility, happen frequently among low-income adults. Experts anticipate few individuals enrolled before 2020 will be able to maintain continuous coverage — especially given that the law would add more stringent requirements for coverage renewal. "While this may seem like a reasonable way to protect coverage for those who already have it, in practice this means that the Medicaid expansion would wither on the vine and could shrink to nearly nothing in just a few short years," wrote Harvard University health policy professor Benjamin Sommers in the Washington Post. Our ruling Mulvaney said the House Republican health care "plan doesn't get rid of Medicaid expansion." The House Republican health care proposal does not explicitly repeal the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion. But by wringing out the funding that supports the expansion starting in 2020, experts predict states will have little choice but to abandon some or all of the expansion. In seven states, it’s actually required by state law. Mulvaney’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-11533	"Fifty seats have already changed hands from the Republicans to the Democrats since Donald Trump was elected."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2018/feb/15/corey-lewandowski/have-democrats-gained-50-seats-formerly-held-repub/	President Donald Trump’s former campaign manager had a prescient message for Republican voters: get out and vote, or risk losing more seats to Democrats. Corey Lewandowski traveled to Sarasota on Feb. 11, along with former Trump deputy campaign manager David Bossie, to rally for Florida House candidate James Buchanan, a Republican in a tight race against Democrat Margaret Good with Trump barely winning the district in 2016. "The Democrats are highly motivated," Lewandowski told the crowd at Dolphin Aviation. "They are winning elections in places where they shouldn’t. We’ve seen them win state House races in Wisconsin. We’ve seen them win big mayor’s races in New Hampshire. Fifty seats have already changed hands from the Republicans to the Democrats since Donald Trump was elected." We wanted to know whether Democrats gained 50 seats formerly held by Republicans since Trump’s election. The bulk of Lewandowski’s count is backed up by legislative races. The trend even played out in the very district Lewandowski was trying to keep red, with Good beating out Buchanan for the Sarasota seat on Feb. 13. However, we could not verify Lewandowski’s exact figure because he is counting small municipal elections, which can be hard to track. We could not reach him for this fact-check. We documented 39 Democratic takeaways Many experts we spoke to referred us to an analysis by Daily Kos Elections, which shows that Democrats took 36 seats, as of Feb. 11, 2018. (The Daily Kos is liberal political website. We verified the races on the spreadsheet.) The total includes special election victories, such as Democrat Doug Jones’ win over Republican Roy Moore in Alabama and the special election for a state Senate seat in Wisconsin’s 10th District. It also includes regular elections. For example, Democrats picked up 15 seats in the Virginia statehouse and a few more seats in New Jersey on Election Day in 2017. The Daily Kos list, however, doesn’t include Democrat Phil Murphy’s win over Republican Kim Guadagno in the general election to succeed New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. The New Jersey governor’s race brings the initial total to 37 Democratic gains. We found a slightly lower total from Geoffrey Skelley, the associate editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics. Skelley found that Democrats have gained 33 seats on net in special elections for state and federal legislature and elections in New Jersey and Virginia. Unlike the Daily Kos, Skelley’s net total reflects that Republicans took three seats away from Democrats in special elections and one seat away in New Jersey. From here, we tried to find examples of municipal races where Democrats won seats from Republicans — not an easy task. There is no database of smaller municipal elections nationwide. Further, municipal elections are often nonpartisan races, so candidates aren’t officially latched to one party or the other. With those limitations, we searched news stories. An article by the Huffington Post about "historic victories" by Democrats on Nov. 7, 2017, includes two clear-cut examples of Democratic mayoral candidates beating Republican incumbents, including the Manchester, N.H., mayor’s race that Lewandowski mentioned in his speech. Adding those races to the highest number of state-level wins brings our verified total to at least 39 flipped seats for Democrats. The big picture Regardless of the exact number, there’s no denying Lewandowski’s point: Democrats have won a significant number of elections since Trump won the presidency. "Bottom line is that President Trump is energizing the Democratic Party," said Nathan Gonzales, the editor and publisher of Inside Elections, which provides nonpartisan analysis of campaigns for Congress, governorships and president. Skelley said that the shift "reflects the pendulum-swing nature of politics." "Given the fact that Democrats lost nearly 1,000 state legislative seats during Obama’s time in office, including a multitude of losses in his first midterm cycle in 2010, I don’t think Democratic gains in the early days of Trump’s presidency are unprecedented," Skelley said. Our ruling Lewandowski said, "Fifty seats have already changed hands from the Republicans to the Democrats since Donald Trump was elected." We found evidence of almost 40 seats that flipped from Republican to Democratic control since Trump took office. The bulk happened at the state legislative level. However, Lewandowski is also counting small municipal elections, which are harder to track. We found a couple of examples of Democratic mayors beating Republican incumbents. Beyond mayor’s races, it’s hard to say a seat flipped when some local elections are nonpartisan. We could not reach Lewandowski to explain how he got to 50. Given that we couldn’t duplicate Lewandowski’s total but he’s right about the trend, we rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-06194	Says the paperback edition of Mitt Romney's book deleted line that Massachusetts' individual mandate "should be the model for the country"	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/11/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-mitt-romneys-book-deleted-line-mas/	Rick Perry was smart to say he's not in the betting business. Mitt Romney's $10,000 health care wager at a Republican presidential debate in Iowa on Dec. 10, 2011 had pundits declaring him "rich, elite, and out of touch." ("Romney bombed with a bet"!) But was he right on the merits? The subject of bet-worthy disagreement was well-worn territory: The Texas governor declared that Romney's book No Apology called his Massachusetts health care law "the model for the country," including its individual mandate that people buy health insurance. That is, until the line was deleted from a later version of the book, Perry said. Perry kept up the familiar refrain on the next day's Fox News Sunday: "The issue of individual mandates is still at the center here, and Mitt can deny this as many times as he wants, but in his first book, hardcover, of No Apologies, he clearly stated that individual mandate should be the model for this country. And then he took that out of the book, in the paperback, and that's the fact, and even a $10,000 bet is not gonna cover that." PolitiFact has peeked into Perry's book claims before, so we were ready to rule on this one. The exchange In a September debate, Perry accused Romney of removing a line that the Massachusetts health care law was exactly what the American people needed. We found that claim Mostly False. In this debate, Perry focused his rhetoric on the "individual mandate" — a controversial requirement of President Barack Obama's federal health care law that everyone buy health insurance. It was also part of Romney's state health care law. Perry said that both Romney and Newt Gingrich "have been for the individual mandate." Romney fired back that "as (House) speaker, Gingrich said that he was for a federal individual mandate. That's something I've always opposed. What we did in our state was designed by the people in our state for the needs of our state. You believe in the 10th Amendment. I believe in the 10th Amendment." Soon, the wager war broke out: PERRY: "Well, I'm listening to you, Mitt, and I'm hearing you say all the right things. But I read your first book, and it said in there that your mandate in Massachusetts, which should be the model for the country -- and I know it came out of the reprint of the book, but, you know, I'm just saying, you were for individual mandates, my friend." ROMNEY: "You know what, you've raised that before, Rick. And you're simply wrong." PERRY: "It was true then ..." ROMNEY: "No, no ..." PERRY: "And it's true now." ROMNEY: "Rick, I'll tell you what ..." (LAUGHTER) ROMNEY: "... 10,000 bucks? $10,000 bet?" PERRY: "I'm not in the betting business ..." ROMNEY: "Oh, okay." PERRY: "... but I'll show you the" ROMNEY: "I wrote the ..." PERRY: "I'll show you the book." ROMNEY: "I've got the book and ..." (LAUGHTER) ROMNEY: "And I wrote the book. And I have it. And Chapter 7, there's a section called "The Massachusetts Model," and I say as close, as I can quote, I say, in my view, each state should be able to fashion their own program for the specific needs of their distinct citizens. "And then I go on to talk about the states being the laboratories of democracy, and we can learn from one another. I have not said in that book, first edition or the latest edition, anything about our plan being a national model imposed on the nation. The right course for America -- and I've said this during the debates last time around; I'll say it now and time again -- is to let individual states -- this is a remarkable nation. This idea of federalism is so extraordinary. Let states craft their own solutions. Don't have ObamaCare put on us by the federal government." Who got it right, Perry or Romney? What the books say Perry's grievance is with differences between hardcover and paperback editions of Romney's book. We've combed through Chapter 7 of both. Romney's changes to the book have been explored before, by Boston political journalist David S. Bernstein. He noted in February 2011 that Romney had added harsher language on the national health care law as passed: "Obamacare will not work and should be repealed," and, "Obamacare is an unconstitutional federal incursion into the rights of states." Romney more clearly explained ways that he disagreed with implementation of the Massachusetts law. He also changed this line, which came after a paragraph touting the success of the Massachusetts health plan: Hardcover: "We can accomplish the same thing for everyone in the country, and it can be done without letting government take over health care." To: Paperback: "And it was done without government taking over health care." The deleted 11 words, "We can accomplish the same thing for everyone in the country" are the crux of Perry's argument. His campaign sent e-mail the day after the debate with a link highlighting precisely that change. It looks suspicious, right? Perhaps Romney did extol every piece of his Massachusetts plan, individual mandate and all, for every state in the union. But here's the original quote with full context from Page 177 of the hardcover: "My own preference would be to let each state fashion its own program to meet the distinct needs of its citizens. States could follow the Massachusetts model of they choose, or they could develop plans of their own. These plans, tested in the state 'laboratories of democracy' could be evaluated, compared, improved upon, and adopted by others. But the creation of a national plan is the direction in which Washington is currently moving. If a national approach is ultimately adopted, we should permit individuals to purchase insurance from companies in other states in order to expand choice and competition. "What we accomplished surprised us: 440,000 people who previously had no health insurance became insured, many paying their own way. We made it possible for each newly insured person to have better care, and ultimately healthier and longer lives. From now on, no one in Massachusetts has to worry about losing his or her health insurance if there is a job change or a loss in income; everyone is insured and pays only what he or she can afford. It's portable, affordable health insurance — something people have been talking about for decades. We can accomplish the same thing for everyone in the country, and it can be done without letting government take over health care." Romney's not really saying the Massachusetts law "should be the model for the country," the way that Perry describes it. He's in fact presenting a defense of state-level choice. It's like a shout-out to other state leaders: Hey, you can have what Massachusetts has! And it's consistent with what Romney fired back at Perry in the Sept. 22, 2011 debate: "This is a state plan for a state, it is not a national plan." And with how he characterized his own book in the most recent debate: "I say, in my view, each state should be able to fashion their own program for the specific needs of their distinct citizens." Romney did support Massachusetts' individual mandate. But we don't see evidence in his hardcover book that he supported a federal one, much less that he removed such a reference from later editions. Our ruling Perry's right that Romney's comments about health care were edited between editions. Among other things, a line that advocated the Massachusetts model as a strong option for other states was replaced by a shorter, more generic sentence. But that line was preceded by an argument for state-level solutions, exactly the argument Romney extends now. That's not how Perry characterized it. So he did win that bet — by not betting. We rule his claim Mostly False.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2011-12-11T13:10:37	2011-12-10	['Massachusetts', 'Mitt_Romney']
pomt-05918	"The Obama administration ... would impose on every Catholic institution, every Jewish institution, every Protestant institution the Obamacare standard of what you have to buy as insurance."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/31/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-obama-administration-would-impo/	Newt Gingrich, on the campaign trail before the Florida GOP primary, called out the Barack Obama administration for engaging in a "war against religion." Federal officials' interpretation of the 2010 health care law violates religious freedom, he said. "Their decision last week that they would impose on every Catholic institution, every Jewish institution, every Protestant institution the Obamacare standard of what you have to buy as insurance is a direct violation of freedom of religion, an example of the dictatorial attitude of this administration," he told voters in Jacksonville, Fla., on Jan. 30, 2012. What decision was he talking about? One about birth control. His campaign pointed us to criticism from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops of a Jan. 20 decision that "ordered almost every employer and insurer in the country to provide sterilization and contraceptives, including some abortion-inducing drugs, in their health plans," according to the group. The bishops said "almost every employer and insurer." We wondered, was Gingrich right that the Obama administration "would impose on every Catholic institution, every Jewish institution, every Protestant institution the Obamacare standard of what you have to buy as insurance"? 'The Obamacare standard' The rule Gingrich was talking about, announced by Health and Human Services Department Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, addressed which preventive services must be covered by insurers without a co-pay, co-insurance or a deductible paid by the recipient of medical care. We should mention: There's not a clear "Obamacare standard of what you have to buy as insurance." The law provides for co-pay-free preventive care, which is what Sebelius clarified Jan. 20. And for individual and small-group plans, the law requires that policies cover "essential health benefits." They must include services in 10 categories, but the details have been left to the states. The idea of co-pay-free preventive care stems from studies that show that even moderate co-pays kept women from getting care, such as mammograms or pap smears, according to HHS. The nongovernmental Institute of Medicine recommended that preventive services include "all FDA-approved forms of contraception." So that's what HHS decided to include in its final rule about preventive services. Most health insurance plans will have to cover them without a co-pay, co-insurance or a deductible. For most new and renewed health plans, that requirement kicks in Aug. 1, 2012. Religious exemptions Notice we said that "most" health insurance plans will have to offer co-pay-free preventive care. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops said "almost every employer and insurer." Gingrich said, "every Catholic institution, every Jewish institution, every Protestant institution." But the rule provides an exemption for "certain non-profit religious employers" that meet a four-part test -- essentially churches and synagogues, but also some primary and secondary religious schools. It's that definition of "religious employer" that has prompted the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, with the support of groups such as the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, to fight the rule. That's because it wouldn't cover religious organizations that don't primarily employ or serve people of the same religion — ruling out many universities, hospitals and charitable groups. That would require, say, a Catholic hospital to offer insurance coverage to its employees that included FDA-approved contraceptive drugs — which includes some drugs that Catholics consider abortion-inducing. Plan B and Ella prevent fertilization of an egg, prompting the FDA to categorize them as contraceptives rather than abortion-inducing drugs, but Catholics argue that Ella can be used like the abortifacient RU-486, which isn't considered a contraceptive by the FDA. The government is giving such nonprofit religious groups an extra year to implement the preventive care requirements. But it won't exempt them. The decision already faces legal challenges from Belmont Abbey College and Colorado Christian University. Still, if you consider a Catholic church to be a "Catholic institution," or a synagogue to be a "Jewish institution," Gingrich isn't correct that the recent federal rule on contraceptives applies. Those nonprofit religious employers could choose whether or not they covered contraceptive services. Our ruling Gingrich said that "the Obama administration ... would impose on every Catholic institution, every Jewish institution, every Protestant institution the Obamacare standard of what you have to buy as insurance." He makes a broad statement in reference to a rule dealing specifically with co-pays for preventive care -- making it sound as though there's a blanket "Obamacare standard" for all insurance policies. The reality allows for states to set benchmarks for private individual and small-group plans. Meanwhile, he ignores an exemption in the federal rule for nonprofit religious employers such as churches and synagogues. That exemption has been condemned by Catholic bishops as too narrow and has been challenged in court. But it makes Gingrich's statement that the rule would "impose on every ... institution" inaccurate and misleading. We rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/dd0ecf5b-876e-4cfe-ac88-5c90949e8e9f	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2012-01-31T17:53:50	2012-01-30	['Jews', 'Barack_Obama', 'Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act']
pomt-14480	"We (Trump University) have an ‘A’ from the Better Business Bureau."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/28/donald-trump/fact-checking-donald-trumps-claims-about-trump-uni/	Republican frontrunner Donald Trump’s challengers have called him many things; add to that list the charge from Florida Sen. Marco Rubio that Trump is a con man. Rubio's recent attacks have focused on allegations of false marketing by Trump University. It wasn’t a real university -- and had to change its name to Trump Entrepreneur Institute because of that. It was largely a seminar program that promised to teach its students the real estate secrets that turned Trump into a billionaire. With some participants paying as much as $35,000, the project drew investigations and lawsuits in at least three states. The university registered as a private company in New York in October 2004 and largely shut down by 2011. When NBC host Chuck Todd raised issues with the university, Trump defended the program, noting that nearly all the students thought it was "great." "They signed these documents saying, they rated the course, 98 percent approval rating and high marks," Trump said on Meet the Press on Feb. 28, 2016. And he added, "We have an A from the Better Business Bureau." HELP US RAISE $15,000 TO HIRE AN EXTRA FACT-CHECKER We went to the Better Business Bureau website and saw that as of today, the Trump Entrepreneur Institute has no rating. The website explained, "This business has no rating because BBB has information indicating it is out of business." Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks told us, "When the school was operational it was rated A." We asked Hicks to document that rating and didn’t hear back. Katherine Hutt, director of communications for the Council of Better Business Bureaus, said that as a matter of policy, they don’t provide any ratings from previous years. But the organization issued a statement that "Over the years, the company’s BBB rating has fluctuated between an A+ and a D-." We don’t know when the bureau might have given Trump University a top grade, but based on the Internet Archive, the last time the Better Business Bureau gave the university any rating at all was 2010, when it give it a D-minus. That assessment showed up in plenty of news articles. That year, the New York Daily News reported that "the Better Business Bureau in January slapped a D-minus rating on Trump U., a rating now under review after Trump U. objected." CBS News said the same thing in an April 21, 2010, article. And in May, 2011, the New York Times wrote "The Better Business Bureau gave the school a D-minus for 2010, its second-lowest grade, after receiving 23 complaints." The Washington Post had the same information in May 2011 when it reported that the New York State Attorney General was investigating the Trump Entrepreneur Institute. The Attorney General’s Office did file charges but stumbled on the grounds that the statute of limitations had passed. The matter is under appeal. Under the new name Trump Entrepreneur Initiative, ratings ranged from C to B between 2012 and 2014. We found no ratings at all for the past two years. Our ruling Trump said about his entrepreneur institute that "we have an ‘A’ from the Better Business Bureau." Literally speaking, that is inaccurate. The Better Business Bureau gives the program no rating today because it’s no longer a going concern. Trump University had an A at some point. The Better Business Bureau doesn't release details of its past ratings, but it did say Trump's program had ratings that ranged from A+ to D-. What we do know, from several published reports and archived Web pages, is that the university had a D in 2010 and under its new name, had ratings ranging from C to B, with no ratings after March 2014. Trump’s claim is literally wrong and also ignores the university’s lower Better Business Bureau scores. We rate it False.

pomt-05607	Says Mitt Romney said "we are going to have to live with high gas prices, it's a good thing because it will reduce consumption, we don't want to produce any more gasoline."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/28/rick-santorum/santorum-accuses-romney-favoring-high-gas-prices-m/	How is Mitt Romney similar to Barack Obama? He likes high gas prices, according to rival Rick Santorum. Campaigning in Wisconsin ahead of the state primary, Santorum spoke to a crowd in Racine on March 25, 2012. In this video clip, he skewers Romney’s past statements on gasoline prices and what to do about them. "Who said, when he was governor of Massachusetts, we are going to have to live with high gas prices, it's a good thing because it will reduce consumption, we don't want to produce any more gasoline? That would be Mitt Romney," Santorum said. We decided to check whether that’s a fair paraphrase of Romney’s words. Romney’s words then Santorum’s campaign spokesman, Hogan Gidley, pointed us to a post on the conservative blog Poor Richard’s News from March 22, 2012. The blog post, as well as others in the Washington Post and the New Republic, unearthed a story from 2006 when Romney was governor of Massachusetts. Gas prices had risen that spring, and Romney and Lt. Gov. Kerry Healey were asked at a press conference about possible remedies. The two disagreed over suspending the state’s 23 ½ cent per gallon gas tax -- Healey favored it, while Romney said a tax break would only encourage more consumption. "I don’t think that now is the time, and I’m not sure there will be the right time, for us to encourage the use of more gasoline," Romney said, according to the Patriot Ledger in Quincy, Mass. Romney said he preferred to press for more fuel-efficient vehicles rather than reduce prices, the story said, and quoted Romney, "I’m very much in favor of people recognizing that these high gasoline prices are probably here to stay." An Associated Press story from the same press conference provided a longer quote from Romney: "I am very much in favor of people recognizing that these high gasoline prices are probably here to stay and that the appropriate action for us to take is to find ways to find fuel conservation," the AP wrote. Santorum’s words now Santorum attributed three different ideas to Romney: * Americans are going to have to live with high gas prices. * That's a good thing because it will reduce consumption. * America shouldn’t produce any more gasoline. The first is an accurate paraphrase. Romney said high prices are "probably here to stay." In the second one, Santorum is misstating what Romney said. Romney's statement wasn't a value judgment that high prices were beneficial. It was a practical argument in favor of finding ways to deal with high prices. In the third idea he attributed to Romney, that America shouldn't produce any more gasoline, Santorum veered off the path completely. Nowhere in the Patriot Ledger or Associated Press coverage does Romney (or anyone else) mention gasoline production or drilling. Our ruling Santorum said: "Who said, when he was governor of Massachusetts, we are going to have to live with high gas prices, it's a good thing because it will reduce consumption, we don't want to produce any more gasoline? That would be Mitt Romney." In 2006, during another fuel price spike, Romney said he believed high prices were "here to stay," and he struck a practical tone, suggesting that should lead to greater conservation and efficiency. He said there may never be a right time to push for more gas use. Those are points fairly summed up in Santorum’s remarks. But Romney didn't make a value judgment that high gas prices a "good thing." And he completely misrepresented Romney’s position when he said the former Massachusetts governor opposed increasing production. In the situation in 2006, Romney simply didn’t address that topic. On balance, we rate Santorum’s claim Half True.	None	Rick Santorum	None	None	None	2012-03-28T12:08:58	2012-03-25	['None']
pomt-08579	"The size of our federal government has more than doubled since the year 2000."	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2010/sep/27/scott-bruun/scott-bruun-says-federal-spending-has-doubled-2000/	Like many Republican candidates this year, Scott Bruun is hoping to beat Democratic incumbent Rep. Kurt Schrader by taking aim at government spending. Bruun says the country is awash in debt, weighed down by taxes, and spending money in a way that "insults drunken sailors." He also says this: "The size of our federal government has more than doubled since the year 2000.’’ First, it’s important to note that Bruun was referring to total spending. He made his comment in a statement on his campaign’s website in a longer discussion about federal spending. At first glance, it appears he is right. His campaign cited numbers from the federal Office of Management and Budget that show total federal spending in 2000 was $1.78 trillion. By 2009, spending increased to $3.5 trillion. So that’s about double in unadjusted dollars. But if you account for inflation, the spending total is $1.78 trillion in 2000 and goes to $2.29 trillion in 2009. That’s only a 29 percent increase. And other ways of measuring the size of the federal government also come up far short of "double." Robert Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, an independent think tank that studies federal spending and budgets, says the more accurate way to judge the government’s fiscal posture is to consider spending relative to the country’s gross domestic product, or GDP. That way, you’re getting a more holistic view since the calculation compares spending to the size of the overall economy. Using that approach, government spending as part of GDP went from 18.2 percent in 2000 to 24.7 percent in 2009. That increase is also far short of the doubling that Bruun claimed. Contrast those numbers to those hit during the peak of World War II -- 43.6 percent of GDP in both 1943 and 1944. It’s also worth looking at the size of the federal workforce, which has increased only slightly. The total federal personnel, which includes the military, has grown from 4.1 million in 2000 to 4.4 million in 2009. So that, too, is not close to double. So it’s quite a stretch for Bruun to make that claim. When you adjust the number for inflation, measure it as a percentage of GDP and check the size of the federal workforce, it is far short of double. We find his claim Barely True. Comment on this item. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-06058	Says the state tax burden per citizen in New York is twice as high as in Florida.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2012/jan/10/rick-scott/scott-says-new-yorkers-pay-twice-much-floridians-s/	Gov. Rick Scott, Florida's CEO in chief, often talks about making cold calls to companies in chilly cities as part of his effort to lure them here and create Florida jobs. In his second State of the State address, he called out the state of New York by name. "And I should add, to all of our friends in New York, come on down!" he said in the Jan. 10, 2012, speech, adding an unscripted shout-out to Illinois, too. "Our temperature outdoors is about twice as high as yours, and your (state) tax burden per citizen is about twice as high as ours. Those are good numbers for us." A clever play on words. But is he right? The U.S. Census Bureau keeps tabs on state tax collections each year. In 2010, New York's state taxes were $63.5 billion. Florida's state collections were half as low at $31.5 billion. Scott brought up the state's tax burden per citizen, which represents total tax collections divided by population. In 2010, New York's figure was $3,278, and Florida's was $1,675. State tax collection per capita in New York is very close to double, at about 97 percent more than Florida's, at least in 2010. By the way, part of the disparity between New York and Florida's tax collections is New York's personal income tax. Florida is one of seven states without one. Scott is right about the statistic, but the figure doesn't tell the whole story. For one, his measure does not factor in local taxes. That's important because Florida ranks highest in the country for its reliance on local taxes, which include property taxes. Using this measure, and 2009 figures, New York's tax collections would be about 90 percent more than Florida's, not 97 percent, said Kurt Wenner, Florida TaxWatch vice president of tax research. There are also different ways economists measure tax burden. Some use the per capita method, as cited by Scott, but others cite what portion of your income goes to pay taxes. That rate was 9.3 percent for state and local taxes in Florida in 2009 and 14.3 percent in New York, according to figures from TaxWatch, a business-backed policy group. The disparity is smaller using this method. A lower tax burden isn't the only way to measure the state of a state, though. As economists from the New York-based, left-leaning Fiscal Policy Institute pointed out, New York produced the country's second-fastest growth in gross domestic product, or GDP, in 2010. Florida trailed at 40th place. A similar dynamic played out in personal income growth: New York ranked second while Florida ranked 46th, according to a report generated by the Fiscal Policy Institute. "This raises the question about what relative tax burdens really mean: Does a lower tax burden mean a less dynamic, robust economy?" wrote James Parrott, deputy director and chief economist. "2010 data could suggest that." There are other factors to consider, too. Unemployment remains higher in Florida (10 percent as of November 2011) than New York (7.9 percent as of November 2011). Wages for the average working family are more in New York than in Florida by about $6,000, according to a 2009 study. And you could argue New Yorkers get more for their tax dollars in areas such as mass transit. Still, low taxes are attractive to many. "If people believe that Florida provides services to them that are as good as New York, or at least acceptable, than a lower tax burden could be attractive," said Mark Robyn, Tax Foundation economist. Our ruling Scott correctly cites that New York's state tax burden per person is twice as much as it is in Florida, and no doubt this fact could be attractive to businesses thinking of moving to Florida. But businesses likely consider more than just tax burden when thinking of where to locate their businesses, and some states with higher tax rates have more robust economies. Still, if you want to count Florida's positives for business, a low tax burden is surely one of them. We rate this Mostly True.

pomt-03881	Of $60 billion Congress approved in response to Hurricane Sandy, "only 10 percent was for disaster relief."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/mar/06/al-cardenas/al-cardenas-says-60b-congress-approved-after-hurri/	In the weeks since Congress approved aid for victims of Hurricane Sandy, conservatives have explained their opposition by saying the bill was loaded with political pork. Al Cardenas, the former chairman of the Republican Party of Florida who now heads the American Conservative Union, said the vast majority of the bill went beyond disaster relief. "Congress just adopted a $60 billion stimulus package, of which only 10 percent was for disaster relief. Now, I can't for the life of me understand why a good conservative would want to promote the $60 billion pork barrel bill, when in reality all we needed to do was approve a $10 billion disaster relief bill," Cardenas told MSNBC’s Morning Joe on March 1, 2013. Is it true that of the $60 billion, just 10 percent was for disaster relief? 10 percent Sandy, a hurricane so sprawling it's often called a "superstorm," hit the United States in late October, devastating parts of the Atlantic coast, particularly New York and New Jersey. A company that models risk for insurance companies estimated a few days after the storm insured losses of $10 billion to $20 billion and economic damage of $30 billion to $50 billion. The governors of New York and New Jersey requested billions in federal aid. But an emergency spending package died in the House in December 2012 in the breathless last hours of the 112th Congress, as lawmakers passed a deal to avert the fiscal cliff. Christie blamed House Speaker John Boehner. On Jan. 4, Congress passed a bill to increase the borrowing authority of the Federal Emergency Management Agency by $9.7 billion to process flood claims. On Jan. 28, it passed H.R. 152, a separate $50.5 billion package. Of that $50.5 billion, $17 billion went toward immediate Sandy aid, while $33.5 billion was for "near- and long-term assistance and mitigation," according to a Congressional Quarterly analysis. Nearly all the money was handled as emergency spending — conveniently allowing lawmakers to ignore caps on discretionary spending. It’s less clear, however, exactly how much of it was ultimately for "disaster relief" — a definition that changes depending on whom you ask. Still, potential spending for flood insurance alone — nearly $10 billion — was more than the 10 percent (or $6 billion) that Cardenas claimed. Add in the $17 billion that House Republicans called "immediate support to the victims and communities impacted by Hurricane Sandy" — aid such as emergency food assistance, Army Corps of Engineers repairs, disaster loans, small business grants, and training and employment services — and it totals at least 40 percent without even considering longer-term aid in the bill. President Barack Obama signed the bill into law on Jan. 29. We asked the American Conservative Union about Cardenas' comments. The 10 percent? "He misspoke," said Larry Hart, ACU’s director of government relations. "You can see in the next sentence, which uses the figure of $10 billion," Hart said. But our calculations show that number is also wrong. Did he mean the appropriations for flood insurance? Some part of the $17 billion package? "He was saying that the estimate was that there was about $10 billion in emergency aid needed," Hart said. "He was not doing a legal budget analysis of the bill." We pointed out that Cardenas had made similar comments in an email to Politico, saying the "$60-plus billion pork barrel bill" contained "only $9 billion in disaster assistance." We didn’t get any further explanation of the number. Instead, Hart maintained that "the exact figure is not the issue" and cited spending in the full $60.2 billion package that wasn’t "immediate disaster relief," such as: • $3.5 billion for the Corps of Engineers for future mitigation efforts to protect against climate change. • $17 billion in Community Development Block Grants for any states with disaster declarations since 2011, because of their history as "a political slush fund," especially since $2 billion was "to mitigate future risks, not existing damage." • $2 billion for U.S. Housing and Urban Development to be used for "long-term recovery … and economic revitalization." • $200 million for Health and Human Services "to be used at the discretion of the secretary." • $5.3 billion in transportation money that can be used for projects "related to reducing risk of damage from future disasters." Of course, on MSNBC, Cardenas didn’t specify "immediate" disaster relief. Still, Taxpayers for Common Sense identified billions in H.R. 152 that wasn’t Sandy-related, including $2 billion for the federal highway system and $25 million to improve weather forecasting. Steve Ellis, vice president of the nonpartisan budget group, pointed out that it’s hard to say what percentage of the emergency spending package will ultimately go for disaster relief. "I can't tell you what percent is disaster relief until I see where it gets spent," he said. A big portion of the $17 billion in "immediate" assistance, more than $5 billion, went to replenish FEMA’s disaster relief fund, which may fund relief from future disasters, Ellis said. It’s not yet clear where funding for some other agencies, such as Housing and Urban Development and the Army Corps of Engineers, will go. Meanwhile, of the $9.7 billion to authorize additional borrowing for FEMA’s flood insurance program, some could go toward relief from future disasters, he said. Still, Cardenas suggested just $6 billion of Congress’ aid package "was for disaster relief." But just the very narrow appropriations for FEMA’s disaster relief fund and flood insurance program more than double that number, even if it may not all go to Sandy victims. Our ruling Cardenas was specific with his numbers, but his own organization says he misspoke. Our math shows that the $15 billion for FEMA disaster relief and flood insurance alone are more than double what Cardenas claimed. And while Ellis raises some valid questions about how much of the $60 billion package will ultimately go to disaster relief, we find it will be significantly more than Cardenas said. We rate his statement False.	None	Al Cardenas	None	None	None	2013-03-06T16:44:05	2013-03-01	['United_States_Congress']
pomt-01464	The non-profit group Feeding America is lying when it claims "that one in five kids is fighting starvation daily" in the United States.	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/oct/01/william-benson-huber/ny-post-op-ed-rebuts-starving-children-claim-was-n/	September was an unusual month for the people who focus on whether Americans are getting enough food to keep them healthy. Early in the month, a Wall Street Journal contributor took the federal government to task for "distorting" the numbers on food insecurity. At the end of September, the New York Post carried an op-ed with the headline, Feeding America: ‘Public service' lies. Feeding America is a large nonprofit that raises money and secures food donations on behalf of food banks nationwide. The Post op-ed written by William Benson Huber zeroed in on the organization’s message in its public service announcements. Huber opened his op-ed with a quote from a radio ad, "People say I’m a pretty good kid. Why, in a country as rich as America, should I have to go to bed hungry?" The ads, writes Huber, "inform us of a horror we’d otherwise think impossible: America has so failed its children that 17 million — one in five — don’t have enough to eat. Except that, enjoyable as all this self-loathing might seem, it’s simply a fairy tale." Huber, who is a marketing consultant and not a full-time Post employee, then challenged Feeding America’s "nonsensical claim that one in five kids is fighting starvation daily." "The only basis for Feeding America’s claim comes from U.S. Department of Agriculture surveys in which heads of households were asked if at any time during a calendar year their children were a) unable to eat what they wanted; b) unable to eat in whatever quantity they wanted; c) forced to eat cheaper brands, or d) afraid their food supply might run out on any single day." In this fact-check, we focus on Huber’s statement that Feeding America misled the public when it said that "one in five kids is fighting starvation daily." As it turns out, we can find no evidence that Feeding America ever made that claim. We asked Huber, and he backed away from it. "The words they use about going to bed hungry seems to me to be starving," Huber said. "I applied that word to their language." Feeding America spokesman Ross Fraser told PunditFact that his organization is very careful with its language, and it never speaks of kids starving. "We say ‘facing hunger,’ or ‘at risk of hunger,’ or ‘on the precipice of hunger,’ " Fraser said. "Because the federal government’s data is not about hunger. It’s about food insecurity." We’ll get into the federal data in just a bit, but beyond denying that Feeding America speaks of starvation, Fraser also denied that his group ever used the line about kids going to bed hungry. "We don’t have any public service announcements that use that," Fraser said. Ellyn Fisher, a spokeswoman for the Ad Council, the corporate-backed nonprofit that distributes the announcements, was equally emphatic. "I have confirmed that we have never used the line you are referring to in a PSA," Fisher said. The radio and video segments we found on the Ad Council website did not contain the language Huber cited. Huber said he wrote it down but he was not able to provide any further proof. Our search of the Internet Archive, a massive compendium of audio, video and text posted on the Internet, also came up empty. Huber also named two celebrity spokeswomen for Feeding America, Paula Deen and Beyonce, that the organization said had not been part of its public service efforts. Huber later told us that Deen had done some work for New York food banks, but that, "strictly speaking I don't know if she had an audio PSA." Further, Huber acknowledged that in order to shorten the piece, he paraphrased the questions he drew from the Agriculture Department’s survey. Here are the actual statements and questions put to families: 1. "We relied on only a few kinds of low-cost food to feed our children because we were running out of money to buy food." Was that often, sometimes, or never true for you in the last 12 months? 2. "We couldn’t feed our children a balanced meal, because we couldn’t afford that." Was that often, sometimes, or never true for you in the last 12 months? 3. "The children were not eating enough because we just couldn’t afford enough food." Was that often, sometimes, or never true for you in the last 12 months? 4. In the last 12 months, did you ever cut the size of any of the children’s meals because there wasn’t enough money for food? 5. In the last 12 months, were the children ever hungry but you just couldn’t afford more food? 6. In the last 12 months, did any of the children ever skip a meal because there wasn’t enough money for food? 7. (If yes to question 6) How often did this happen—almost every month, some months but not every month, or in only 1 or 2 months? 8. In the last 12 months did any of the children ever not eat for a whole day because there wasn’t enough money for food? Number of children facing hunger To the casual reader, Feeding America’s claim that one in five children faces hunger might sound as though one in five kids actually goes hungry. The organization provides a more nuanced view on its website, and we wanted to lay out the numbers here. The summaries all go back to those USDA questions. The Agriculture Department staff told us that they order these questions by the severity of the situation they describe. The fifth question, about the children being hungry because of a lack of money, triggers the department's most worrisome category of "very low food security." In the latest survey, about 765,000, or 1 percent of all children, lived in families where the answer was "yes." The government uses the less severe category, "low food security," for children who live in families where, at the very least, a lack of money meant the kids couldn’t get a balanced meal during the last 12 months. The number of children in that group, plus the very low security group, is about 8.5 million, or about 11.7 percent of all children. The most commonly heard statistic, that one in five children live in food insecure households, refers to the 15.7 million kids that live in families in which, at the very least, anyone in the household of any age couldn’t afford a balanced meal at some point during the year. This includes adults and children. Deborah Frank, a pediatrician at the Boston University School of Medicine and member of the National Commission on Hunger, said many studies show that simply living in a low food security household is enough to undercut a child’s well being. "The hurt can be lasting, Frank said. "If it cuts into how much kids learn, if it makes them less healthy, and how healthy a baby they have, these are all ways that children are hurt by not having enough of the right kinds of food." Frank and Feeding America noted that the problem in America is less about children having enough calories, and more about the nutritional quality of the food they eat. Our ruling Huber said that Feeding America was lying when it said kids were starving in America. Huber acknowledged that "starving" was his word, not the nonprofit’s. The sentence about children "going to bed hungry" was essential to Huber’s argument, but we could find no evidence that Feeding America ever used that phrase. Feeding America also denied using that phrase. While Huber insisted it was accurate, he was unable to provide any evidence. One of the principles of PunditFact is that people who make factual claims are accountable for their words and should be able to provide evidence to back them up. Huber has none. As such, we rate the claim Pants on Fire.	None	William Benson Huber	None	None	None	2014-10-01T14:49:27	2014-09-28	['United_States']
pomt-09026	"Crime is down in Arizona."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/07/al-hunt/bloombergs-al-hunt-says-crime-down-arizona/	The debate about immigration often involves discussions about whether illegal immigrants cause more crime. The topic came up on ABC's This Week on July 4, 2010, when Al Hunt, the executive editor in Washington for Bloomberg News, criticized John McCain for the Republican senator's comments about crime in Arizona. McCain had explained his shift on immigration by saying, "The violence is incredibly high. The human smuggling and drug cartels are at a level of violence where 25,000 -- 23,000 Mexican citizens have been murdered in the last few years, 5,000 already this year. There's a level of violence which has increased to a significant degree, which makes the situation far different than it was in 2007" when the Senate last considered immigration reform. He added, "But I invite the president to come to the border, and he can see for himself the absolute necessity of getting our border secure before more violence spills over onto our side of the border... It is not the same as it was in 2007. And the people deserve not to have our ranchers murdered, not to have a deputy shot by a drug smuggler with an AK-47 in Pinal County. The situation has dramatically changed, and the statistics absolutely back that up." During the roundtable discussion on This Week, Hunt told host Jake Tapper: "I must say, John McCain, in his interview with you, Jake, that was extraordinary to say that crime is up there. He's talking about Mexico. Crime is down in Arizona. Every single academic study that's been done shows that immigrants commit fewer crimes." It is unclear whether McCain was suggesting that crime in Arizona was up because of illegal immigrants, but we were curious about Hunt's claim that crime in Arizona -- a state that ranks 6th for the estimated population of illegal immigrants -- was down. Because Hunt did not specify the types of crime, we'll examine all types. We checked the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports as well as data from Arizona's Department of Public Safety and found Hunt is correct that crime is down. From 2004 to 2008, data from Arizona's DPS shows a 23 percent drop in the overall crime rate, while the FBI's statistics on Arizona show a 19 percent drop. Although the FBI has not released all of the data on 2009, Arizona's statistics show the crime rate in 2009 dropped an additional 12 percent. "Crime has been going down, overall, in Arizona," said Tony LaRose, an associate professor of criminology at the University of Tampa, but he noted it has been a national trend for the past almost three decades." The trend holds even if you only measure violent crime, which James Alan Fox, a professor of criminology at Northeastern University, said is the type of crime people think of when discussing crime and illegal immigrants. The violent crime rate fell 11 percent from 2004 to 2008 in Arizona. Whether or not Hunt was correctly interpreting McCain's comments is outside of the scope of the claim, but he is right about Arizona crime going down. So we rate Hunt's claim True.

pomt-08769	On running a "civil and polite" campaign.	half flip	/georgia/statements/2010/aug/25/roy-barnes/georgia-gubernatorial-hopeful-roy-barnes-says-its-/	Former and would-be governor Roy Barnes declared recently that it's possible to do what few politicians dare try: run a "civil and polite" campaign. At the end of a Republican runoff rife with name-calling and false accusations, Barnes, a Democrat, gave morning anchors at Channel 2 Action News a homily on political civility "I think that you can show differences without being mean," Barnes said Aug. 11. "You know, it’s a Southern tradition to be civil and polite. There are differences, but they’re honorable people. And so just because we have differences doesn’t mean that we have to call each other names. "But we do have a responsibility to show the differences, and I think they do, too. As long as it’s done in a respectful way and one that’s not personal, I think that we can do that." Barnes has worked to live by his words, his campaign spokesman Emil Runge said. So Barnes thinks it's possible to run a respectful campaign. Has he run one? AJC PolitiFact Georgia pulled out its Flip-O-Meter, which we keep on our desk next to our Truth-O-Meter. Politicians commonly shift their positions over time, sometimes for good reasons. The Flip-O-Meter determines whether such a shift has taken place. In an earlier item, PolitiFact Georgia ruled a claim by Barnes that he ran an all-positive TV ad campaign during the Democratic primary as Mostly True. His eight commercials generally took on a positive tone. They did not single out or criticize specific primary opponents, although he did take jabs at the state Legislature. At the time, Barnes didn't have to go negative. He polled way ahead of his challengers, and it was to his advantage to keep his party unified while Republicans squabbled. Times have changed. Recent polls put Barnes either behind Republican nominee Nathan Deal or in a dead heat. And when candidates are behind, they tend to run negative commercials, political experts told AJC PolitiFact Georgia. Those experts agree with Barnes that it's important for a candidate to demonstrate how he differs from the competition. That's the whole point of campaigning. And if one candidate has serious, legitimate problems, his opposition should mention it. So what's negative campaigning? And how do you avoid it? It's hard to say, said Richard Lau, a political science professor at Rutgers University in New Jersey who has studied political messages for decades. "Negative" is often in the eye of the beholder, Lau said. The candidate making the unflattering accusations thinks he's telling the truth. His rival thinks he's the victim of a negative attack. Deal does. Deal campaign spokesman Brian Robinson said Barnes has run a "100 percent" negative television ad campaign since Deal clinched his party's nomination this month. Barnes' camp, however, thinks Georgians deserve to know about the issues the ads raise, Runge said. Further complicating things is that much of political rhetoric, even the milder stuff, is way out of line in everyday life. You'd think twice about telling a fellow parishioner at a church picnic that he has ethical problems. "You wouldn't say this face to face to a friend or acquaintance," said Charles Bullock, a political scientist at the University of Georgia. So AJC PolitiFact Georgia's yardstick is the etiquette of political discussion, not a church picnic. And we acknowledge there is a spectrum of ads that can be perceived as "negative" that includes outrageous, vicious lies on one end and legitimate comparisons at the other. Barnes' campaign has released three new TV commercials since the day of the runoff. In this item, we'll see whether he stays on the right side of the line. "The Newspaper Says" Barnes' first post-primary ad, "The Newspaper Says," came out Aug. 10, the day of the Republican gubernatorial runoff. "This great state is falling behind," an announcer begins. A finger clicks through what appear to be newspaper articles on a touch-screen tablet computer about mortgage foreclosures, an ethics investigation and job losses. The headlines come from actual articles. "Do we continue down the same path, with the same team that gave us ethics violations, teacher furloughs, tax breaks to special interests, homes foreclosed and misplaced priorities? Or do we work our way back?" the announcer asks. The ad is critical of "the same team" and "more of the same," but the announcer doesn't portray any individual or government body in a negative light. All the issues it raises are real and stated accurately. "Newspapers Deal" Barnes' second ad, released Aug. 13, is much like the first one. The finger's there. So's the touch-screen. It opens with the same words: "This great state is falling behind." But this one calls out Deal by name, accusing him of being "distracted" with "ethical charges" as the state suffers. The ad closes with "Nathan Deal: just more of the same." Deal's name appears on a rusty real estate-type 'For Sale' sign, which breaks and tumbles to the ground. This ad raises ethics accusations against Deal that are well established by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and other news organizations. The headlines it uses come from actual articles. The description of the complaints is mindful of the fact that while a congressional ethics investigation found that Deal possibly violated U.S. House rules, he resigned from Congress in March before any formal accusation was made. The ad's finale strays from an everyday definition of "polite," but overall, the ad is well-sourced and carefully worded. And former Secretary of State Karen Handel called Deal far worse in the Republican runoff. "Hiding" Barnes' "Hiding," released Aug. 18, is his most aggressive so far. It gives Deal a loopy sound effect: a slide whistle. "Roy Barnes released 25 years of tax returns. Online," it says. "Nathan Deal refuses to disclose his income taxes." A cutout of Deal's head appears. His eyes and nose peer over the words: "What is he hiding this time?" That slide whistle blows, and the rusty real estate sign breaks apart once more. Then comes the unflattering slogan from the last commercial: "Nathan Deal. Just more of the same." Deal declined to release his tax returns but may in the future. The ad also appears on a website PolitiFact Georgia found Friday, www.whatisdealhiding.com. It asks, "Did his backroom deals as a Congressman break the law as has been charged? We have a right to know." And it offers readers the chance to sign a petition. There are a couple of problems with this. "What is he hiding?" is insinuation. And the site treats accusations of "backroom deals" as fact. So is Barnes running a "polite" and "civil" campaign? All of Barnes' ads, even his most aggressive one, "Hiding," raise legitimate issues such as ethics accusations against Deal. For the most part, they portray those issues accurately. But as time has passed, the imagery and language show Barnes' campaign has changed in tone. Consider the slide whistle and the cutout of Deal's head and the "backroom deals" accusation. Our experts agreed that "The Newspaper Says" isn't negative. "Newspapers Deal" might be considered negative by Deal's camp, but it stuck to legitimate issues. "Hiding," however, is different. "That is verging on what I think most people would be calling a negative ad," Lau said. Barnes' ads are not nearly as nasty as those in the Republican gubernatorial runoff, but with each new TV commercial he has moved further from "civil and polite" territory. We give Barnes a Half Flip.	None	Roy Barnes	None	None	None	2010-08-25T06:00:00	2010-08-11	['None']
pomt-11532	"Breaking: four million Democrat votes just declared fraudulent."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/feb/15/politico-news/no-four-million-democrat-votes-were-not-declared-f/	There is no evidence that millions of votes by Democrats were tossed due to faulty voting machines, despite what a headline said on Facebook. "Breaking: four million Democrat votes just declared fraudulent," stated a Feb. 7 headline on The Politico News, a fake news website with a similar name to Politico, a real news website. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The story provides no evidence and repeats the same story posted by the satirical fake news website Reagan was Right, adding in a screenshot of Fox News’ Lou Dobbs. Several fake stories during the past couple of years have alleged voter fraud to the benefit of Democrats or involving undocumented immigrants following an election cycle in which Donald Trump repeatedly made ridiculous statements about voter fraud. After being sworn into office, Trump continued to falsely claim substantial evidence of voter fraud. Voter fraud does happen, but not to the widespread amount that Trump has alleged. The Politico News story said that voting machines in 11 states have been declared "compromised" as a result of a software glitch — and as a result, the story says, "17 elections involving ballot referendums for free entitlements for immigrants, legalized marijuana and decriminalizing heroin overdoses should be overturned." The story said that the company that owns the machines, Novus Ordo Seclorum, INC, is owned by a group of Democrats including George Soros, Chelsea Clinton, Barack and Michelle Obama, and the estate of John Kennedy. According to LinkedIn, Novus Ordo Seclorum was a Delaware consulting firm formed in 2010 to help identify strengths and weaknesses in businesses. Its profile makes no mention of voting machines. It’s unclear if the company still exists; the website was a dead link and the voicemail for the phone number was full. Not surprisingly for a made-up story, we found no evidence that the company is owned by the high-profile Democrats it mentioned. Brenda Bowser Soder, U.S. Election Assistance Commission spokeswoman, told PolitiFact that Novus Ordo Seclorum doesn’t make voting machines and that the story is inaccurate.

pomt-11636	California is 41st in the nation in per pupil K-12 spending, but "No. 1 in per prisoner" spending.	mostly true	/california/statements/2018/jan/17/delaine-eastin/does-california-rank-41st-student-spending-no-1-pr/	Democratic candidate for governor Delaine Eastin wants to reduce California’s high poverty and incarceration by investing more in students. Eastin, a former state legislator and superintendent of public instruction, recently said California doesn’t spend enough on students at its K-12 schools but spends more than any state in the nation on its inmates. "Ladies and gentlemen, you are living in the most expensive state in the union, but you are 41st in per pupil spending," Eastin claimed at a Los Angeles town hall for six gubernatorial candidates on Jan. 13, 2018. "You should be in the top 10 not the bottom 10," she added. "But guess what, you’re No. 1 in per prisoner expenditure. That’s a disgrace. Budgets are statements of values. And to look at our budget, you’d think prisons were more important than education." Eastin makes her claim at about the 46:00 minute mark in the town hall. Was Eastin right about those rankings? We decided to fact check her per student vs. per prisoner spending comparison. 41st in per student spending? To support the first part of the statement, Eastin’s campaign pointed to a January 2017 report by the California Budget and Policy Center. The nonprofit, which is described in some media reports as left-leaning, analyzes how budget and tax policies affect low- and middle-income Californians. Its report found "California ranked 41st among all states in spending per K-12 student after adjusting for differences in the cost of living in each state." It used data from the 2015-16 fiscal year. California schools spent $10,291 per K-12 student that year, or about $1,900 less than the $12,252 per student spent by the nation as a whole, the report said. Notably, California’s per student spending was up about $2,000 from the 2012-13 fiscal year, when the state ranked 50th in the nation. Jonathan Kaplan, the report’s author and a senior policy analyst at the center, told us the report applies a wage-based index to account for California’s high teacher salaries. This adjustment, he said, allows for a valid spending comparison between states that pay employees much less. Clarifications missing Eastin’s statement does not clarify that the 41st in the nation ranking includes an adjustment for cost-of-living. Nor does she mention that California’s per pupil spending has moved up the rankings in recent years. The budget center is not the only group that ranks per pupil spending. EdWeek, a publication that covers K-12 education, ranked California 46th in per student spending, also using a cost of living adjustment. It’s most recent ranking, however, uses older data, from 2013-14, that doesn’t account for recent state spending increases. By contrast, the National Education Association conducts a straight spending comparison. It placed California’s per pupil spending at 22nd for 2015-16. In February 2017, EdSource.org published an in-depth look at the ways California’s per pupil spending has been ranked by different groups. It summarized its findings this way: "Since 2011-12, the low point in funding following the 2007-08 recession, California has increased K-12 funding by more than $20 billion. As a result, its average per-student spending has significantly increased, and its ranking among the states has improved in the three most frequently cited studies. But there’s a big variation in the state’s ranking among the three because they use different methods and different data. California has moved up some but continues to be in the bottom fifth of states, according to Education Week and the California Budget and Policy Center, while the National Education Association places California near the middle." Per prisoner spending To support Eastin’s claim that California is "No. 1 in per prisoner expenditure," her campaign directed us to a June 2017 Associated Press article that describes those costs as "the nation’s highest." It said California’s per-inmate cost was expected to climb to $75,560 in the next year. "Since 2015, California’s per-inmate costs have surged nearly $10,000, or about 13%. New York is a distant second in overall costs at about $69,000," the AP reported. In August 2017, PolitiFact California rated Mostly True Sen. Kamala Harris’ claim "it costs $75,000 per year" to lock up an inmate in the state, based in part on the AP article and state budget estimates. We found several reasons for the dramatic cost increase. Most notable is California’s sharp drop in inmates combined with higher corrections spending, resulting from greater state contributions to prison employee pensions. The inmate drop is driven by a 2009 U.S. Supreme Court order for California to reduce prison overcrowding. California’s prison population reached a peak of 163,000 inmates in 2006, according to the Public Policy Institute of California. The state estimates it will house an average of about 119,000 prisoners this year. Meanwhile, there’s been no corresponding reduction in prison staff as inmate number have fallen, causing per capita costs to spike. Jeffrey Callison, a state prisons spokesman, told us the conditions of the court order prevent California from closing prisons even as the inmate population is reduced. "So long as the order is in effect we cannot close prisons because to do so would reduce our capacity, thereby pushing us back above 137.5 percent" level of prison crowding, Callison said in an email. That level is tied to prison capacity and defined by the court, he said. Prisoner cost to keep climbing Looking ahead, the per inmate cost is expected to go up again -- to $80,729 -- under Gov. Jerry Brown’s proposed 2018-19 budget released this month. PolitiFact California could not immediately obtain current per prisoner cost estimates for the state of New York. Various rankings have listed New York as No. 1 for per prisoner costs, including a Vera Institute of Justice report using the earlier 2015 data. Christian Henrichson, research director at the Vera Institute, told us by email that California and New York "are neck and neck on this measure, and the answer may depend on the year studied." California’s continued per prisoner cost spike "would place CA in the top spot," Jon Murchinson, Eastin’s campaign spokesman, asserted in an email. While we don’t have all the exact figures, that’s a fairly safe bet. Though per capita inmate costs continue to climb, that doesn’t mean California spends more on prisons than K-12 education, as some might take from Eastin’s claim. The reverse is correct: Gov. Jerry Brown’s current general fund budget projects spending 42 percent, or $55 billion, on the K-12 system. Meanwhile, it proposes spending 9 percent, or about $12 billion, on the prison system. Our ruling Candidate for governor Delaine Eastin recently claimed California ranks 41st in per pupil K-12 spending but is "No. 1 in per prisoner" spending. She relied on a January 2017 policy center report that backs up the per pupil spending ranking, after adjusting for cost of living. Another ranking that makes a straight spending comparison puts California at 22nd for per pupil spending. Eastin did not make this clear in her statement nor did she note that California’s per student spending has increased in recent years. Eastin’s claim that California is No. 1 for per prisoner costs is backed up by a 2017 Associated Press report, which listed New York a distant second. While we could not immediately find current figures for New York, we discovered that California’s per prisoner costs are expected to again rise -- to more than $80,000 -- in the next fiscal year, several thousand dollars higher than in recent years. Overall, Eastin’s comparison is supported by recent studies. But her statement could use clarifying information. We rate it Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. UPDATE: After publication, we added additional context noting the U.S. Supreme Court order prevents California from automatically closing prisons even as its inmate population is reduced.

pomt-05854	"Senator Menendez said he would spend our money wisely. But our annual national deficit climbed from $250 billion a year to $1.6 trillion on his watch."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/feb/13/joseph-kyrillos/gop-challenger-joseph-kyrillos-blames-us-sen-rober/	U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez is one of hundreds of federal officials responsible for spending taxpayer dollars, but state Sen. Joseph Kyrillos is pinning blame for the nation’s rising annual deficits on the Democratic incumbent. Kyrillos, a Republican representing part of Monmouth County, made that accusation during a Feb. 1 speech announcing his plans to seek the GOP nomination and challenge Menendez, who is seeking re-election. "Senator Menendez said he would spend our money wisely," Kyrillos told the crowd at the Lincroft Inn. "But our annual national deficit climbed from $250 billion a year to $1.6 trillion on his watch." For this fact-check, PolitiFact New Jersey is tackling two related claims made by Kyrillos. The first claim concerns the specific budgetary figures that he cited, and the second claim deals with whether it’s fair to blame Menendez for those deficits. We found that Menendez bears some responsibility for the increased deficits, but Kyrillos’ numbers are slightly off and his argument ignores the impact of the recession on federal coffers. First, let’s talk about the deficit figures. Kyrillos spokesman Chapin Fay claimed that the annual deficit increased from about $250 billion in fiscal year 2006 -- when Menendez joined the Senate -- to about $1.6 trillion in fiscal year 2011, which ended in September 2011. The number for fiscal year 2006 is accurate, but the fiscal year 2011 figure cited by Kyrillos is not. Federal officials had estimated an annual deficit of $1.645 trillion for fiscal year 2011, but the actual deficit turned out to be slightly under $1.3 trillion. During Menendez’s tenure in the Senate, the annual deficit reached its highest level in fiscal year 2009, at about $1.4 trillion. Now, let’s turn to the larger question: how much did Menendez have to do with the rising deficits? With regard to the spending increase in fiscal year 2009, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office pointed to three major factors: the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the stimulus); the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP; and payments to mortgage guarantee agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Following its inception, TARP provided federal dollars to financial institutions and automakers. Menendez voted for the three bills that led to increased spending under those measures. But two professors with expertise in federal budgeting also pointed to another major factor behind the rising deficits: the recession. The economic downturn caused a steep drop in revenues at a time when more people were seeking unemployment benefits. "But I think it is silly to blame an individual Senator for changes that were fundamentally driven by the worst recession since the 1930s," Alan Auerbach, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said in an e-mail. Daniel Mitchell, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, also said Kyrillos was giving Menendez "too much blame." Menendez deserves some blame, but members of both parties contributed to the increased deficits. "It’s been a bipartisan problem with all of them going along with it," Mitchell told us. Fay said Kyrillos believes both parties contributed to the deficit, but maintained that Menendez’s voting record was a significant factor. "The deficit has risen dramatically during Sen. Menendez's time in office - and as you cited yourself, he has taken an extraordinary number of votes during that time to increase spending," Fay said in an email. A spokeswoman for Menendez declined to comment. Our ruling During his campaign announcement, Kyrillos criticized Menendez by saying "our annual national deficit climbed from $250 billion a year to $1.6 trillion on his watch." His numbers are slightly off, because the highest annual deficit during Menendez’s tenure in the Senate was about $1.4 trillion in fiscal year 2009. Menendez bears some responsibility for the large deficits by supporting various measures such as the stimulus and TARP. But experts told us the recession largely contributed to the deficits, and both parties are to blame for increased spending. We rate the statement Half True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-06563	Says she helped lead the launch of curbside recycling.	half-true	/oregon/statements/2011/oct/01/mary-nolan/should-mary-nolan-get-credit-curbside-recycling-po/	Before Mary Nolan was a state legislator running for Portland City Council, she worked many years for the city of Portland. While there, she was in charge of two departments: sewers and public works maintenance. Nolan is not shy about bringing up the municipal part of her resume. The following is listed on her campaign website and on her Facebook campaign page: "As the head of the Bureau of Environmental Services and earlier as Director of Public Works Maintenance, she helped lead landmark improvements in protecting the Willamette River and environment, launching curbside recycling, repairing Portland roads and bridges, and managing public resources to save millions of dollars while bringing projects in on-time and on-budget." That’s a lot of landmark public deeds to absorb. So we’ll focus on just one of her cited accomplishments: Did Nolan help lead the launch of curbside recycling? Portland residents started recycling from their homes in the late 1980s, back before Nolan entered the recycling scene. In 1983, the state mandated that cities offer the service to residential customers. Portland adopted a system effective June 1, 1987. But it was a free-market system with multiple haulers servicing the same blocks and recycling results were scattered. The companies picked up newspapers weekly and metal, glass and cardboard monthly. In short, the initial system wasn’t very effective. In February 1992, the city rolled out a new residential recycling program. Households received two bins for recyclables. Milk jugs and magazines were added to mix. But here’s the critical difference: Haulers were allocated their own section of the city, and they were required to collect recycling every week, the same day as trash collection. "The overhaul that was instituted in 1992, it was game changing. It was a fundamental shift," says Bruce Walker, the city’s solid waste and recycling manager who was back then part of a small team charged with making the change happen. His boss at the Bureau of Environmental Services, which managed recycling at the time, was Sue Keil. Keil said she had been tapped by then-Commissioner Earl Blumenauer to oversee the new recycling system. Nolan, tapped to lead the bureau in mid-1990, was Keil’s boss. "Certainly Mary was not, as you say, involved in the day-to-day decision making, but I was talking to her about it, and it was on her watch," Keil said. "It’s entirely fair to say this happened on her watch and with her support." In a similar PolitiFact, we gave Portland mayoral candidate Charlie Hales a True for saying that he led on the issue of racially diversifying the Fire Bureau in the early 1990s. As the elected commissioner in charge of the bureau, Hales hired a new fire chief to come to Portland and shake up the bureau. We found that Hales was correct to claim credit. Nolan, on the other hand, was not a commissioner in charge. She was a bureau director carrying out the order of a commissioner and city council. And on the flip side, Nolan wasn’t even the person directly responsible for revamping the recycling system. That person was Sue Keil. It’s hard for us to let Nolan take credit when she was neither an elected official or civic body giving the order, nor the person handling day-to-day duties. Let’s also remember that Portland had a curbside recycling system before Nolan. We know it was clumsy and disorganized and hardly resembled what we have today, but the word "launch" makes it sound as if she initiated curbside recycling. Nolan says she "helped lead landmark improvements in … launching curbside recycling." We find this statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-15173	"Last year, we had zero percent growth in GDP in Virginia ...The only states that did worse than us were Alaska and Mississippi."	true	/virginia/statements/2015/aug/25/glen-sturtevant/glen-sturtevant-says-virginia-had-zero-percent-gro/	Virginia needs a dose of Republican economic medicine to get out of a funk, says Glen Sturtevant, a Richmond School Board member who is running for the state Senate. "Last year, we had zero percent growth in GDP in Virginia -- zero percent," Sturtevant said during an Aug. 18 candidates forum, sponsored by WCVE Richmond Public Radio. "The only states that did worse than us were Alaska and Mississippi." Sturtevant is seeking the 10th District Senate seat that long has been held by Republican John Watkins, who is not seeking reelection. Also running is Dan Gecker, a Democrat who serves on the Chesterfield County Board of Supervisors; Marleen Durfee, an independent who is a former Chesterfield supervisor; and Carl Loser, a Libertarian from Powhatan County. We wondered whether Sturtevant’s dreary economic statistics were correct. A spokesman for his campaign said the information came from a June article in The Washington Post about preliminary state gross domestic product figures for 2014 that were released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis at the U.S. Department of Commerce. GDP is the value of all finished goods and services produced. Virginia’s GDP of about $427 billion last year was indeed flat -- there was 0.0 percent inflation-adjusted growth from 2013. Only two states trailed the Old Dominion in growth: Mississippi and Alaska, which saw their state economies shrink. Nationally, inflation-adjusted GDP expanded by 2.2 percent last year. These figures are preliminary, and Virginia’s position might improve slightly when the bureau releases its final report in September. Last year, for example, the preliminary report ranked Virginia 49th in economic growth in 2013; the final ranking pegged Virginia’s growth at 0.4 percent, 43rd among the states. The commonwealth’s economic growth has been lackluster for several years, spanning Democratic and Republican governors. In 2011, the state saw 0.6 percent GDP growth; in 2012, it saw 0.7 percent growth. Economists we spoke with said Virginia’s low numbers largely reflect a slow recovery from the Great Recession that has been exacerbated by its dependence on federal spending in an era of budget cuts. Virginia is home to large military bases and a fleet of defense and government contractors and federal workers that drive the economy of Northern Virginia. The Pew Charitable Trusts estimates that in 2013, federal spending was responsible for about 31 percent of Virginia’s economic activity. Only Mississippi was more dependent. Under the federal sequestration compromise, which kicked in at the start of 2013, Congress and the White House agreed to an automatic series of budget cuts to trim the national debt by $1 trillion over nine years. Half of the savings are coming from defense spending and half from domestic programs. A 2013 study by Stephen Fuller, director of the Center of Regional Analysis at George Mason University, said Virginia was "particularly vulnerable" to sequestration and predicted it would bite $15.4 billion a year out of the state’s economy. That was the second largest of any state. Fuller found California was projected to lose $16.7 billion. Texas was third, projected to lose $11.9 billion annually. Both of those states are seeing much greater growth than Virginia: Texas ranked second in the nation last year, with 5.2 percent growth; California ranked ninth with 2.8 percent growth. It should be noted, however, that both states have larger, more diverse economies than Virginia. California’s GDP was $2.1 trillion last year, Texas’ was $1.5 trillion, and Virginia’s was $427 billion, according to Bureau of Economic Analysis figures. Maryland, where many federal employees live, ranked 36th in economic growth last year. Although Maryland also is home to many federal employees, it’s less dependent on federal spending than Virginia. According to Pew, Uncle Sam funds about 27.5 percent of the economic activity in Maryland. While federal cuts start the discussion about Virginia’s sluggish recovery from the recession, they’re not the whole conversation. The state has also been hurt by the sagging coal industry in Southwest Virginia and declining furniture manufacturing in Southside Virginia, according to Terry Terry Rephann, regional economist at the University of Virginia’s Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service. Our ruling Sturtevant said that Virginia had zero percent economic growth last year, the third worst result in the nation. We rate his statement True.

pomt-12948	Says Vicks VapoRub caused a child’s death.	false	/global-news/statements/2017/jan/06/blog-posting/parenting-blog-falsely-claims-vicks-vaporub-was-fa/	Here’s a scary story. A mother in Mexico thinks that her 2-year-old has a cold and puts Vicks VapoRub on his chest and under his nose. She lies down next to him and when she wakes, she finds the child dead. The tale began moving through the Web in November. Smag31.com, a website that targets young mothers, carried it on Nov. 25 with the headline, "Mom applies a remedy to her baby, moments later he dies." But so far as anyone can tell, the story is untrue. Vicks VapoRub has been tied to breathing problems in infants and toddlers, but not to any deaths. The post was flagged by Facebook users as part of the social media giant’s crackdown on fake news. Bruce Rubin, chair of the Department of Pediatrics at Virginia Commonwealth University, has followed questions about Vicks VapoRub for a decade. In 2009, he published a peer-reviewed article based on a case he had encountered a few years before. The parents of an 18-month-old had put Vicks under the child’s nose and the child immediately stopped breathing. They quickly turned the child upside down, slapped it on the back and it coughed up a plug of mucus. Its breathing returned to normal. But Rubin told us that in the 10 years since that case, he’s seen no report of any deaths. On the other hand, episodes of breathing distress while rare, are not unheard of. "I understand that there have been about 30 such reports, all with Vicks under the nose of very small children," Rubin said. "Procter and Gamble (the maker of Vicks) specifically states never to use this directly under the nose at any age, and never use at all in children under the age of 2." To underscore, that is what the label says. Never under the nose. Never with kids under 2. A 2012 study looked at what happens when menthol, one of Vicks’ active ingredients, is inhaled. It found that the body responds by making more mucus, but again, the authors cited no example of a child actually dying. Jennifer Lowry, head of toxicology at Children’s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City and chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ environmental health council, said, "I have never heard, nor could I find a report of, a patient dying from inhaling Vicks VapoRub." Lowry said as a pediatric medical toxicologist, she has concerns about any product that contains camphor, as Vicks does. But her main worry is that parents will do exactly the wrong thing and have kids eat it. That’s very dangerous. Procter and Gamble spokeswoman Velvet Gogol Bennett said the company has never had a family report a fatality due to inhaling Vicks VapoRub. "We have had no local health authority notification, no hospital notification, nor any doctor or any official news organization anywhere in the world has brought this case to our attention," Bennett said. "Despite all of our efforts to investigate this social media posting, there is no verifiable information in terms of city and name of the person concerned." The blog post about the alleged death said, "The medical report stated the child died due to inflammation in the respiratory track, produced by the camphor contained in the famous ointment." If such a medical report exists, no researcher we contacted seems to have ever seen it. We reached out to the author behind the blog and did not hear back. The myth-busting website Snopes also looked into this and found it lacked substance. A Canadian study looked at cases of children eating Vicks or similar products. Those situations sent children to the emergency room, but were not fatal. The one exception was in 1983 involving a child with pneumonia whose parents had given him a home remedy that contained camphor and alcohol. Rubin said if people follow instructions, Vicks is fine: "If you are an adult with a stuffy head cold, putting Vicks on your chest and drinking some hot tea with honey (and perhaps rum) is as good a medicine as it gets. Just keep the Vicks (and the rum) away from the under-2 crowd." Our ruling A blog post said that Vicks VapoRub caused a child’s death in Mexico. While the product has been tied to breathing problems in infants and toddlers, there is no evidence that it has been fatal. We rate this claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a56cc01f-fabc-4887-83e9-b9eb2a163b40	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2017-01-06T11:54:00	2016-11-25	['None']
pomt-14753	"Mike Morell testified and told Congress that the reason Obama has not bombed ISIS' oil fields is they're concerned about global warming."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/14/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-misquotes-cia-official-makes-false-claim-/	Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz tore into President Barack Obama’s strategy against ISIS in an NPR interview. Cruz, who vowed to "utterly destroy ISIS" and "carpet bomb them into oblivion," said Obama is not serious about defeating the jihadists. The Texas senator brought up Obama’s former CIA deputy director, Mike Morell, to show how Obama has prioritized a green agenda instead. "Mike Morell testified and told Congress that the reason Obama has not bombed ISIS' oil fields is they're concerned about global warming," Cruz said on Dec. 8’s Morning Edition. "This is nonsense." Is it true that Morell said the Obama administration refused to strike ISIS’ oil assets because of fears that emissions from oil fires will contribute to global warming, the term for increased temperatures believed to be linked to human activity? Not exactly. Cruz gets several details wrong, starting with what Morell said and where he said it. His overall point is misleading and, in the words of one expert, "completely nonsensical." Bombs and black gold We’ll start with an overview of ISIS’ oil assets and what’s been bombed. ISIS has hijacked the bulk of Syria’s oil, which has become a major cash cow for the terrorist group’s operations. (Other prominent sources of revenue include taxation and extortion, sales of looted property, bank robberies, kidnapping ransoms and state-run businesses.) With about a half-dozen oil fields under its control, ISIS churns out an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 barrels per day and makes $1.5 million to $2 million daily from oil sales. U.S. and coalition military forces have been trying to get at this revenue source by periodically targeting oil assets for over a year. From the start of the operation against ISIS in August 2014 to Nov. 13, 2015, airstrikes have damaged or destroyed 260 oil infrastructure targets, according to the Defense Department. These strikes were initially aimed at easy targets like mobile refineries and storage depots, and not entirely successful, a Pentagon official admitted. So attacks were ramped up to focus on more sensitive targets like tanker trucks and wellheads. In October 2015, the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS launched a second campaign specifically aimed to cut two-thirds of the terrorists’ oil revenue. By Dec. 1, military forces had destroyed wells, processing facilities and nearly 400 ISIS oil trucks, according to Defense Secretary Ash Carter. "We've seen the U.S. get a lot more creative and aggressive with its target list," said Matthew Reed, vice president of Foreign Reports, a Washington-based consultant firm specializing in Middle East oil politics. "It has had to overcome a learning curve. It's still learning what to hit and where." Misquoting Morell? Did a top CIA official admit that these attacks were limited because of climate change concerns? The Cruz campaign didn't get back to us. Our search of congressional transcripts did not turn up any instance of Morell giving congressional testimony on this point. Cruz could be thinking of comments by Morell on PBS’ Charlie Rose on Nov. 23. Here’s what Morell said: Morell: "So prior to Paris, there seemed to be a judgment — I don’t sit in the Sit. Room (sic) anymore — but there seemed to have been a judgment that, look, we don't want to destroy these oil tankers because that's infrastructure that's going to be necessary to support the people when ISIS isn't there anymore. "And it's going to create environmental damage. And we didn't go after oil wells — actually hitting oil wells that ISIS controls because we didn't want to do environmental damage and we didn’t want to destroy that infrastructure." Rose: "So we’re hitting oil on trucks." Morell: "So now we're hitting oil on trucks. And maybe you get to the point where you say we also have to hit oil wells. So those are the kind of tough decisions you have to make." Cruz flubs Morell’s comments in a few ways. First, Morell was talking about oil tankers and wells under ISIS’ control, not "oil fields." That term can refer to the underground reservoirs of petroleum or the broader oil infrastructure sitting atop (i.e. refineries, tanks and other collection and transportation equipment). As we noted, military forces have been hitting some oil assets. Second, Morell made no mention of global warming. Instead, he said the oil tankers and wells were spared out of concern for "environmental damage." Based on previous comments by Pentagon officials and experts we talked to, Morell was more likely referring to oil spills and destroying the local environment. That’s a far cry from climate change. Limitations and concerns The attacks on ISIS oil have been limited by many concerns. But based on statements by Pentagon officials and experts, the list doesn’t include global warming. The first attacks, for example, were aimed at damaging, not completely destroying, mobile refineries and other equipment in order to keep the infrastructure intact for an ISIS-less future, not out of environmental concerns. "We'd like to preserve the flexibility for those refineries to still contribute to a stable economy in what we hope will be a stable country when the Assad regime is not in control anymore," a Pentagon spokesperson told reporters in September 2014, adding that the attacks may have actually caused some oil fires. Oil wells and tanker trucks were initially off limits in order to avoid civilian casualties, according to news reports. Even when these became fair game in October 2015, permanent destruction still wasn’t the goal. "We have to be cognizant that there will be a time after the war -- the war will end," another Pentagon spokesperson said in November 2015. "So we don't want to completely and utterly destroy these facilities to where they’re irreparable." Experts told us this policy is humanitarian and tactical. Injuring or killing civilians or crippling the economy would be counterproductive to the goal of isolating the enemy from the local population, said Ben Bahney, an analyst at the RAND Corporation, a global policy think tank. "The Pentagon doesn't care about ISIS' carbon footprint," Reed of Foreign Reports said. "They do care about how airstrikes impact locals who are trapped inside ISIS territory. Because the potential for environmental and humanitarian disaster is so high, the U.S. uses precision strikes." That’s precisely why bombing the physical oil fields themselves would be a "terrible idea," said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. The ecological fallout, health hazards and permanently weakened economy would impact local people. "If it were just global warming, we would obviously bomb them," he said. "If you’re worried about climate change, you should be stopping oil production period. If you bomb the well heads, you prevent the oil from being extracted so that would actually help reduce emissions," Bahney said. "Cruz’s claim is completely nonsensical." The Cruz campaign did not respond to requests for comment. Our ruling Cruz said, "Mike Morell testified and told Congress that the reason Obama has not bombed ISIS' oil fields is they're concerned about global warming." We found no instances of Morell testifying before Congress on this point. He did talk about Obama’s ISIS strategy on PBS, but Cruz misquotes what he said. Morell said U.S. military forces spared oil tankers and wells — not "oil fields" — in order to avoid "environmental damage." Preserving the environment for the local population is quite different from global warming, which no officials have brought up as a deterrent from bombing ISIS. The U.S. military has been striking oil assets but it has limited those strikes out of concern for civilian casualties, destroying the oil infrastructure and doing damage to the local environment. If climate change was the Obama administration’s top priority, experts said, it would make more sense to bomb the oil fields. We rate Cruz’s claim False.

pomt-06499	"Our unemployment rate has been higher than 8 percent for more than two-and-a-half years, far above what the Obama Administration promised with the 'stimulus.' "	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2011/oct/13/john-boehner/john-boehner-says-obama-promised-stimulus-would-ke/	After the U.S. Department of Labor released a report showing unemployment held steady at 9.1 percent in September, House Speaker John Boehner said it showed the need to "find common ground on common-sense solutions to create a better environment for private-sector job creation." The Ohio Republican also repeated a worn but sturdy talking point that his office used to headline his statement: "Our unemployment rate has been higher than 8 percent for more than two-and-a-half years, far above what the Obama Administration promised with the 'stimulus,' " Boehner said. The claim that the White House "promised" the stimulus would keep unemployment under 8 percent has been popular among Republican critics of the stimulus. PolitiFact first checked it in July 2009 when then House Republican Whip Eric Cantor said: "We were promised. The president said we would keep unemployment under 8.5 percent (if the stimulus passed)." PolitiFact rated his claim Mostly False. Since the House speaker has raised it anew, PolitiFact Ohio thought a reprise of our reviews was worthwhile. The claim is rooted in a report called "The Job Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan" from Christina Romer, then chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, the vice president's top economic adviser. It was issued on Jan. 9, 2009, before President Barack Obama took office. The report projected that Obama’s proposed stimulus plan would create 3 million to 4 million jobs by the end of 2010. The report also predicted unemployment rates with and without the stimulus. A chart in the report shows that without the stimulus (the baseline), unemployment was projected to hit about 8.5 percent in 2009 and then continue rising to a peak of about 9 percent in 2010. With the stimulus, they predicted the unemployment rate would peak at just under 8 percent in 2009. In fact, the unemployment rate went higher. It peaked at just over 10 percent in early 2010 and remains stuck above 9 percent. But do those projections from the administration in January 2009 constitute a promise? They certainly came with heavy disclaimers. "It should be understood that all of the estimates presented in this memo are subject to significant margins of error," the report states. "There is the more fundamental uncertainty that comes with any estimate of the effects of a program. Our estimates of economic relationships and rules of thumb are derived from historical experience and so will not apply exactly in any given episode. Furthermore, the uncertainty is surely higher than normal now because the current recession is unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity." There's also a footnote with the chart that states: "Forecasts of the unemployment rate without the recovery plan vary substantially. Some private forecasters anticipate unemployment rates as high as 11 percent in the absence of action." The administration acknowledged its projections were wrong. In a July 2, 2009, interview, Romer said on Fox: "None of us had a crystal ball back in December and January. I think almost every private forecaster realized that there were other things going on in the economy. It was worse than we anticipated." Indeed, in January 2009, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected the unemployment rate would climb to 8.3 percent in 2009 and peak at 9 percent in 2010. By February, the prediction was even higher — 9 percent in 2009 without the stimulus, and 7.7 to 8.5 percent with a stimulus. In a White House news conference on June 8, 2009, Bernstein said the projections made in January were off because economic numbers for fourth-quarter 2008 weren't yet available. When they were released, they revealed the economy was in worse shape than economists realized, losing 600,000 to 800,000 jobs a month. Bernstein maintained in that news conference that the stimulus was working, and that the unemployment rate would be even worse without it. Is the fact that unemployment rose, even as the stimulus unfolded, proof that it has failed? White House officials have steadfastly maintained that, even though the unemployment rate has risen higher than projected in January 2009, it would be even worse if not for the stimulus. Many independent economists agree with Obama that the stimulus created more than a million jobs and kept the unemployment rate from going even higher than it has (though in fairness, not every economist agrees with that). Obama warned upon taking office that if "dramatic action" were not taken, "the unemployment rate could reach double digits," with the recession lasting for years. But PolitiFact could find no evidence of anyone in the administration making a public pledge that the stimulus would keep the unemployment rate below 8 percent. When we asked Boehner's office what evidence he had, they provided a number of sources that confirmed the prediction. Those included a reference to Rep. Barney Frank -- a Democrat and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee -- saying that Obama and Democrats were saddled with a "false prediction" and that making the prediction "was a dumb thing to do." There is an element of truth in Boehner’s statement. A report prepared by the incoming Obama administration did project that the unemployment rate would peak at just under 8 percent in 2009. It has been above 8 percent since early in 2009. We think it's a big stretch to call an economic projection a "promise." The administration never characterized it that way and included plenty of disclaimers saying the predictions had "significant margins of error" and a higher degree of uncertainty due to a recession that is "unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity." Those are critical facts that the speaker’s claim ignores. As we have ruled for others who have made this claim, we rate Boehner’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-12764	"Studies have shown Latinos are more than 40 percent less likely to call 911 when they have been a victim of a crime."	mostly true	/california/statements/2017/feb/24/kamala-harris/mostly-true-latinos-40-percent-less-likely-call-po/	In her first official speech on the U.S. Senate floor, Sen. Kamala Harris said President Trump’s executive actions "have hit our immigrant and religious communities like a cold front, striking a chilling fear in the hearts of millions of good hardworking people." The California Democrat went on to say that rather than making communities safe, Trump’s immigration raids and policies will make immigrants less likely to report crimes for fear they’ll be deported. "For this reason," Harris said in her Feb. 16, 2017 speech, "studies have shown Latinos are more than 40 percent less likely to call 911 when they have been a victim of a crime." Harris makes her claim at about the 7:40 minute mark in the video above. With so much focus in California on Trump’s immigration orders, we decided to fact-check Harris’s claim. Our research As evidence, a spokesman for Harris pointed to a 2013 study by a professor at the University of Chicago, Illinois, called "Insecure Communities: Latino Perceptions of Police Involvement in Immigration Enforcement." The study relied on a survey of 2,000 Hispanics, both documented and undocumented, in late 2012 in Phoenix, Los Angeles, Chicago and Houston. One of the survey questions asked respondents to agree or disagree with the following statement: "I am less likely to contact police officers if I have been the victim of a crime for fear that they will ask me or people I know about our immigration status." Overall, 44 percent of respondents agreed with the statement. That’s just about what Harris said in her claim. "Basically on target," Nik Theodore, who authored the study and is a professor at the University of Chicago’s Department of Urban Planning and Policy, told PolitiFact California. Here’s a breakdown of the share less likely to contact police by county and state surveyed: Chicago (Cook County) Illinois: 39 percent Houston (Harris County) Texas: 47 percent Los Angeles (Los Angeles County) California: 40 percent Phoenix (Maricopa County) Arizona: 50 percent Digging deeper, the study found overall 70 percent of undocumented Latinos and 28 percent of U.S.-born Latinos were hesitant to contact the police when they had been the victim of a crime. It also found that more than 40 percent of respondents were less likely to contact police about a crime they knew had taken place. The study did not report on the share of overall Americans hesitant to call police because it only surveyed Latino residents. While technically Harris says "studies" in her claim, indicating there are multiple reports that back this up, her spokesman said he could only find the single report from 2013 as evidence. 2009 Pew study Theodore told us there hasn’t been much research on Latino attitudes about police. We did find a 2009 study by the Pew Research Center that’s somewhat similar. It found 78 percent of Hispanics surveyed in 2008 said they would definitely contact police if they were the victim of a violent crime. An even higher percentage, 84 percent, said they would contact police if they were the victim of a property crime. That would indicate that, at least at that time, a smaller share than 40 percent of Latinos were hesitant to contact police when they were victims of a crime. Asked about this, Theodore said the two studies ask different questions and were completed four years apart. He added that his study "was done after an increase in police involvement in immigration enforcement." Immigrant rights groups often cite Arizona’s passage of a broad new immigration enforcement measure, SB 1070 in 2010, as eroding trust between Hispanics and law enforcement in that state. The law, which faced numerous legal challenges, required Arizona state law enforcement officers to attempt to determine a person’s immigration status when there was reasonable suspicion that person was an illegal immigrant. When looking at the two studies, only the 2013 University of Chicago study asks whether respondents would be "less likely" to contact the police if they had been the victim of a crime "for fear that they will ask me or people I know about our immigration status." The Pew study does not include the second part of that question. The Pew study did find that about 50 percent of respondents felt "just some or very little confidence that police will treat Hispanics fairly." John Thiella is a consultant with the Sacramento-based Latino Policy Coalition, which advocates for immigrant rights. He said Harris used "a fair statistic" in describing the percentage of Latinos hesitant to call police when they are victims of a crime. Thiella said there’s long been "a climate of fear and uncertainty" between Latinos and the police due to the lack of a clear path forward for undocumented residents. He said Trump’s hard-line immigration policies have deepened that fear. Obama Administration also contributed to the uncertainty by deporting more than 2.5 million illegal immigrants, more than under any president in U.S. history. Our ruling U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris said in a recent speech that "studies have shown Latinos are more than 40 percent less likely to call 911 when they have been a victim of a crime." A 2013 study by a professor at the University of Chicago, Illinois, found 44 percent of respondents (all Hispanics) agreed with the following statement: "I am less likely to contact police officers if I have been the victim of a crime for fear that they will ask me or people I know about our immigration status." The study’s author called Harris’ claim "basically on target." Harris leaves the impression there are multiple reports to back up her claim when she uses the phrase "studies have shown" in her claim. Based on our research, and comments from her spokesman, there’s only a single report that backs this up. In 2009, the Pew Research Center produced a report that indicates a smaller share of Hispanics would be hesitant to contact police if they were victims of a crime. Unlike the 2013 report, the Pew study did not raise the issue of whether respondents would be concerned police would ask about their immigration status. It also took place before an increase in police involvement in immigration enforcement around the country. In the end, Harris’ statement needs a couple clarifications but is backed up by the 2013 report. We rate it Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ebea8081-40ba-4fbd-85a4-f10c04656599	None	Kamala Harris	None	None	None	2017-02-24T06:00:00	2017-02-16	['None']
pomt-08630	Rhode Island gives undocumented pregnant women health insurance, plus a cash card "with $400 a month on it" and "$250 a month or $275 a month to spend on food."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2010/sep/19/peter-palumbo/palumbo-says-ri-gives-undocumented-pregnant-women-/	On the hot-button issue of immigration, there are few figures as outspoken about Rhode Island's policies as state Rep. Peter Palumbo, a Democrat from Cranston. Two years ago, Palumbo released a set of figures he compiled estimating what undocumented immigrants cost the state each year, how many murders they commit and the strain they put on our health care system. The report was never substantiated, but Palumbo continues to cite these and other similar figures. Palumbo and Republican state Rep. Joseph Trillo, of Warwick -- who also supports stricter enforcement of immigration laws -- went to Arizona earlier this month to see for themselves the problems that the state is having with illegal immigration. While there, they appeared together on Fox News' "On the Record With Greta Van Susteren" to discuss Rhode Island immigration policy. Criticizing the state's social service programs, Palumbo said: "We have something called the anchor embryos. We have such liberal programs where we take care of you. If you're an illegal woman you get to Rhode Island, you go to the Department of Human Services, they give you either Neighborhood Health [Plan], United[Health] or Blue Cross. They give you a card with $400 a month on it and allow you to spend it on anything but food because, sit tight, we're going to give you another $250 a month or $275 a month to spend on food." We asked Palumbo about his source for such exact dollar figures. He said he got each piece of information from Gary Alexander, the head of Rhode Island's Office of Health and Human Services, in a lengthy conversation they had about two years ago when Palumbo first became interested in the issue. Alexander told us he recalls briefly discussing the topic of benefits for undocumented pregnant women with Palumbo at some point, but he said he never cited any of the specific figures that Palumbo lists, nor would he, because they're just not accurate. "I don't even know how he would get totals like $400 or $250," Alexander said. Health care policy for undocumented pregnant women So what do state and federal policies say about benefits for pregnant women who are in Rhode Island illegally? First, they are eligible for health insurance under RIte Care, the state's health insurance program for low-income families, according to state officials. And federal law dictates that they must be given a choice between providers, Alexander said. Until just a few weeks ago, those choices included Neighborhood Health Plan, UnitedHealthCare, or Blue Cross & Blue Shield. In August, Blue Cross announced it would no longer participate in the program. Women who are pregnant are not required to declare their immigration status when enrolling in RIte Care, assuming they meet the income eligibility requirements. The way Alexander and federal officials explain it, the rationale is this: because the child will be born in the United States, he or she will be an American citizen and therefore eligible for health benefits. Prenatal care is considered an extension of those benefits. "It's not based on the mother, it's based on the child who will soon be a citizen. If we don't give [the mother] prenatal care, something could happen to the child," leading to even greater costs for the state, said Alexander, who was appointed by Governor Donald Carcieri, a Republican. Even if the DHS did not offer health benefits, state law would still require hospitals to provide emergency care to anyone, Alexander added. The mother's health benefits end three months after delivery. Palumbo is therefore correct on what he says about free health care. Cash assistance policy Next Palumbo says undocumented pregnant women get "a card with $400 a month on it" that they are "allow[ed] to spend [on] anything but food." Sounds a bit like a state gift certificate to us, but Palumbo says he was referring to cash assistance welfare benefits. Again, he said Alexander told him that every undocumented pregnant woman who seeks state help gets $400 a month. Not so, said the DHS secretary, who said he couldn't imagine where Palumbo could have gotten such specific figures. Pregnant women who are in Rhode Island illegally are not eligible for welfare benefits and even if they were, how much they get would depend on their income, said OHHS Associate Director David Burnett. Under the Bush-administration's Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, anyone seeking cash benefits or other federal assistance must provide identifying documentation proving their legal status, according to the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. It's important to note that, as with healthcare benefits, once the child is born, as a citizen, he or she will be eligible for welfare benefits, which would presumably be delivered to the mother on behalf of the child. But the mother herself does not qualify for any subsidy. So Palumbo is incorrect to say pregnant women get welfare benefits. Food stamps policy The same is true for the federal Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, more commonly known as the food stamp program. Despite the figures Palumbo cites, undocumented pregnant women are not eligible for "$250 a month or $275 a month," or any other amount. Under the federal Deficit Reduction Act, without proof of citizenship, they can't receive the benefit. Once born, their children will qualify to enroll in the SNAP program. According to the University of Rhode Island's Feinstein Center for a Hunger Free America, the maximum is $200 a month per qualifying member. But the subsidy will not cover the mother. Again, Palumbo is wrong. Finally, there is a clear implication in Palumbo's statement that Rhode Island's benefits are more generous than those in other states. At one point in the Van Susteren interview, Palumbo suggested that undocumented pregnant women from elsewhere are "headed to our state" to take advantage of these programs. Federal law now dictates that undocumented people -- pregnant or otherwise -- are not eligible for either welfare assistance or food stamps here, or anywhere. By the same token, undocumented pregnant women in Rhode Island are eligible to receive health care benefits, but that is also true in some other states. While federal law won't cover undocumented people, in general, it gives states the option to use federal CHIP (Children's Health Insurance Program) to cover prenatal benefits. To imply that Rhode Island is the only state where this is the case is not correct. In all, two of the three facts Palumbo offered to Van Susteren were wrong. Worse, he cited as his source an official -- Gary Alexander -- who said he never said any of those specifics, in part because they are not true. Palumbo used very exact numbers on national television and he stated them with the kind of confidence that could lead viewers to believe he had done his homework and knew what he was talking about. He didn't and he doesn't, at least in two of three counts. We'll give him a Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Peter Palumbo	None	None	None	2010-09-19T00:01:00	2010-09-09	['Rhode_Island']
pomt-04074	Says his elections proposal would allow "a potential of 168 hours (of early voting), which I think is the most we’ve ever had."	true	/florida/statements/2013/jan/22/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-his-plan-would-expand-early-voting/	Gov. Rick Scott wants Florida lawmakers to revisit the 2011 elections overhaul, which was widely blamed for problems with early voting during last year’s presidential election. In an interview on Miami-based WPLG Channel 10, Scott stressed he wants local supervisors to have the option to implement the most early voting hours in Florida history. "What I think we ought to be doing is give the flexibility to our supervisors of elections, most of them, as you know, are elected county by county, but say you can do anywhere from eight to 14 days, six to 12 hours a day," Scott said in the Jan. 18, 2013, interview, "so a potential of 168 hours, which I think is the most we’ve ever had." Scott, who refused to extend early voting in 2012 despite long lines at some polls, is also calling on the Legislature to restore early voting on the Sunday before Election Day -- the day when African-American groups hosted popular "Souls to the Polls" events. Here we’ll examine whether Scott is right to say his proposal would be the most hours for early voting. Florida’s history with early voting is short. Former Gov. Jeb Bush signed early voting into law in 2004. That law required early voting to start 15 days before an election, with at least eight hours per weekday and eight hours total for each weekend. Voters had 104 early voting hours. Even though election supervisors asked for more hours and more locations, Bush and the GOP-led Legislature passed a new law in 2005 that reduced hours and confined voting to election offices, city halls and libraries. Under the new law, early voting lasted 14 days, for eight hours on weekdays and a total of eight hours on the weekend. That’s 96 hours. In the 2008 presidential election, voters had more time to vote early thanks to an emergency extension ordered by Gov. Charlie Crist (read that executive order.) Many news accounts put the total number of early voting hours in 2008 at 120, but the Department of State calculates it at 116. In 2011, the Legislature passed a sweeping elections law that reduced the amount of days for early voting from 14 to eight. The new law gave supervisors a choice of offering between between six and 12 hours of early voting each day. (Here’s a related check on that.) So local elections supervisors had the choice to offer between 48 hours and 96 hours of early voting over eight days. The Legislature is poised to tweak the state’s early voting system again in 2013 because of the long waits to vote in some places during the 2012 presidential election. Scott, echoing proposals from the elections supervisors association, recommended the Legislature give supervisors the ability to offer between eight and 14 days of early voting, while maintaining six to 12 hours each day. He also wants to add more early voting sites. So under Scott’s proposal, supervisors would be able to provide a maximum of 168 hours of early voting (14 days multiplied by 12 hours a day). On the flip side, the fewest number of hours they would be required to offer is 48 (eight days multiplied by six hours). Activists behind the liberal campaign Pink Slip Rick disapproved of Scott’s proposal, saying Scott should have restored the number of days for early voting to 14, the way it was before the 2011 election law. "Anything less than that is not a promise to restore or expand early voting," said Amy Ritter, executive director of Florida Watch Action, the liberal group behind Pink Slip Rick. A few election supervisors we interviewed about Scott’s plan said they welcomed the idea of tailoring early voting to their home county’s needs. "We kind of came to the conclusion that obviously, with Florida being such a huge and diverse state, one size does not fit all," said Brian Corley, Pasco County supervisor of elections. Corley, who heads up legislative affairs for the state supervisors association, said he does not think Pasco would need the full 168 hours, but "it’s nice to have the option, if need be, for a major presidential election." A spokeswoman for Broward County supervisor of elections Brenda Snipes said her office had not yet begun planning for the scenario under Scott’s plan but would probably go back to 14 days of early voting, the way things were before the Legislature’s 2011 law. "We would likely conduct early voting as it was structured prior to HB 1355," said public services director Mary Cooney in an email. Our ruling Scott said that his proposal would allow "a potential of 168 hours, which I think is the most we’ve ever had" for early voting. He’s right that his proposal would give supervisors of elections the option to offer 168 hours of early voting, and that would be a record. We should note that supervisors would also have the option to only offer 48 hours of voting, which is less than previous law. But Scott was very careful with his wording, noting that 168 hours was the maximum and outlining the specific days and hours. A claim from his critics, Pink Slip Rick, said the law "only mandates 48 hours of early voting." We rated that Mostly True, because it didn't leave open the possibility of more hours. Scott's statement, on the other hand, specifically notes that the 168 hours are a maximum. Scott chose his words carefully and precisely. We rate his statement True.

pomt-07210	Says this month’s special session will cost the state $27,300 a day just for legislators’ daily living expenses.	true	/texas/statements/2011/jun/06/jason-isaac/state-rep-jason-isaac-says-diem-costs-taxpayers-27/	After a Democrat’s filibuster derailed legislation considered essential by the Republican-steered Legislature, state Rep. Jason Isaac said the gambit had a cost. "Back to work tomorrow. Per diem alone costs taxpayers $27,300/day," the Dripping Springs Republican tweeted May 30. Nearly $30,000 a day? As legislators started the 30-day special session immediately called by Gov. Rick Perry, Ellen Troxclair, Isaac’s chief of staff, told us Isaac based his figure on information from the Texas Ethics Commission. Some background: A provision in the Texas Constitution provides for each legislator and the lieutenant governor, who presides over the Senate, to receive a $600 monthly salary, mileage reimbursements and the per diem, which is a stipend intended to ease lawmaker living expenses while they’re in Austin on state business each day during regular and special sessions. The commission, established in 1991, sets the per diem and also may recommend raises for legislators to voters, though that’s not happened. According to information on the commission’s website, the current legislative per diem is $150. So, counting the 150 Texas House members, 31 senators and Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, 182 lawmakers qualify for the payment each day lawmakers are in session. Total potential daily cost: $27,300. According to the Texas State Historical Association, the Constitution of 1876 set a legislator’s compensation at $5 per day for the first 60 days of a regular session and $2 for each day after. A 1930 constitutional amendment changed the per diem to $10 for the first 120 days of the session and $5 after. During special sessions, the per diem was $10. A 1954 amendment raised the per diem to no more than $25 for the first 120 days of the regular session, while a 1960 amendment greenlighted paying legislators an annual salary of up to $4,800 plus a $12 per diem during the first 120 days of each regular session and each day of the special session. Per diem amounts inched up in later years with the commission setting the rate at $168 in January 2009, according to a Nov. 12 2010, news story in the Austin American-Statesman. But after the commission proposed authorizing the same rate members of the 2011 Legislature, Dewhurst and House Speaker Joe Straus called for the rate to be lowered to $150 in a Nov. 29, 2010 letter stating the move would help the state tighten overall spending. Do lawmakers ever pass up the per diem? Patsy Spaw, the Senate secretary, told us that no senators have declined the payments since 2003 when Senate Democrats fled to New Mexico to impede the passage of redistricting legislation. Steven Adrian, executive director of the House Business Office, told us no representatives have submitted a request to withhold or reduce per diem payments this session. Isaac’s statement adds up to True.	None	Jason Isaac	None	None	None	2011-06-06T06:00:00	2011-05-30	['None']
pomt-02341	On HealthCare.Gov, Texan Mark Sullivan "found a good" health insurance "plan that includes dental, for less than $80 a month."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2014/mar/24/kathleen-sebelius/kathleen-sebelius-obamacare-understates-costs/	Urging Texans without health insurance to hop to shopping before a looming enrollment deadline, Kathleen Sebelius enthused about a Texan she described as landing a good deal via the HealthCare.gov website. Sebelius, the U.S. secretary of Health and Human Services, said in an opinion column published in the March 18, 2014, Austin American-Statesman: "On a recent visit to the Lone Star State, I met Mark Sullivan, a 31-year-old software developer. Though he was eager to start his own business, the thought of fending for himself without his employer-based health coverage made him hesitate. "But then Mark researched his options on HealthCare.gov. You can imagine his excitement when he found a good plan that includes dental, for less than $80 a month." That column touting Sullivan’s experience also appeared in the Dallas Morning News, San Antonio Express-News, El Paso Times and McAllen Monitor. We were curious about Sullivan’s experience on the Obamacare website, which often didn’t function at its launch. Did Sullivan, co-founder of an Austin-based company, snag an early health/dental bargain anyway? An account re-told Sullivan’s sign-up success has been a centerpiece for advocates at least since an Oct. 4, 2013, web post by Enroll America, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit focused on maximizing the number of Americans enrolled in and retaining health coverage. Enroll America’s post said Sullivan overcame glitches on HealthCare.gov shortly after the site’s debut to line up affordable coverage for himself, effective in 2014. After comparing plans, Enroll America said, Sullivan "settled on a bronze option and added dental insurance. He will receive an $82 per month subsidy, which will halve the monthly premium he will pay down to $78." Sebelius’ oped column, distributed about five months later, made no mention of Sullivan’s subsidy. Enroll America’s write-up further noted that Sullivan’s subsidy might decrease: "While his new startup will require a lot of personal expense early on, if profits grow faster than he projects, his subsidy may end up being a bit lower by the end of the year. That’s no concern for Mark, since even without the tax credit, his total premium is still much more affordable than the private plans he had been able to find on the individual market." On Oct. 25, 2013, Sullivan joined an Austin press conference where Sebelius talked up the importance of residents complying with the mandate that Americans obtain coverage, as noted in news stories by outlets including the American-Statesman. (The next enrollment deadline is March 31, 2014.) Agency spokesman: Dental plan an added cost We asked a Washington, D.C.-based HHS spokesman, Fabien Levy, for backup related to Sebelius’ description of Sullivan’s shopping success. Levy largely deferred to Sullivan, though by email Levy said the described dental coverage has been costing Sullivan $15 a month in addition to the less than $80 for health and dental coverage celebrated by Sebelius. Hence, Levy said, the original column was being revised. A fresh version sent by the agency to the Statesman lacked any mention of Sullivan’s dental plan. Sullivan offers details Fortuitously, Sullivan elaborated on his experience on HealthCare.gov. By phone, Sullivan told us he pays $77.67 a month to Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas to be in its Blue Advantage Bronze HMO plan. On a Blue Cross and Blue Shield web page, the plan is described as having an individual annual deductible of $6,000 along with maximum annual out-of-pocket costs to the purchaser. Notably, though, the purchaser must pay all medical costs up to that ceiling. Also, according to information on the web page, the plan covers 100 percent of prescription costs once the deductible is paid. By phone, Sullivan told us that in addition to the costs of his health policy, he chose to pay about $15 a month for a Starmount Life Insurance Co. dental plan. By email, Sullivan shared a computer screen shot of a Blue Cross Blue Shield web page showing that his health coverage, effective Jan. 1, 2014, would cost $159.67 without his $82 monthly subsidy; which was awarded based on his income, Sullivan said. The image shows that thanks to the subsidy, he’s been paying $77.67 a month. Sullivan said he appreciated the plan’s low monthly cost to him, its provision for a free annual check-up and its cap on out-of-pocket expenses. Notably, too, he said a medication he purchased in February that would have cost him more than $340 if he had no coverage ended up costing only $30 out of pocket. Looking back, Sullivan wrote that he had trouble logging on to HealthCare.gov the first three days of October, but by Oct. 4, he was browsing 76 available plans and, to his memory, signed up for his plan a day later. "Overall, the shopping experience was a good one," Sullivan wrote. In his view, he wrote,"the only thing slightly off" in Sebelius’ published statement "is that the dental coverage was separate from health insurance, which was an additional $15/month that I probably wouldn't have chosen without the subsidy." Our ruling On HealthCare.Gov, Sebelius wrote, Texan Mark Sullivan "found a good" health insurance "plan that includes dental, for less than $80 a month." No doubt, Sullivan liked how things worked out for him. But Sebelius’ recap struck us as incomplete and misleading. The secretary incorrectly described what Sullivan pays as covering both medical and dental coverage; the latter costs him about $15 more a month. The article also didn’t acknowledge that Sullivan’s monthly charge was fueled by an $82-a-month subsidy. Also, there was no concession that purchasers including Sullivan must pay $6,000 a year for medical procedures before the plan pitches in on such. We rate this statement as Mostly False.

pomt-05416	"Wisconsin lost more jobs over the past 12 months than any other state."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/may/02/barbara-buono/chris-christie-campaign-scott-walker-new-jersey-st/	With Gov. Chris Christie heading west to campaign for Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, state Sen. Barbara Buono took a moment this week to inform New Jerseyans that the Badger State is leading the nation -- in job losses. A little more than a year after signing a bill restricting collective bargaining rights for most public employees -- legislation that set off massive protests and attracted national media attention -- Walker is facing a recall election on June 5. The primary for the recall election is next Tuesday. As Christie prepared to visit Wisconsin the next day, Buono, a Democrat representing part of Middlesex County, issued a news release on Monday criticizing the two Republican governors. "Our governor seems more concerned with one man’s job in Wisconsin than the legions of unemployed constituents at home," Buono said in the news release. "It’s not as if Scott Walker has any advice to offer. Wisconsin lost more jobs over the past 12 months than any other state." PolitiFact New Jersey discovered that Buono’s statistic is on target. From March 2011 to March 2012, Wisconsin lost more jobs than any other state, according to seasonally adjusted data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Here’s how the labor figures break down. We normally analyze job growth in both "net" terms -- the actual number of jobs lost or gained -- and "percentage" terms. By both measures, Wisconsin finished in last place for over-the-year employment changes -- driven in large part by the loss of government jobs. In March 2012, Wisconsin had 2,730,600 jobs, representing a loss of 23,900 jobs, or 0.9 percent, since March 2011. The state’s net loss of jobs far surpassed the next highest amount of 3,500 jobs lost in Mississippi. The March 2012 figures are preliminary and subject to change. Nearly 75 percent of the jobs lost in Wisconsin during the past year occurred in the public sector, which accounted for 17,800 of the job losses. Steven Deller, a professor of Agricultural and Applied Economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, argued that the political dynamics in the state has negatively impacted the business climate. "In addition to the massive budget cuts at the state and local level the political dynamics has cast a black cloud over the business climate of the state," Deller told us in an e-mail. "People/businesses are starting to say ‘stop the political war and work together’. This is independent of party affiliation." In case you’re wondering how job growth in New Jersey compares with the rest of the nation, here are the Garden State’s statistics: From March 2011 to March 2012, New Jersey gained 38,300 jobs for an increase of 1 percent. That growth represents increases of 35,200 private-sector jobs and 3,100 public-sector jobs. For total employment changes among all 50 states, New Jersey ranked 15th in net terms and 24th in percentage terms. Our ruling In a news release issued Monday, Buono offered this statistic about the Badger State: "Wisconsin lost more jobs over the past 12 months than any other state." According to federal labor statistics, Buono’s claim is accurate. From March 2011 to March 2012, Wisconsin lost 23,900 jobs, or 0.9 percent, placing the state in last place for both measures.

pomt-02782	"At present spending levels, only citizens of New York have a greater local debt burden than Texans."	true	/texas/statements/2013/dec/06/debra-medina/texas-near-top-local-debt-capita/	In a Nov. 13, 2013, campaign press release, Debra Medina pledged that as Texas state comptroller she would "resist growth in government spending," saying, "At present spending levels, only citizens of New York have a greater local debt burden than Texans." An earlier version of the claim sent out via email said simply "greater debt burden," not "local"; the campaign posted an updated release online. We looked at state debt in a July 24, 2011, fact-check on Gov. Rick Perry, rating as Mostly True his claim that Texas had "the fourth-lowest debt per capita of any state in the nation, and we are the lowest of any of the big states." How does debt shake out at the local level? Medina, a tea-party favorite from Wharton, got 19 percent of the vote in the 2010 Republican gubernatorial primary against Gov. Rick Perry and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison. The Medina campaign told us via email that her Texas-New York comparison was based on a Sept. 26, 2012, report, "Your Money and Local Debt," issued by the current state comptroller, Susan Combs. In 2009, Texas had $7,983 in local debt per capita, the report said, placing Texas second among the 10 most populous states. New York was first with $8,744 in local debt per capita; California was third with $6,469 per capita. Texas comptroller report, "Your Money and Local Debt," Sept. 26, 2012, based on 2009 data: The report relied on 2009 U.S. Census Bureau data, which Combs spokesman R.J. DeSilva told us via email was drawn from the December 2011 annual report of the Texas Bond Review Board. That agency oversees the issuance of state bonds used to fund activities as varied as making housing loans to veterans and helping local governments finance water projects. "State and local debt" are defined in the bureau’s July 2013 summary of 2011 data as "all interest-bearing short-term credit obligations and all long-term obligations incurred in the name of the government and all its dependent agencies, whether used for public or private purposes." U.S. states divide local and state responsibilities in different ways. Texas spends little at the state level; local costs may be borne by hospital districts, school districts and the like in addition to city and county governments. The Census and Board both presented local debt estimates alongside state debt. We next looked for comparisons using more recent data and all 50 states. The Bond Review Board offers its own annual estimate of local debt in Texas. In the most recent report that was available when Medina’s release was sent out, published in December 2012, the agency said Texas’ local debt per capita was $7,507 in the fiscal year that ran through August 2011. Board spokesman Robert Latsha told us by phone that, though he wasn’t certain exactly what the Census included in its figures, it’s likely the largest difference between the Census and board estimates comes from debt set up by quasi-governmental agencies such as local housing finance corporations or economic development corporations. Only debt from bonds and shorter-term securities issued by local governments is reported to the board, Latsha said. He said the board didn’t calculate comparisons with all 50 states. Census Bureau spokesman Joseph Dalaker told us by phone that the bureau didn’t either, but he helped us find data comparable to what the board probably used when comparing the 10 biggest states. Using those Census estimates of local debt and state population -- from the most recent data sets available when Medina spoke in November 2013 -- we found Texas was third among all 50 states and, again, second among the 10 most populous. Highest local debt per capita among all 50 states: New York $10,204 Nevada $8,520 Texas $8,431 California $7,075 Kansas $7,011 Colorado $6,911 Washington $6,660 Minnesota $6,295 Illinois $6,267 Kentucky $6,259 Sources: U.S. Census Bureau population estimates, July 12, 2012, and local debt estimates, Dec. 6, 2012 In the board’s December 2013 report, which came out after Medina made her statement, the state board updated local debt per capita in fiscal 2012 to $7,514 by its own estimation and $8,431 according to Census data, keeping Texas in second place among the 10 most populous states. Medina’s claim referred to the debt burden falling on "citizens." But state residents might not be directly on the hook for the whole amount. Dalaker told us, "You really have to tease out who’s paying." For example, taxes on tourists can help pay for projects, he said. Moody’s Investors Service spokesman David Jacobson told us by phone, "What’s more important is your ability to pay back that debt and how it is structured." Many Texas entities have good credit, he said. Our ruling Medina said, "At present spending levels, only citizens of New York have a greater local debt burden than Texans," but without mentioning that her comparison was based on the 10 most-populated states. Texas is second among the big states and third among all 50 in recent estimates. We rate her statement as True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

pomt-14591	Says Bernie Sanders advocated putting "Iranian troops into Syria to try and resolve the conflict there. Putting them right on the doorstep of Israel."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/05/hillary-clinton/clinton-says-sanders-proposed-iranian-troops-syria/	In a heated debate ahead of the New Hampshire primary, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders sharpened the contrasts between them. Appearing on a stage at the University of New Hampshire in Durham, Clinton targeted Sanders’ relative lack of national security experience. "A group of national security experts issued a very concerning statement about Sen. Sanders views on foreign policy and national security, pointing out some of the comments he has made on these issues," Clinton said. "Such as inviting Iranian troops into Syria to try and resolve the conflict there. Putting them right on the doorstep of Israel." Last month, the Clinton campaign posted a critique of Sanders on precisely this point. The campaign said Sanders "has put forth proposals that indicate a lack of engagement and fundamental misunderstandings about the challenges before us." It cited Sanders’ own words. We found them on his Senate website and in the transcript of a November 2015 Democratic debate. In September 2014, Sanders issued a news release. It rejected any thought of sending American ground troops into Syria to fight ISIS. That level of fighting in Syria, he said, should be left to the Muslim nations. "The war against ISIS, a brutal and dangerous organization, cannot be won unless the Muslim nations which are most threatened -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Turkey, Iran and Jordan -- become fully engaged, including the use of ground troops," Sanders said. "The U.S. and the international community should be fully supportive, but the leadership in this war must come from the Muslim world." During the Democratic debate in Des Moines, Iowa, Nov. 11, 2015, Sanders echoed that point. "Here's something that I believe we have to do as we put together an international coalition, and that is we have to understand that the Muslim nations in the region -- Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Jordan -- all of these nations, they're going to have to get their hands dirty, their boots on the ground. They are going to have to take on ISIS." Warren Gunnels, policy adviser for the Sanders campaign, told us Sanders was promoting the idea of a broad Muslim coalition. "He has never advocated specifically for Iranian troops in Syria, but that there must be a coalition of nations with U.S. troops providing support," Gunnels said. "He certainly never advocated for Iranian troops on the Israeli border." It’s true that Sanders envisioned that the Iranian troops would be part of a much larger Muslim coalition that included Jordan and Turkey. While both nations might have significant disagreements with Israel, neither is an enemy of the Jewish state. Still, we can take it that Sanders did promote the presence of Iranian troops in Syria. Whether those troops themselves would be on the border with Israel is unknowable, but Syria of course shares a border with Israel. And Iran is no friend of Israel. Our ruling Clinton said Sanders suggested that Iranian troops should fight on the ground in Syria. Sanders did advance that idea on two occasions. But Sanders’ comments were in the context of a multi-national Muslim fighting force that included nations largely friendly toward Israel. The statement is accurate but lacks some useful details. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-02-05T00:02:37	2016-02-04	['Syria', 'Iran', 'Israel', 'Bernie_Sanders']
pomt-10576	"In her short time in the United States Senate, the senator from New York, Senator Clinton, got $500-million worth of pork barrel projects."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/04/john-mccain/clinton-brought-home-even-more-bacon-/	With polls showing he has a solid lead in most Super Tuesday states, Sen. John McCain took aim at Sen. Hillary Clinton while campaigning in Fairfield, Conn., on Feb. 3, 2008. McCain boasted that he never sought special projects for his state, while Clinton had sought too many. "In her short time in the United States Senate, the senator from New York, Senator Clinton, got $500-million worth of pork barrel projects. My friends, that kind of thing is going to stop," McCain said. We have previously found exceptions in McCain's claims about his own pork (we gave him a False in this item), but he's right that Clinton brought lots of federal money to New York. It's just that he dramatically understates how much pork she got. After she was elected in 2000, Clinton spent her first term focusing heavily on parochial issues. Often joining forces with the senior senator from New York, fellow Democrat Charles Schumer, Clinton issued a blizzard of news releases touting federal money such as $250,000 for "artspace" projects in Buffalo, $200,000 for the Mid-Hudson Children's Museum, $200,00 for the YWCA of Niagara and $69,036 for the golden nematode project at Cornell University (yeah, we had to look it up: the golden nematode is a pest that harms potatoes). The McCain campaign says it got the $500-million figure from two news stories — a Los Angeles Times, report from December 2007 that said "since taking office in 2001, Clinton has delivered $500-million worth of earmarks that have specifically benefited 59 corporations," and a report in The Hill , a Washington, D.C., political newspaper that said Clinton obtained at least $530-million in federal money from the first three of the 13 appropriations bills approved in 2007. But those reflect just a portion of Clinton's prolific pork production. Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group that tracks congressional spending, has identified about $2.2-billion in Clinton projects in her seven years in the Senate. The group won't publish its final database for several weeks, but Keith Ashdown, an investigator for the group, said a preliminary analysis showed Clinton has brought home far more in federal money than the other senators in the presidential race, McCain and Barack Obama. Ashdown likened Clinton to Al D'Amato, the famous pothole politician who represented New York from 1981 to 1999. "She has used the power of the purse to take care of a lot of areas of New York," Ashdown said. So McCain is right that Clinton has brought truckloads of bacon to her New York constituents. McCain just dramatically understates the amount. (McCain's campaign said he was simply being "conservative" with his claim.) For our ruling, we find that while McCain's numbers are low, he's actually more correct than he realizes because she's brought so much pork to New York. We rate his attack Mostly True.

pomt-13429	"In the mid 1990s, in our state, (Florida was) No. 1 in violent crime in America. ... The only concern I had was for the citizens of Florida, who were subjected to a violent crime every three minutes and 45 seconds."	true	/florida/statements/2016/sep/19/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-says-florida-was-no-1-violent-crime/	Former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist’s past positions as a Republican lawmaker are being brought back to light as Crist seeks to return to elected office as a Democrat. Crist is challenging incumbent Rep. David Jolly, R-Belleair Bluffs, for Florida’s 13th Congressional District, which includes Pinellas County at the western edge of Florida’s pivotal I-4 corridor. At a televised debate in St. Petersburg Sept. 19, 2016, moderators from the Tampa Bay Times and 10 News WTSP allowed the candidates to ask the other a question. Crist declined, saying he’d rather save the time for a question from a college student. Jolly used the time to bring up Crist’s proposal to restore chain gangs to Florida while Crist served as a Republican in the state Senate in the 1990s. Jolly painted a vivid picture of Crist traveling to Alabama in 1995 with Florida’s first African-American corrections secretary to inspect a chain gang in operation. "You stood there, over three African-American prisoners in, chains, on their knees on the side of the road. Saying that it was a great sight," Jolly said to Crist. Jolly closed by asking, "Did you ever hesitate, or did you just see political opportunity in that moment to be a Republican tough on crime?" Crist said "it was beneath" Jolly to suggest it had something to do with race, and the state needed to be tough given how bad violent crime was in Florida at the time. "In the mid 1990s, in our state, we were No. 1 in violent crime in America," Crist said. "The only concern I had was for the citizens of Florida, who were subjected to a violent crime every three minutes and 45 seconds," Crist added. In a separate fact-check, we examined Jolly’s story about Crist’s visit to Alabama. Here, we are looking at Crist’s rebuttal. When it comes to the facts, Crist is correct on both statistics. Crist’s campaign directed us to data from the Disaster Center, which used FBI Uniform Crime Reports to compare violent crime across states. The data shows from 1991 to 1997, Florida was ranked No. 1 for the rate of violent crimes for every 100,000 people. To calculate the rate of violent crime, you take the total number for each of the violent crime categories (murder, rape, robbery and assault) for every 100,000 population in that year. In 1998, Florida was ranked No. 2., with New Mexico earning the top spot. The number of violent crimes decreased in Florida throughout the 1990s, mirroring a national trend. As for Crist’s other statistic, it was actually happening more often than he said for most of the decade. The year 1993 marked Crist’s first year in the Florida Senate and a record-high amount of violent crimes (161,789). According to Florida Department of Law Enforcement data, a violent crime happened every three minutes and 14 seconds. The figure stretched to three minutes and 19 seconds in 1994, and then to three minutes and 28 seconds in 1995. In 1998, violent crimes were occurring every three minutes and 45 seconds — what Crist said. In 2015, violent crimes happened every five minutes and 37 seconds. Our ruling Crist said, "in the mid 1990s, in our state, we were No. 1 in violent crime in America. ... The only concern I had was for the citizens of Florida, who were subjected to a violent crime every three minutes and 45 seconds." Crist is correct on both factual claims. Florida led the nation in the rate of violent crimes per 100,000 population in the mid 1990s. And Florida did see a violent crime committed every three minutes and 45 seconds. In fact, for many years in the 1990s, a violent crime was committed even more often. We rate Crist’s statement True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/95fa7bae-0471-4b13-aa94-917cbebbda9f	None	Charlie Crist	None	None	None	2016-09-19T20:55:18	2016-09-19	['United_States', 'Florida']
pomt-15357	"President Obama in November of last year wiped away (a program) that allows for shared fingerprinting for those who are behind bars so you know who is here legally and illegally."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2015/jul/08/harris-faulkner/fox-news-host-obama-ended-program-tracking-undocum/	When an undocumented immigrant from Mexico allegedly shot and killed a 32-year-old woman in San Francisco July 1, 2015, he triggered a round of finger pointing that variously laid blame on the San Francisco Sheriff’s Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the White House. On Fox News, host Harris Faulkner connected the tragedy with a shift in administration policy last November. The Department of Homeland Security ended a program called Secure Communities that used fingerprints sent by local police departments to flag people who were in the country illegally. "President Obama in November of last year wiped away the Secure Communities program," Faulkner said on Outnumbered on July 6, 2015. "When you take away a program that allows for shared fingerprinting for those who are behind bars so you know who is here legally and illegally ... you're tacitly saying we don't really care who we have in this country." Obama did end the Secure Communities program, but state and local law enforcement agencies still send the fingerprints of people they arrest to Washington. What has changed is how federal officials use that information. Secure Communities The Secure Communities program rolled out across the country from late 2008 through 2012. Basically, it had three parts. When state and local officials arrested someone, they would send their fingerprints to the FBI, and from there, those fingerprints would go to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a division within the Department of Homeland Security. ICE would look for matches in its files of people who had broken one immigration law or another, such as attempting to sneak across the border, overstaying a visa or some other violation. If it spotted someone, ICE would issue a detaining order. Local authorities would then hold the person so federal officers could pick him or her up for deportation. Secure Communities racked up big numbers. By 2013, the program had led to the deportations of about 300,000 people. Federal immigration officials using the program had identified about 1.5 million potential violators. But policy and legal setbacks quickly emerged. Many large cities and counties in states from Maryland to California began to refuse to honor the federal detaining orders. They complained that immigrants who were victims of crime were not telling police out of fear that they or people they knew would be caught in the program’s net. In 2014, an Oregon judge ruled that local officials had violated a woman’s Fourth Amendment rights by keeping her without proper cause. In November 2014, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson released a memo that replaced Secure Communities with a more targeted effort called the Priority Enforcement Program. What remained and what changed Specialists in immigration law and a spokesman for ICE explained that Secure Communities was actually a 3-step process. 1: Local and state police share the fingerprints of people they arrest. 2: ICE identifies matches in its database. 3: ICE issues a detaining order. Everything we learned said the first two steps remain in effect. Adam Cox is a researcher and law professor at the New York University School of Law. He and Thomas Miles at the University of Chicago School of Law got into the nuts and bolts of Secure Communities in the course of assessing its impact on crime. "The core technological innovation of mandatory, nationwide fingerprint screening, is unchanged and here to stay," Cox said. A spokesman for ICE, Pedro Ribeiro, confirmed that. Ribeiro explained that fingerprint sharing is standard procedure for just about every police department and sheriff’s office in the country. Some do it faster than others and some have better technology, but it is regular practice to send fingerprints to the National Crime Information Center at the FBI. Once the data is there, it is shared automatically with Homeland Security and other agencies. There’s nothing the locals can do to stop it. In 2014, the FBI’s center averaged 12 million data transactions each day. The system is a basic tool in fighting crime and countering terrorists, and when ICE gets the data, it helps track people in the country without authorization. The American Immigration Council advocates on behalf of immigrants. Mark Noferi tracks enforcement policy for the council and said that elements of Secure Communities shifted to other parts of Homeland Security. "By February 2014, the Criminal Alien Program was already responsible for the day-to-day management of Secure Communities fingerprint-sharing," Noferi said. "So, by Nov. 20, 2014, when Secretary Johnson ended ‘Secure Communities as we know it,’ DHS had already operationally combined Secure Communities with another ICE program." The part of the program that stopped in late 2014 was the practice of issuing detaining orders solely on the basis of breaking the country’s immigration laws. Enforcement was refocused on people convicted of a serious crime, participating in gang activity, selling drugs and so on. We heard from ICE that the process of identifying people who are in the country illegally continues, with database matches flowing to regional ICE centers. What happens to them there depends on the severity of the offense. Our ruling Faulkner said that Obama ended Secure Communities, a program that used fingerprint sharing to identify people in the country illegally. She is correct that Obama ended that program, but outside experts and ICE itself told us that the process of sharing fingerprints and identifying people who are not supposed to be in America continues. What ended was the deportation process that was at the center of Secure Communities. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out a lot of important information. So we rate it Half True. Correction: Kathryn Steinle, the woman slain in San Francisco was in town to visit a sister-in-law who was expecting. The original report had that Steinle was expecting.

pomt-04629	Says "if current trends continue, by 2040, one out of three Texas workers will not have a high school diploma."	true	/texas/statements/2012/sep/14/bill-hammond/bill-hammond-says-if-trends-hold-one-three-texas-w/	In an opinion piece published in Texas newspapers in August 2012, the chairman of the Texas Association of Business opened his call for funding successful preschool programs by suggesting potential among the state’s toddlers. "Our homes and preschools are filled with aspiring astronauts, firefighters, teachers and computer scientists," Bill Hammond wrote. "Unfortunately, if current trends continue, by 2040, one out of three Texas workers will not have a high school diploma. That's not dreaming big, that's a Texas-sized nightmare. It's a formula for broken dreams, dead-end jobs and a strain on the state's economy." Are we on track for one of three adult Texans to lack even a high school diploma? That would be more than double the nearly 15 percent of the state’s 10.2 million workers aged 25 through 64 who had not graduated from high school as of 2010, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. Asked for his backup, Hammond pointed us toward Steven Murdock, the former state demographer who directs the Hobby Center for the Study of Texas at Rice University. In a telephone interview, Murdock said Hammond was echoing a projection included in a 2003 book, "The New Texas Challenge," written by several authors led by Murdock. Murdock told us the projection, to be updated within the next year, was based on changes in the state’s racial and ethnic populations and assuming that people would continue to have the same levels of education in 2040 as 2000. Broadly, he said, generally highly-educated baby boomers have started retiring from the workforce and will continue to do so for the next 15 years. He said the baby boomers are being replaced with less-educated workers. "It’s a simple simulation," he said. "What we’re simply saying is that" the share of workers lacking a high school diploma "will absolutely be the case if we have the population growth we project and we do not have a change in the educational attainment of our different racial and ethnic groups." The relevant section of the book says that "in the absence of change in the educational characteristics of Blacks and Hispanics -- populations that are projected to grow more rapidly than the Anglo population -- the state’s labor force will be less well educated in the future than in 2000." A chart in the book shows that in 2000, nearly 19 percent of the state’s labor force lacked a high school diploma while 30.1 percent of the workforce will fit that category as of 2040. The projection, Murdock writes, is predicated on assuming that migration rates by age, sex and race-ethnicity remain what they were from 1990 to 2000. According to the chart, some 29 percent of the workforce will consist of high school graduates, about the same as in 2000, and about 24 percent of the workforce will have completed some college, compared to 29 percent in 2000. Finally, about 13 percent of the workforce will have a bachelor’s degree compared to 18 percent in 2000 while about 4 percent will have a graduate or professional degree compared to 5 percent in 2000. We asked Murdock if anything could knock his 30 percent projection askew. "A lot of things could," he replied, including whether some slowing in Hispanic immigration and/or a drop in Hispanic birth rates in the state prove permanent. Another factor, he said, would be state decisions to step up, or ratchet down, educational spending. Next, we asked an outside demographer, Elwood Carlson, a professor of sociology at Florida State University, if the methodology behind the projection seems solid. Carlson said the approach -- a cohort component survival projection model -- is a standard way of reaching such a forecast. Our ruling Hammond said "if current trends continue, by 2040, one out of three Texas workers will not have a high school diploma." Murdock’s projection is that all factors staying the same, about 30 percent of workers will lack a high school diploma. We rate Hammond’s statement as True.

pomt-07748	Under former President George W. Bush’s administration "while the population in that period grew by 10 percent, the number of jobs in the nation grew by 1 percent."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2011/feb/26/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-says-jobs-increased-1-percent-under-geor/	Democratic National Committee Chairman Tim Kaine may not have given the crowd at the Feb. 19 Jefferson-Jackson Dinner in Richmond the scoop on whether he’s running for the U.S. Senate, but he made no secret of his disdain for former President George W. Bush’s record on job creation. Kaine said in a speech that during the Bush administration "while the population in that period grew by 10 percent, the number of jobs in the nation grew by 1 percent." We wondered if that was really the case. Alec Gerlach, a DNC spokesman, couldn’t identify the source on which the former Virginia governor based his claim. So we tried to find it on our own, comparing census records from January 2001 - the month Bush was sworn in - to January 2009, when Bush left office. That can be a bit tricky because the U.S. Census Bureau only does actual counts at the start of each decade, and that doesn’t exactly line up with Bush’s term, which ran from Jan. 20, 2001 to Jan. 20, 2009. Between each census, however, the bureau provides monthly estimates on the number of people in the country. The figures show that on Jan. 1, 2001, the U.S. population was 283.7 million. By Jan.1, 2009, that number had risen to 305.8 million. Those estimates show the population increasing by about 7.8 percent, below Kaine’s claim that the population jumped by 10 percent under Bush. What about the second half of Kaine’s claim that the number of jobs only grew by 1 percent under Bush’s tenure? We turned to figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which show that in the month that the former president took office, there were about 132.5 million non-farm employees in the U.S. In January 2008, the month after the official start of the Great Recession, the total number of non-farm workers peaked at 138 million. But as the economic downturn took hold, that number declined, and by the time Bush left office in January 2009 there were 133.6 million non-farm employees. So over the course of Bush Administration, the number of non-farm workers rose by about 1.1 million, or .83 percent. That’s just shy of Kaine’s claim that the number of jobs rose by 1 percent under Bush. While Kaine’s numbers are a little off on employment and census, he’s right in suggesting that that U.S. population grew 10 times faster that jobs during George W. Bush’s presidency. Even so, several economists told us comparing raw population growth and job numbers is not a preferred way to examine job creation versus demand. That’s because not all of the new people -- such as babies born during the Bush administration -- need jobs. We were told a more meaningful measure is labor force participation: the percentage of the population between 16 and 64 that is either employed or looking for work. According to BLS, participation was at 67.2 percent when Bush took office and 65.7 percent when he left. Here’s another thing to keep in mind: Economists have told us time and again -- on this claim and others -- that the policies of presidents and governors have only minor impact on economic cycles and job creation. "They get too much credit and too much blame," said Sylvia A. Allegretto, economist at the Institute for Research on Labor & Employment at the University of California, Berkeley. Kaine’s comment didn’t address job growth in Virginia during the Bush administration. But it you’re curious, Virginia did better than the nation on Kaine’s scale. The number of nonfarm employees in the Virginia rose from 3.53 million in January 2001 to 3.7 million in January 2009 -- an increase of 4.8 percent. The U.S. Census estimate for Virginia that was closest to the start of Bush’s term was a July 1, 2001, figure showing the state had 7.19 million. A July 1, 2009, estimate shows the state’s population had grown to 7.88 million -- a 9.6 percent increase. To summarize, Kaine said that during former President George W. Bush’s administration, the U.S. population increased by 10 percent while the number of jobs went up only 1 percent. Estimates from the U.S. Census and the BLS show that during the Bush years, the population increased by 7.8 percent while the number of jobs rose by .83 percent. Kaine’s numbers are a little off his and spokesman doesn’t know where they came from. Even so, his suggestion that population growth outpaced job growth by a ratio of 10 to 1 is pretty much on the mark, so we rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-14534	"The most likely triggering cause of (microcephaly)" is the "DTaP shot, a vaccine that had been recently mandated by the Brazilian government to be injected into pregnant women."	false	/global-news/statements/2016/feb/16/centre-research-globalization/canadian-website-wrongly-links-whooping-cough-vacc/	There are many unanswered questions about the connection between the Zika virus and microcephaly, a birth defect in which the baby’s head is much smaller than expected. Not every baby of an infected woman develops this syndrome, and the mechanism by which the virus might affect the fetus is uncertain. But moving around on the Internet is an entirely different take on the tie between Zika and microcephaly. It doesn’t exist, according to certain blogs, tweets and articles on conspiracy-leaning websites. The Canadian-based Centre for Research on Globalization, a group that advances ideas it feels the "mainstream press" ignores, had an article Feb. 4, 2016, from Dr. Gary Kohls that challenged the linkage theory and said the primary suspect is DTaP, a common vaccination to prevent whooping cough (along with tetanus and diphtheria). "In the whole week of reports that I heard or read about, not a single interviewer asked about – and not a single ‘expert’ or mainstream journalists ever mentioned the most likely triggering cause of the epidemic, and that is the neurotoxic, cytotoxic, genotoxic, aluminum that was in every DTaP shot, a vaccine that had been recently mandated (early in 2015) by the Brazilian government to be injected into pregnant women – and therefore into their fetuses," Kohls wrote. So is DTaP is the "most likely triggering cause" of microcephaly? Most of Kohls’ article describes why the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pharmaceutical companies and researchers would care to blame the Zika virus rather than the vaccine, but its main point is the overlap of the microcephaly incidence and Brazil’s immunization campaign. Brazil did begin vaccinating pregnant women starting in late 2014. (Hat tip to Brazilian fact-checker Cristina Tardáguila at Lupa News.) However, according to the Brazilian Health Department press release, the vaccine they distributed was a version called Tdap. This was part of an international push to reduce whooping cough in infants. Inoculating mothers late in pregnancy allowed them to pass antibodies to their unborn children. For the rest of this fact-check, we look at Tdap. The Web article named the incorrect vaccine, but if there’s any merit to Kohls’ case -- and there isn’t -- it lies with the vaccine Brazil used. Kohl also wrote that "there are 35 other countries across the globe that have confirmed cases of Zika virus illness, but none are having any microcephaly reports." The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control does show about that number of countries and territories where Zika has been found, but in 13 of those places, there are few cases. Either no instances of Zika have been found in the past two months, or the number of cases was less than 10. So it’s a bit misleading to suggest that the absence of microcephaly disproves the link between the birth defect and the Zika virus. If we find more detailed statistics on the number of cases of Zika and microcephaly, we’ll update this item, but there’s a much bigger problem with Kohls’ statement. Evidence on the safety of Tdap The weakest part of the argument that Tdap plays a role in microcephaly is that pregnant women in the United States, and elsewhere, have been getting the vaccine and there is no hint of a connection to microcephaly. Elyse Kharbanda is a top national researcher on vaccine safety at HealthPartners Institute for Education and Research in Minneapolis. "Our research has not shown any link between Tdap vaccination in pregnant women and microcephaly in their children," Kharbanda told us. Melissa Brower in the CDC press office reiterated that point. "Our safety monitoring is continuous," Brower said. "We have not observed any unusual or unexpected patterns of reporting that would indicate a potential safety problem with maternal Tdap vaccination and microcephaly as a birth outcome." A 2015 study published in the peer-reviewed Journal of the American Medical Association included over 29,000 pregnant women in six states. It found no problems of any birth defects for any woman who was vaccinated with Tdap during pregnancy. Another JAMA study looked at over 26,000 pregnant women in California and reached the same conclusion. Researchers at the Vanderbilt Vaccine Research Program further affirm the safety of Tdap. Director and specialist in pediatric infectious diseases Buddy Creech said nothing shows any link between the vaccine and microcephaly or any other birth defect. Creech also noted that the vaccine is given later in pregnancy, between weeks 27 and 36. That timing is important. "Most organ development and structural changes are occurring in the first trimester," Creech said. "It’s after the period of most intense organ development, so it removes the question of whether a vaccine caused congenital heart disease, etc." However, the CDC says in some cases, microcephaly can occur after the first trimester, so in theory, a vaccination could overlap with the onset of microcephaly. But that doesn’t change the rest of the research pattern. The United Kingdom launched a vaccination program in 2012, making Tdap available to about 700,000 pregnant women. Researchers looked at the impact on about 20,000 of them and found no increase in pregnancy risks. On a related note, the New England Journal of Medicine reports that the Zika virus was found in the brain tissue of an aborted fetus suffering from microcephaly. While this says nothing about the role of Tdap, it does directly link the Zika virus to a particular birth defect. We contacted the editors at the Centre for Research on Globalization and they said they forwarded our questions to Kohls. If we hear back, we’ll update this item. Our ruling An online article on the website of the Centre for Research of Globalization said the DTaP vaccine is the mostly likely cause of microcephaly in Brazil. First of all, Brazil used Tdap, a slightly different version of the vaccine. More important, not a bit of evidence supports the assertion that either variety lies behind microcephaly. Many thousands of pregnant women in the United States and around the world have been getting this vaccine for at least five years and multiple studies have found no ill effects on their babies. Not a single study has raised a red flag for any birth defect and certainly not microcephaly. In addition, administering the vaccine later in pregnancy reduces the likelihood that it will interfere with fetal development. The statement is inaccurate in every respect including naming the wrong version of the vaccine used in Brazil. We rate it False.

pomt-14830	"If we pass immigration reform, it will make wages go up on average $250 for the average household."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2015/nov/20/martin-omalley/gov-martin-omalley-says-immigration-reform-will-bo/	While presidential candidate and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley was in Austin on a campaign stop, he said immigration reform would pay off for all Americans through their paychecks. In a Nov. 12, 2015 interview on "Overheard with Evan Smith," O’Malley discussed President Barack Obama’s executive order on immigration, and whether he would take similar action. O’Malley told Smith he believes the country needs immigration reform because it’s "something important for the economy of the United States." "If we pass immigration reform, it will make wages go up on average $250 for the average household," he elaborated. "Why? Because you’re getting 11 million people in many times off-the-books jobs onto the open economy of the United States of America." The number of undocumented immigrants in the United States has hovered around 11 million since 2009, according to a July 2015 report from the Pew Research Center, evaluating data through 2014. Undocumented immigrants make up 5.1 percent of the U.S. labor force, Pew reported in July 2015. We don’t and can’t check predictions. Still, we wondered whether it was true, based on research, that immigration reform could mean $250 more for the average American household, as O’Malley said. Long-term figure O’Malley’s campaign press secretary, Haley Morris, said the governor got the $250 figure from a July 2013 White House report, published in support of a 2013 Senate immigration reform bill. That report, "The Economic Benefits of Fixing Our Broken Immigration System," states that "in the long run, the Senate bill raises wages for all groups of workers by boosting productivity." The White House’s conclusion relies on the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office’s analysis of the economic impact of that bill, the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act. The $250 figure O’Malley cites is certainly long term. It refers to a rise in wages between 2013 and 2033 – and doesn’t otherwise estimate year-by-year changes. As the White House report breaks it down: "CBO estimates that real wages will be 0.5 percent higher in 2033 than projected under current law. In today’s terms, that would be equivalent to an additional $250 of income for the median American household." Wages would increase partly because immigration reform would lead to a higher rate of return on capital throughout the next two decades. A web search led us to George Borjas, a labor economist specializing in immigration issues at Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government. He questioned the assumptions behind the CBO’s calculation. To reach its conclusion about immigration reform’s effect on wages, the CBO report uses a "positivity effect," a name for the effect of a correlation between state GDP and immigration. However, Borjas says, the relationship between higher state GDP and immigration could be correlation, not causation, which would put the $250 figure into question. Borjas, who reviewed the report at our request, said: "Maybe immigrants are smart enough to realize they should settle in states with high productivity." Other research released when the bill in question was in the Senate in 2013 supported the CBO’s analysis. An August 2013 article from the Brookings Institution compared the bill’s potential effects to immigration’s historical impact on the economy, finding that "on average, previous waves of immigrants tended to boost American wages." On the other hand, neither analysis said American households would see an immediate or steady spike in income. Lower wages in the short term Even if the long-term $250 figure holds true, the CBO concluded that comprehensive immigration reform actually would lead to lower average wages in the short-term before boosting overall productivity. In the first decade, according to its analysis, average wages would decrease by 0.1 percent. By the CBO's estimates, average wages would be slightly lower than under current law through 2024 before they rise above current wages the following decade. Comprehensive immigration reform also would lead to a temporary imbalance in the labor market, causing slightly higher unemployment through 2020, when the labor market would adjust. Wages would be lower at first, the CBO says, because growth of the workforce would outpace capital available. In addition, new workers would be less skilled and have lower wages, affecting average wages for the entire workforce. Brookings pointed out that wage decreases would be larger for workers with some high school or only a high school diploma, who would be more likely to compete with new workers, compared to college graduates. Other considerations Immigration reform’s effects on the economy extend beyond immediate and long-term effects on average wages. As Gregory Wright, an assistant professor of economics at University of California-Merced who studies international trade and migration, points out, "Immigrants are very entrepreneurial relative to the native population, and high-skill immigrants tend to generate a disproportionate number of patents and are more innovative by other measures." In another section of its report, the CBO specifies that immigrants receive patents at twice the rate of the native-born U.S. population. Additionally, Wright says, immigration reform would create work through "demand-side channels." "Moving undocumented workers into the open would allow them to raise their own standard of living and they would subsequently demand more housing, education and generally more of all goods and services, which generates work for others," Wright said. Increasing the sheer number of people in the workforce raises output and consumption, or GDP, Wright says. The CBO estimated that immigration reform would raise real GDP by 3.3 percent in 2023 and by 5.4 percent in 2033. Immigrants entering the official workforce will then pay taxes, supporting the aging U.S. population, Wright added. Our ruling O’Malley’s claim that immigration reform would "make wages go up on average $250 for the average household" would not be accurate anytime soon. The $250 in question is a calculation based on mathematical assumptions -- assumptions that some question -- that refers to a long-term result over two decades. In the near term, the same analysis projects wages would dip slightly. O’Malley’s statement contains an element of truth, but the wage-raising conclusion is misleading. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-08326	"Of those 850,000 (new Texas) jobs, most were public-sector jobs and minimum-wage jobs."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2010/oct/29/bill-white/bill-white-says-most-texas-jobs-added-during-rick-/	Gov. Rick Perry frequently crows about the Texas economy, lately saying that in his near-decade as governor, Texas has gained more than 850,000 jobs. In an Oct. 15 interview, Perry's Democratic opponent didn't challenge that number. However, Bill White told the Texas Tribune: "Of those 850,000 jobs, most were public-sector jobs and minimum-wage jobs." Huh. We hadn't heard that. Katy Bacon, White's spokeswoman, later said that White thinks that being able to attract high-wage jobs is crucial to the state's long-term economic growth. Texas is a national leader in low-wage jobs, she said, sounding a down note that reminded us of Democratic lieutenant governor nominee Linda Chavez-Thompson's claim that Texas leads the nation in its share of minimum-wage employees, a statement we rated True in May. In 2009, 474,000 Texas workers — 8.5 percent of the hourly work force — earned the federal minimum wage or less, according to a March 11 news release from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. That was the highest proportion of low-wage earners in the 50 states and the District of Columbia, the release said. We wondered how many of those jobs were created on Perry's watch, per White's claim that most of the employment gains touted by the governor were jobs that paid minimum wage or were in the public sector. First, some background: The 850,000 figure touted by Perry and dissected by White reflects the net increase in nonfarm jobs in the state from January 2001, soon after Perry became governor, through June 2010 (actual gain = 853,400). In September, we rated True the statement in Perry's "Texas: Open for Business" TV ad that "we've created more than 850,000 jobs, more than all the other states combined." However, updated statistics show that through August, the net jobs gained had decreased to 818,500. We also noted that the Texas State Data Center has projected that the Texas population grew by about 4 million between 2001 and 2010. When asked to back up White's breakdown of the job gains, the White campaign provided a spreadsheet of calculations using bureau data to show the rise in both government-sector jobs and minimum-wage jobs in Texas. The campaign looked at several time periods, including the one favored by the Perry campaign, January 2001 to June 2010, and others that incorporated the most recent data available, through August 2010. In an accompanying letter, Tom McCasland, a research analyst for White's campaign, said their calculations showed that government and minimum-wage jobs accounted for 62.8 percent to 69.5 percent of the total job gains. For the time period corresponding to the 850,000 figure (January 2001 to June 2010), the relevant portion of the job gains was 67.5 percent, according to McCasland's information. But in reviewing their math, we found several wrinkles: 1) The bureau's information on public sector and minimum-wage jobs come from different sources that gather data at different time intervals, said Cheryl Abbot, the bureau's regional economist in Dallas. The employment information by sector is compiled monthly while the minimum-wage job situation is examined annually. In this case, that means the time periods for the two categories don't match exactly. 2) Our calculation of the increase in minimum-wage jobs in Texas during Perry's tenure (259,000) didn't match White's (267,000). Why the discrepancy? We used the bureau's most recent information to compare the number of minimum-wage jobs in Texas in 2001 and 2009. McCasland said he had used older bureau information and had compared 2002 with 2009. 3) Another issue: The federal minimum wage increased three times between 2001, when it was $5.15 an hour, and 2010 — rising to $5.85 in 2007, to $6.55 in 2008, and to $7.25 in 2009. These stair-step jumps brought some above-minimum wage jobs down into the minimum-wage-or-below fold. During the years the minimum wage held steady at $5.15 (1998-2006), the number of Texas workers making at or below that amount actually declined slightly, except for a small uptick in 2003. From 2006 to 2009, Abbot said, "just over 300,000 more Texans" entered that low-paid category. However, "we have no way of determining if those are actually 'new jobs' or, more likely, workers whose pay rate is now equal to or below the increased federal minimum wage," she said. That's a fair point, McCasland said. Then he made one of his own: "Because Gov. Perry continues to talk about net job creation, it is appropriate to look at how many of those net jobs end up as minimum-wage jobs, either because they were created as such or because they become minimum-wage jobs by failing to keep up with inflation." Lastly, we realized White's calculations assume that government jobs and minimum-wage jobs are entirely separate categories; what if there's overlap and White counted some jobs twice? Abbot told us that's possible but that there's no way to know because the bureau doesn't have data broken down that way. "The best I can tell you is that at the national level — which may or may not represent Texas at all — among all hourly-paid public sector workers, 2.3 percent were paid at or below the prevailing minimum wage" in 2009, Abbot said. Texas Workforce Commission spokeswoman Ann Hatchitt told us the commission doesn't keep detailed information on minimum-wage workers in Texas, including how many are in the public sector. What we know: Texas added 853,400 jobs from January 2001 through June 2010. Of those, 308,800 were government jobs. That's about 36 percent. To prove White's statement that most (more than 50 percent) of the new jobs were public-sector and minimum wage, an additional 117,901 would have had to be jobs that paid at or below minimum wage. But we can't calculate that because the bureau's count of minimum-wage jobs doesn't discriminate between brand-new jobs and pre-existing ones that were swept into the count when the minimum wage went up. We asked experts including University of Texas economist Daniel Hamermesh and Bruce Kellison, associate director of UT's Bureau of Business Research, whether we could make a ballpark estimate of how many of the job gains under Perry were minimum wage. Each of them said nope, primarily because employment data doesn't break it out. Summing up: White's campaign presented raw numbers suggesting that about two-thirds of the jobs added on Perry's watch were either government-sector or minimum-wage. But that methodology lacks critical information that could easily lead to a different conclusion. That's why we rate the statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-15033	"Since 2008, U.S. crude oil output has increased by over 80 percent, an increase of over 4 million barrels a day. That is the fastest increase in U.S. history."	true	/florida/statements/2015/oct/02/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-claims-us-has-enjoyed-fastest-crude-oil-p/	Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush said in his recently released energy plan that the United States should take advantage of its resurgent status as "a global energy superpower." Thanks to new means of extracting oil such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, there’s been an unprecedented spike in domestic oil production, the former Florida governor said. "Since 2008, U.S. crude oil output has increased by over 80 percent, an increase of over 4 million barrels a day. That is the fastest increase in U.S. history," his plan read. Has oil production really seen the fastest increase in the nation’s history, topping 80 percent or higher since 2008? It sure has, reversing a decline that began back in 1986. We went to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which keeps monthly and annual statistics for crude oil production. They said that in 2008, the United States produced 5 million barrels per day, a figure that has jumped to more than 9 million per day in 2015. A Bush spokeswoman confirmed to us that was the same data they were using when drawing up the energy plan. As you can see, that’s a pretty steep spike in production over a seven-year period: The change is largely because of the reasons Bush gave, according to EIA spokesman Jonathan Cogan. Better technology like fracking and horizontal drilling, which makes extraction from geological formations like layers of shale easier, has led to an overall increase in output. Relatively high oil prices (about $140 per barrel in 2008, as opposed to less than $50 recently) also helped lead to the ramp-up in production. You may recall that gas prices reached a single-day high in 2008, with a gallon costing $4.11 that July. The highest-ever nationwide annual average of $3.60 per gallon was in 2012. Mark Perry, a University of Michigan-Flint economics professor working with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, agreed that Bush’s take is accurate. He said based on EIA numbers through July, U.S. crude production has gone up 83 percent since 2008. That bumps up to 88 percent if you measure the current 2015 average of almost 9.4 million barrels per day. (We will note that 2008 includes a storm-related drop in September, when hurricanes Ike and Gustav churned through the Gulf of Mexico and production dropped to less than 4 million barrels per day.) "It’s pretty clear that the production increase from 2008-15 ... has been the largest production increase ever in U.S. history in such a short period of time," he said via email. From 2009 to 2014, the increase in oil production didn’t bring the price drop economists expected, Perry said. Now that oil prices have dropped so much recently, we’re just starting to see production back off. The latest EIA data showed production has dropped 144,000 barrels per day since July, with estimates saying it’s going to continue to decrease. "It took a while for the price to finally catch up to the increased U.S. production, and now we’re in an adjustment period," Perry said. He said the slowdown was temporary and "will likely be followed by another period of increased production in a year or two when oil prices go back up above $50 and stay there." Our ruling Bush said, "Since 2008, U.S. crude oil output has increased by over 80 percent, an increase of over 4 million barrels a day. That is the fastest increase in U.S. history." That’s accurate, as high prices and new extraction methods have led to a significant increase in the amount of crude oil the country produces. Depending on how you calculate it, production has gone up 83 percent through July, or 88 percent if you use the current 2015 average. Production is currently dipping downward, but it’s easily the fastest increase in a seven-year span in U.S. history. We rate Bush’s statement True.

pomt-14016	Says "Obama wants to give (Iran) nuclear weapons and Michael Bennet, he was all for it."	pants on fire!	/colorado/statements/2016/jun/02/jon-keyser/keyser-says-obama-bennet-want-give-iran-nukes-deal/	In an attention-grabbing TV ad, Colorado Republican U.S. Senate candidate Jon Keyser accuses President Barack Obama and Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet of wanting to give nuclear weapons to Iran. The ad opens with a narrator highlighting Keyser’s role as a military intelligence officer in Iraq, where he "conducted capture and kill missions to remove high value targets in urban areas." "For us, Baghdad was the roughest. We weren’t fighting amateurs; we were fighting a vicious enemy armed by Iran," Keyser says. Then he pivots to the claim we’re fact-checking: "Now Obama wants to give these guys nuclear weapons and Michael Bennet, he was all for it." Keyser is among five Republicans vying to win the June 28 primary and the right to take on Bennet in the general election. He’s not the only Republican attacking a Democratic opponent this election season on the Iran deal, which the Obama administration and five other nations approved in 2015. Earlier this month, PolitiFact Florida issued a False rating when a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate said two Democratic opponents "supported President Obama’s disastrous deal, which allows Iran to produce a nuclear weapon." Those Democrats did support the deal, but the intention was clearly not to allow Iran to produce a nuclear weapon. When we rechecked the terms for this fact-check, we found that was still the case. Keyser’s ad goes a step further to say Obama and Bennet want Iran to produce such a weapon. That incendiary characterization is also not true. We contacted the Keyser campaign. A spokesman did not provide evidence to back up the claim. The deal’s terms The deal, which was struck in July 2015, essentially lifts international economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for the nation agreeing to curb nuclear technologies and allowing nuclear-weapons inspections for 10 to 25 years. A sticking point for critics is that while Iran has to give up 97 percent of its enriched uranium stockpile and most of its centrifuges that could enrich more, that capability is not gone entirely. Iran can have a reduced number of operating centrifuges for 10 years, but research and development on advanced centrifuges will be limited. Uranium enrichment is supposed to be kept at levels unsuitable for weapons use for the next 15 years. Iran also can no longer produce plutonium, the other element that could create a bomb. To make sure Iran is doing what it agreed to do, international inspectors will monitor known nuclear sites for those 15 years. They also can enter an undeclared site suspected of nuclear use, although Iran could take up to 24 days to allow inspectors into such sites. There’s been plenty of debate about how verifiable such activity can be. Surveillance of centrifuge production areas is slated to last 20 years, and uranium mills and mines will be monitored for 25 years. Iran also has to stick to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that it signed in 1974, thereby no longer pursuing nuclear weapons. It must follow further international treaties, as well. Theoretically, Iran must abide by those treaties for good, even after the 25-year inspection time limit passes. Several experts have told PolitiFact in recent months that as long as Iran adheres to the terms of the agreement, they cannot build a nuclear weapon. Some experts have said it’s reasonable to suspect Iran could disregard the agreement and again pursue a weapon. But even if the United States had won tougher terms, any agreement only works if the country follows the guidelines. Not coming to an agreement at all would have let Iran’s militarized nuclear progress continue unabated. A key mechanism of the agreement is that it lengthened Iran’s "breakout time" — how long it would take Iran to produce a nuclear weapon if it returned to building one. While some estimates put that time at two to three months before the deal, the breakout time is generally considered to be about a year under the terms of the deal. "It does not have the uranium enrichment capacity to produce enough bomb-grade material," Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, has told PolitiFact. "It would take over a year. We would detect any attempt to do that within weeks, if not days." Bennet was among a majority of Democrats who voted three times over 10 days in September to successfully block a Republican resolution to kill the Iran deal. According to the New York Times, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called multiple votes on the measure to reject the Iran accord. In part, he wanted to see if he could win a few votes needed to break the deadlock, the Times reported, but the votes also forced Democrats to repeatedly endorse a deal that they’d have to defend this election year. In a statement after his vote, Bennet said, "My conclusion is that the (Iran agreement) is more likely to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon than the plausible alternatives." Bennet added that the deal "has flaws," and he has co-sponsored legislation to "clarify better how we will respond if Iran cheats on this deal." The legislation, which remains in committee, seeks to create a "strategy with our partners to ensure that Iran appreciates the consequences of its violations, for the next 15 years and beyond," he said in a separate statement. Our ruling Keyser said, "Obama wants to give these guys nuclear weapons and Michael Bennet, he was all for it." Keyser portrays the agreement as a plot to arm Iran with nukes when it’s designed to do exactly the opposite. The terms of the deal forbid Iran from pursuing a militarized nuclear program. There are limits on uranium enrichment and facility uses, and Iran must allow inspections. It also must abide by terms of international treaties to not seek weapons even after the deal’s guidelines end. To develop nuclear weapons, Iran would have to either break the terms of the agreement or else wait it out and start building one anew once the deal’s provisions have expired (which would be counter to the provisions of treaties that predated this deal). It's ridiculous to say Obama and Bennet wanted this deal because they want to give Iran a nuclear weapon.

pomt-08492	Debbie Jackow "unlike her opponent ... WILL NOT de-fund the 20/20 land program."	false	/florida/statements/2010/oct/10/debbie-jackow/debbie-jackow-says-opponent-doesnt-support-land-pr/	Lab tech and political newcomer Debbie Jackow's campaign mailer touts what she is not. She is not her opponent, two-term incumbent Lee County Commissioner Tammy Hall. Jackow lists her bulleted campaign promises under the header, "Unlike her opponent Debbie WILL NOT..." • Be a tax and spend commissioner • Raise property taxes • Be owned by special interests • De-fund the 20/20 land program That last line about the county's Conservation 20/20 program caught our attention. We wondered, is that a fair accusation? Voters approved the 20/20 land program in a 1996 referendum to help the county buy up and exempt environmentally sensitive land from development. The program taxes 50 cents for every $1,000 of assessed property value. In 14 years, Lee County taxpayers have spent $286.5 million to preserve 37 square miles of land. Hall has always voted to approve funding for the program. She voted for it again this year, and it's approved through 2011. We looked for evidence to support Jackow's claim that Hall planned in the future to pull funds from Conservation 20/20. We pulled footage from the July 6, 2010, commission meeting where commissioners voted to fund the program. This meeting and the media's coverage of it, Jackow said, were the basis of her accusation. Clerk of Court Charlie Green suggested at the start of the meeting that the commission divert $27 million from Conservation 20/20 this year ­to help fill the county's budget deficit. Hall's only response was to invite Green to stay at the meeting through the vote on the 14-year-old program. Two hours into the meeting, Hall thanked Commissioner Ray Judah for his support of Conservation 20/20. She then said, "I support, I have always supported the (Conservation) 20/20 program." She led a unanimous vote to continue funding the program. So where did Jackow's accusation come from? "It was in The News-Press," Jackow said. "(Hall) said she would consider touching the 20/20 money." A July 7 News-Press article said, "Commission Chairwoman Tammy Hall said the board should be looking ahead to further cost-cutting measures. She cited Clerk of Court Charlie Green's idea of putting a halt to the county's land conservation purchasing program and using its tax dollars to help plug the budget hole." A look at the meeting footage shows Hall suggesting the county continue to make cuts. Without expressing support for Green's idea, she also states, "The clerk has given us ideas on how to maybe put things on hold and transfer over, but that is our goal ... that the average citizen in Lee County does not see a tax increase." Hall offered no further comment on Green's suggestion during the meeting. Hall has supported Conservation 20/20 every year she's been in office, including the current year. To say Hall is considering de-funding the program would be a stretch. Saying she has de-funded the program is clearly incorrect. We rate this statement False.

pomt-11863	"We are spending more on affordable housing than we're spending on Dix Park right now."	true	/north-carolina/statements/2017/nov/02/nancy-mcfarlane/mayor-says-raleigh-spending-more-housing-dix-park/	Raleigh Mayor Nancy McFarlane’s opponent says the City Council isn’t doing enough to sustain and build affordable housing. Her opponent is Charles Francis, a Democrat who called for a runoff election after mayoral candidates failed to get the 50 percent of the vote required to secure a win. McFarlane, who’s unaffiliated, got 48 percent of the vote on Oct. 10. Francis got 36 percent and Republican Paul Fitts got 12 percent. In a televised debate on Oct. 20, Francis suggested the city shouldn’t focus all of its energy on Dix Park when more basic needs go unaddressed. Dix Park is a 308-acre property just south of downtown Raleigh that the city bought from the state in 2014 for $52 million. McFarlane defended the city’s work on Dix Park, as well as the council’s investment in housing – an area where Francis has said Raleigh should be doing more. "We are spending more on affordable housing than we're spending on Dix Park right now," she said. The claim is suspect not only because the city bought Dix Park in 2014 but because Dix Park and affordable housing have shared an identical funding source since summer 2016. The City Council last year raised the property tax rate by two cents – one cent to generate money for affordable housing and the other cent to pay off Dix Park debt. Each cent generated about $5.7 million for its respective purpose in fiscal year 2016-17, which ended this June. The city expects to raise about $6 million for each cause this fiscal year, which ends next June. So, with that said, why did McFarlane claim that the city is paying more for affordable housing than Dix Park? Let’s judge McFarlane on this fiscal year, since she referenced current spending. Paying for Dix Park The city bought the Dix property with the intention of transforming it into a "destination" park that downtown residents or workers can walk to and other Wake County residents would want to drive to. The city hopes to inspire locals to participate in the planning process and there have been several events at the property. Francis has criticized McFarlane and other city leaders, saying they seem more enthusiastic about developing Dix Park than fixing roads or putting air conditioning in city gyms. Kate Pearce, the city’s point person for Dix Park, says the city budgeted $300,000 and $307,000, respectively, for ongoing maintenance at the park each of the past two years. Those figures include mowing, landscaping, clean-up and salaries of park staff members, she said. The planning process and most of the programs held on the Dix property to this point have been paid for by Raleigh’s nonprofit partner, the Dix Park Conservancy. The conservancy signed a deal with the city last year promising to pay at least $2 million of the planning effort and may commit up to an additional $1 million for planning-related activities, she said. So let’s recap: This fiscal year, the city expects to spend about $6 million on Dix-related debt and an additional $307,000 for Dix Park maintenance – combining for a total of $6.3 million in spending. What is affordable housing? First, an explanation: "affordable housing" is a blanket term that can refer to anything from living spaces owned or subsidized by the city, county or federal government to homes owned by the private sector for which low-income residents can pay on their own. Wake County uses the term to describe housing that can be bought or rented by people earning less than 60 percent of Wake's annual median income, $78,800, which comes out to $47,280 a year. Roughly 126,000 Wake residents earn less than that, county statistics show. McFarlane referenced city spending on affordable housing. But even that can be complicated to track. Not only does Raleigh spend money it generates on its own, it’s also tasked with spending money it gets from the federal government. City spending Larry Jarvis, director of Raleigh’s housing and neighborhoods department, says it’s hard to compare year-by-year affordable housing spending. For instance, a voter-approved bond referendum in 2011 set aside $16 million for affordable housing with some of the funds subject to annual expenditure and the rest committed to large affordable housing projects that sometimes take three years to actually complete. "For large tax credit projects like Washington Terrace, local funds are committed or encumbered when the projects are awarded tax credits by the (North Carolina Housing Finance Agency) and then ‘spent’ during construction," Jarvis wrote in an email. "All of the funds have been encumbered for specific affordable housing projects and the funds will be spent as construction progresses." In fiscal year 2017-18, the city budgeted $7.24 million on affordable housing units or housing-related spending, said Tonya Walton, a senior budget and management analyst for the city. The city will spend another $6 million in federal funds on affordable housing and other community development activities, Jarvis added. Our ruling McFarlane said the city is "spending more on affordable housing than we're spending on Dix Park right now." The city’s $52 million purchase of the Dix property was certainly a big one. But the city’s is paying for it incrementally and McFarlane is right that the city this year is spending more on affordable housing – $7.24 million – than it is on Dix Park – $6.3 million.

pomt-06403	Barack Obama is the "First President to terminate America’s ability to put a man in space."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/28/chain-email/chain-e-mail-claims-obama-first-president-terminat/	A reader recently forwarded us a chain e-mail critical of President Barack Obama that’s been making the rounds. It’s headlined, "Barack Obama's 32 Month Report Card." "Mr. Hope and Change wants to create a nation humbled; humiliated, casting-aside capitalism and individual freedoms for one where ‘we the people’ are government controlled," says the chain e-mail, which is attributed to a Rich Carroll. "This would be a system that genuflects mediocrity, steals personal aspiration and opportunity, and punishes those who strive to succeed." The e-mail proceeds to offer roughly three dozen "firsts" about Obama, all of them highly unflattering. We can’t check each and every claim in the e-mail, but we decided instead to spot-check a few claims we hadn’t seen before. (Here’s the full text of the e-mail we received.) The one we’ll check here is that Obama is the "First President to terminate America’s ability to put a man in space." On July 21, 2011, space shuttle Atlantis arrived at its home port, NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, concluding the last-ever shuttle mission. With the end of the space shuttle program, it’s correct that the United States no longer has the ability to send an astronaut into space by a domestic launch. The hope is that commercial companies based in the U.S. will be ready to launch by 2016, if Congress provides NASA with adequate funding, said Marcia Smith of spacepolicyonline.com. NASA's own system is not likely to be ready until at least 2020, though that might be accelerated by a couple of years at most, she said. So, for at least five years, the United States will not be able to send astronauts into orbit. In the interim, American astronauts are slated to blast off on Russian spacecraft, according to what NASA told PolitiFact Texas the last time we checked this issue. Unlike the reusable space shuttles, the Russian crafts -- which are launched from a base in Kazakhstan -- are disposable. So the chain e-mail contains a grain of truth that the U.S. no longer has the "ability to put a man in space" -- at least from American soil. (The author of the e-mail would have been more accurate if he'd made clear that we’re unable to do domestic launches specifically.) Still, containing that grain of truth doesn’t mean the e-mail’s claim is correct. Initially, we focused on the question of whether it was fair to blame Obama singlehandedly for the current state of affairs for U.S. manned launches. Knowing how long it takes space programs to come to fruition, we were skeptical that it Obama deserved all the blame. When we contacted space experts for their view, they agreed that it would be unfair to blame only Obama. "President George W. Bush directed NASA to shut down the shuttle program, with full knowledge that there would be a multi-year gap for human spaceflight," said Edward Ellegood, a space policy analyst at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. "Although President Obama could have tried to reverse that directive, he opted instead to promote the near-term development of U.S. commercial capabilities for transportation to and from low-earth orbit (which includes the International space station) and, in the longer term, to develop a heavy-lift NASA-operated launch system for exploration missions beyond low-earth orbit." So Ellegood sees several problems with the chain e-mail’s claim. Obama did not terminate the shuttle capability -- rather, the timing was set in motion by his predecessor, Bush. And once in office, Obama added two shuttle missions in order to reduce the duration of the gap and also worked to get the shuttle’s commercial-based replacement lined up. But there’s another fact that’s even more damning to the e-mail’s claim: Having a gap in U.S. space flights carrying astronauts actually happened once before, making the claim completely untrue. The United States had no ability to launch astronauts into space from 1975 -- the year of the Apollo Soyuz Test Project -- until 1981, when the space shuttle program went live. "One could blame (President Richard) Nixon, who ended Apollo and approved the shuttle, or (President Gerald) Ford, who didn't disagree with Nixon, though by 1974 it might have been too late to rescue Apollo," Smith said. "Usually it's Nixon who is ‘blamed’ for that. By the time Carter came into office, Apollo had already ended and shuttle couldn't be accelerated. It actually was supposed to be ready by 1979, but NASA couldn't pull it off." That the author of the e-mail made this charge against Obama is evidence that "no one really noticed the original gap at the time, or remembers it today, even though it was a six-year gap," Smith said. Our ruling Whether one wants to blame Bush or Obama for our current predicament turns out to be irrelevant to the question raised in the e-mail. Richard Nixon, perhaps in conjunction with Gerald Ford, would be the one to qualify for the unwanted title of "first president to terminate America’s ability to put a man in space" -- not Obama.

pomt-11419	The default rate for college students has grown from 40 percent 10 years ago to about 50 percent today, and "perhaps as many as 800,000 young Ohioans are facing default on their student loans."	false	/ohio/statements/2018/mar/20/dennis-kucinich/ohio-governors-race-dennis-kucinich-misleads-about/	Former Ohio congressman Dennis Kucinich says that young people look with trepidation toward the future because they can’t afford college. He has promised if elected governor he will make it possible for every young Ohioan to attend a two-year college tuition free. "The default rate for students 10 years ago was about 40 percent," he wrote on his campaign website. But now, the "default rate approaches 50 percent." His website also stated "perhaps as many as 800,000 young Ohioans are facing default on their student loans." Kucinich is competing in the May 8 Democratic primary for governor. We fact-checked his statistics and found he has a point that student debt is a big problem, but he flubbed some of the numbers about the default rate and then used those to estimate the numbers of Ohioans facing debt. Default rates Kucinich’s claim that "the default rate for students 10 years ago was about 40 percent" is based on a credible report, but Kucinich presented the number as a default rate in the past while the report cites that figure as a prediction for the future. A January report by Columbia professor Judith Scott-Clayton for the Brookings Institution analyzed national data on student debt and repayment, released by the U.S. Education Department in October 2017. Scott-Clayton projected that about 40 percent of the students who entered college in 2004 will default by 2023, based on patterns of defaults from earlier cohorts. While Kucinich wrote about student debt as a broad problem, the Brookings report said default rates are higher for students who attend for-profit colleges and for students of color. "The results suggest that diffuse concern with rising levels of average debt is misplaced," Scott-Clayton wrote wrote. Scott-Clayton, the author of the Brookings report, told PolitiFact that her projections do not adjust for changes in student composition, institutional choices, or loan characteristics that might relate to the likelihood of default. It is possible the actual rates will be higher or lower. Sandy Baum, who wrote a report for the College Board, sent PolitiFact data showing that the two-year cohort default rate was nowhere near 40 percent in the past couple of decades. The high point in the two-year cohort default rate between 1987 and 2010 was 22.4 percent in 1990. (Default rates are now measured in three-year cohorts.) We found no data to support Kucinich’s claim that the student default rate approaches 50 percent today. The U.S. Education Department released data in 2017 which showed the national default rate for the 2014 cohort was 11.5 percent. (It was 13.6 percent in Ohio.) 'Perhaps as many as 800,000 young Ohioans are facing default.' The Kucinich campaign arrived at the estimated prediction of 800,000 in default based on back-of-the-envelope calculations, which are not borne out by actual data. A Kucinich campaign spokesman said that 14 percent of the national population are federal student loan borrowers, or 44 million. If that same percentage holds true for Ohio, then 1.6 million Ohio residents have federal student loans. Using their estimate that half will default (which we found no data to support) would bring the number to 800,000. We went in search of actual numbers of Ohioans who defaulted. U.S. Education Department state data for the FY 2014 cohort showed that 28,955 Ohio borrowers defaulted, or 13.6 percent Mark Kantrowitz, a national expert on student debt, said that while the 800,000 number isn’t justified, Kucinich has a point about the problem of student debt. "Generally, the burden of paying for college has shifted from the federal and state government to families because of a failure of government support to keep pace with increases in college costs on a per-student, inflation-adjusted basis," he said. "Since family income has been flat and loans are the only form of aid that has any degree of elasticity, this has driven annual increases in borrowing to pay for college." Our ruling Kucinich’s campaign website said the default rate for college students has grown from 40 percent 10 years ago to about 50 percent today, and that "perhaps as many as 800,000 young Ohioans are facing default on their student loans." That’s based on a report that predicted that 40 percent of students who entered college in 2004 will default by 2023. So that’s a prediction about the future -- not a default rate for 10 years ago. We found no data to support Kucinich’s claim that about 50 percent of students default today. U.S. Education Department data showed that the default rate nationally for the 2014 cohort was 11.5 percent. Using the 50 percent figure and extrapolating from population numbers, the Kucinich campaign concluded that 800,000 face default on their loans. That figure is not supported by actual data.

pomt-09827	"Under the plan, for the first five years your employer not only has to keep the coverage, but you can't migrate to the public plan."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/28/anthony-weiner/employers-dont-have-keep-coverage-under-health-ref/	Rep. Anthony Weiner went on the Fox News Channel to offer a spirited defense of House Democrats' plans for health reform, taking questions on the show Fox & Friends . Brian Kilmeade, one of the Fox & Friends hosts, asked him, "What if your company who gives you health care insurance, which you know happens more often than not, says: 'You know what? I'm looking at my budget. I'm going to go the public option, because it's cheaper. The quality might not be as good, but when I come to balance my books, I'm still offering my people insurance. The quality is dropped and I save some money.'" "Prohibited under the plan," said Weiner, a Democrat from Brooklyn, N.Y. "Under the plan, for the first five years your employer not only has to keep the coverage, but you can't migrate to the public plan. The concern was we didn't want a giant movement." Weiner's point that employers can't immediately shift workers to the public option is right. But almost all the other details are wrong. We've read the 1,000-page House bill and there is no rule that employers have to keep coverage for five years, for example. We asked Weiner's office for an explanation and didn't hear back. To examine the rest of his comments, let's recap the basics of the House bill: Employer-provided insurance stays in place. Individuals and small businesses go to a new national health care exchange, where they can comparison shop for health insurance. Private insurers compete on the exchange, but one of the plans is a public option, a low-cost, basic insurance plan offered by the government. During year 1, small businesses with 10 or fewer employees can use the exchange. During the year 2, it's 20 or fewer employees. During year 3, a health choices commissioner has the authority to phase in businesses with more employees. The legislation doesn't say if or when every employer would be allowed on the exchange. The health bill would also set new standards for coverage, requiring insurers to cover basic procedures and adhere to new consumer protection rules. Employer-sponsored insurance will have to meet those same consumer protection rules, but they have a five-year grace period before they have to comply. (See Section 102 on page 17 of the House bill.) So employers can keep their current plans for up to five years before the plans have to conform to the new rules. But there's nothing in the bill that forces them to keep their current coverage. They can change insurance providers just as they do now. Only if they choose to drop coverage would they have to pay an additional tax. Weiner also says, "you can't migrate to the public plan." That's true only if you're talking about large employers having access to the exchange. Individuals are allowed to shop on the exchange right away, if they're willing to drop their employer-sponsored coverage. "You" might not want to, though: In most cases, employers pay part of their workers' insurance premiums. A worker with a large employer who drops coverage from their job to go to the exchange would lose that contribution. In fact, this point also undermines the premise of Kilmeade's question. He said that if he's an employer, he can "go the public option, because it's cheaper. The quality might not be as good, but when I come to balance my books, I'm still offering my people insurance." This is not an accurate description of how employers are allowed to use the exchange. The bill clearly states that employers cannot select a particular insurance plan for their employees on the exchange. (See Section 202, page 81.) The employers can contribute a set amount to help cover their employees, but they can't force their workers to pick the public option if the workers are willing to pay more to get private insurance. So the idea that employers can sign their workers up for the public option to save money is wrong. Getting back to Weiner's statement, he said that an employer has to keep coverage for the first five years. But there's nothing in the legislation that forces companies to keep coverage, although large employers would face a tax penalty if they dropped it altogether. He also says you can't migrate to the public plan. It's true that employers can't force their workers onto the public plan, but individuals can select it if they choose to. The only thing Weiner gets right is that employers can't dump their workers into the public option. Almost all the details are wrong. We rate his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

"Ohio companies," he said, "export more goods and services globally than 41 other states." That aroused the curiosity of PolitiFact Ohio. We wanted to know more, partly because the ranking means Ohio would trail less populous states.

The Development Department is an affiliate of the U.S. Census Bureau. With the U.S. Commerce Department, it is the official source for U.S. export and import statistics. We followed our curiosity further into its data from 2011, the most recent available: In global exports, Ohio trails Texas, California, New York, Washington, Illinois, Florida, Louisiana and Michigan. The state's largest export market is Canada, followed by Mexico, China, France and Brazil. The state's largest merchandise export category is transportation equipment.

On ABC's This Week, for instance, Austan Goolsbee, a member of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, told host Jake Tapper, "Well, the president is totally committed, and it's one of his key principles that we're going to end too-big-to-fail, we're going to end the bailout era that began under the last president, for good.

I have a copy of it here, and it says right at the top of the bill that the purpose is to promote the financial stability of the United States by improving accountability and transparency in the financial system, to end too-big-to-fail, and for other purposes. Sen. Brown, does this bill end too-big-to-fail?" Brown responded, "Yes, it does." A spokeswoman for Brown amplified the senator's comments by telling PolitiFact that "the bill would end the too-big-to-fail policy by setting up a clear process for liquidating large banks that was not available to regulators when faced with the insolvency of" Lehman Brothers, AIG and Citigroup during the financial crisis of 2008. She added that the bill would constrain a Federal Reserve Board authority known as Section 13 (3) that allows the central bank to aid financial services companies "in unusual and exigent circumstances." However, despite some differences in wording, Brown's exchange mirrors a statement we analyzed four days earlier and rated Barely True. In that comment, we looked at what Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said in an April 19, 2010, floor speech -- that the bill "will end taxpayer bailouts." Bailouts have become a special focus of attention because they are especially unpopular among Americans today. Republican pollster Frank Luntz has advised opponents of regulation that "the single best way to kill any legislation is to link it to the Big Bank Bailout." And when lawmakers talk about firms that are "too big to fail," they are referring to the risk that the government -- and therefore the taxpayers -- could be on the hook for bailing them out if things turn bad. We rated Reid's statement Barely True because while the bill's provisions are designed to reduce the likelihood of future bailouts, the bill does not include a provision that actually bars future bailouts. As a result, we concluded that despite taking significant strides to curb future bailouts, Reid's use of the term "end" was too definitive to be accurate. After This Week aired on April 25, we asked several financial services experts whether Brown, like Reid, was too definitive in saying that too-big-to-fail would "end" with enactment of this bill. All agreed that Brown was indeed too definitive. To explain why, we'll recap the relevant provisions of the bill and how outside experts characterize what the bill does -- and does not -- do. The current version of the Senate bill -- which may not be the final version -- would, among other things, create a process for federal authorities to dissolve financial institutions that are teetering on collapse. The bill would set up a panel of three bankruptcy judges to convene and agree within 24 hours whether a large financial company is insolvent. For firms that are "systematically significant" -- a term considered equivalent to "too big to fail" -- the Treasury, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Reserve would have to agree to liquidate the firm, using a special fund created with payments from the largest financial firms. The legislative language is very specific about the money being used to dissolve -- meaning completely shut down -- failing firms. Here's what Sec. 206 of the bill says: "In taking action under this title, the (FDIC) shall determine that such action is necessary for purposes of the financial stability of the United States, and not for the purpose of preserving the covered financial company; ensure that the shareholders of a covered financial company do not receive payment until after all other claims and the Fund are fully paid; ensure that unsecured creditors bear losses in accordance with the priority of claim provisions in section 210; ensure that management responsible for the failed condition of the covered financial company is removed (if such management has not already been removed at the time at which the FDIC is appointed receiver); and not take an equity interest in or become a shareholder of any covered financial company or any covered subsidiary." The bill's language sets a clear intent: Don't keep a hobbled giant going by using taxpayer money; instead, use industry money to close it down in an orderly fashion. Free-market purists may see any intervention of the government into the financial sector as a "bailout." However, we think the more common understanding of the word means that the federal government gives or lends a company taxpayer money to help it stay in business. Merriam-Webster, for example, defines a bailout as "a rescue from financial distress." And in this context, we don't see how the liquidation of a company could constitute a "rescue." But despite the bill's good intentions -- including its efforts to heighten regulation in advance so that problems don't emerge in the first place -- our sources generally agreed that Brown's statement, like Reid's, was too definitive about the bill spelling an "end" to bailouts for "too-big-to-fail" companies. If the danger to the wider economy from a potential collapse is perceived to be big enough some day, the federal government will probably bite the bullet and lend some financial support, our sources agreed. "The bill will reduce the likelihood of future bailouts, as well as reduce the magnitude of any that might nevertheless occur," said Lawrence J. White, an economist at New York University's Stern School of Business. "But 'end' is too strong for what can't be complete certainty under almost any conceivable circumstances." Ronald H. Filler, director of the Center on Financial Services Law at New York Law School, said that he did not see "how the proposed Senate bill completely eliminates the 'too big to fail' theory. If the Treasury secretary wants to bail out a General Motors or an AIG in the future, he should still have the right to act in an emergency state, in my opinion. Whether he will exercise this right, and whether he believes that he needs, and will seek, congressional approval before so acting, is a political question, but not a legal one." "There is no way to know until the next crisis whether a proposal will 'end bailouts' -– it will depend on what policymakers do at the time," agreed Robert Litan, a senior fellow in economics at the liberal Brookings Institution. In the meantime, several sources pointed out that the bill's fund cannot be used to "save" a company or its shareholders, but a firm's creditors appear to remain eligible for payouts. "I realize that there are differing views on the necessity of such authority, and I don't question the sincerity of supporters who see this as the best way to reduce bailouts overall," said James Gattuso, senior research fellow in regulatory policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation. "But I think that it should be acknowledged that the bill does authorize such creditor bailouts, however justified or unlikely one believes them to be." It's worth pointing out that Brown is proposing an amendment that's intended to enhance the bill's ability to curb "too-big-to-fail" firms by limiting the amount of debt they can carry. "Reining in Wall Street's cycle of excessive debt will ensure that no Wall Street bank ever becomes too big or too indebted to fail in a way that wrecks the entire U.S. economy," Brown's office wrote in a news release about his amendments to the bill. He also touted it during the interview with Tapper. But it seems clear to us that Brown's "Yes, it does" comment was not referring to his amendment, but rather to the bill as it is currently written. So we will not factor Brown's proposed amendment into our analysis of his comment. The argument that the bill as currently written will end bailouts and "too big to fail" is certainly one that holds political value for Democrats, and it's fair to say that that's the intention of the legislation. Presumably, that's why Brown, Goolsbee, Reid and other Democrats have continued to make that argument. However, it's an exaggeration to say that the bill would put an "end" to future bailouts. Short of, say, passing a constitutional amendment ruling out bailouts, any future Congress or administration would be able to act as conditions demanded, even after passage of this bill. So we rate Brown's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-06723	People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals estimates 200 animals will be spared annually as the result of former President Bill Clinton adopting a vegan diet.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2011/aug/31/people-ethical-treatment-animals/peta-claims-clinton-saving-200-animals-annually/	Former President Bill Clinton was well known for his appetites while at the White House. The man jogged to McDonald’s for a Big Mac. His ability to pile a plate high with crispy pieces of fried chicken, mounds of barbecued pork and slabs of smoky ribs was legendary. But last year the former chief executive shocked America with a real dietary stunner. Clinton announced he was giving up meat and dairy and undertaking a vegan diet. Following a vegan diet means Clinton will not eat any product that comes from animals. He told reporters that he made the decision after suffering through two major heart procedures.Clinton has undergone bypass surgery and has had stents put in some of his arteries to keep them open. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals responded by naming Clinton its "Man of the Year." It said: "By choosing a plant-based diet, President Clinton has spared the lives of nearly 200 animals a year..." Did they say 200? We understand that beef is what’s for dinner, but 200 sounds like Bill was ravaging pastures of cows, not to mention barnyards of chickens and pigs -- the other white meat. PETA’s estimate is still being disseminated widely -- it appeared just last week in a Los Angeles Times article. A PETA spokeswoman told PolitiFact Georgia the group actually has no way of knowing precisely how much meat Clinton ate or how many animals were slaughtered to satiate his carnivorous cravings. But the organization conducted a study that determined the average meat-eating American is responsible for the deaths of 198 animals annually. It used statistics from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration and other sources to calculate the total number of animals raised in the United States and imported for American consumption. PETA then divided the total number of butchered animals by the U.S. population, minus the estimated number of vegetarians and vegans of course. It didn’t count eggs. But it did count every chicken, cow, pig, fish and duck. But -- and this is where it gets a bit murky -- PETA also counted shrimp, clams, lobsters, oysters, scallops and any other animals that died as part of dairy and meat production. Chris Hurt, a professor of agricultural economics at Purdue University, said this sounds like a reasonable approach and could provide an accurate average. But he still thinks the number is misleading the way PETA used it. The USDA estimates the average American eats about 85 pounds of chicken, 58 pounds of beef, 46 pounds of pork, 16 pounds of turkey, 1 1/2 pounds of veal and 1 pound of lamb each year. Hurt estimated -- and he stressed estimated -- this would equal about 28 chickens, one turkey, and a fraction of a cow, pig, and lamb per person annually. This comes to about 30 animals per year, well short of PETA’s 200 number. Hurt, however, did not include sea creatures in his estimate. The majority of the animals killed would have to be small sea creatures for PETA’s estimate to stand, Hurt said. "Perhaps the misinterpretation is that these are farm animals we’re talking about," he said. "That’s a little misleading." The average American eats 15.8 pounds of fish and shellfish a year, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That includes an average of 4.1 pounds of shrimp per person, 4.6 pounds of fish filets and steaks, and 2.5 pounds of canned tuna. James Dunn, a professor of agricultural economics at Pennsylvania State University, said even counting the small creatures he thinks the PETA number still sounds "way too high." The National Meat Association said the number doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. "They’re only saying that because it sounds good and people can wrap their minds around," said Jeremy Russell, director of communications and government relations for the association. While PETA’s spokeswoman acknowledges its number includes bivalves and other creatures, its number seems to imply a vegan is saving the lives of cute cows, adorable baby chickens and Wilbur-like pigs. Those are, after all, the animals PETA chooses to showcase on its website. PETA’s statement is technically accurate. But it leaves out important details. That’s our definition of Half True.

pomt-02168	Greenlight Pinellas "won’t take existing lanes from other vehicles."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/apr/30/friends-greenlight/greenlight-pinellas-supporters-say-plan-wont-take-/	Details of Pinellas County’s mass transit initiative, Greenlight Pinellas, already have opponents in overdrive. Some critics seem to be especially unhappy after receiving an informational email from Friends of Greenlight, a pro-transit political action committee. The email says the Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority would implement bus rapid transit countywide without altering the current traffic flow. "Bus Rapid Transit will help the Pinellas bus system move faster, but it won’t take existing lanes from other vehicles," the email reads. The email is paired with an artist’s rendering of the 1100 block of 4th Street N in St. Petersburg. The street has been altered to include a bus stop and a new bus lane in front of the block’s businesses. The image, however, shows one other thing -- that the center turn lane 4th Street N has been removed. So how is it that supporters promise the transit overhaul will not result in fewer traffic lanes, while an image shows the opposite? And, more broadly, will Greenlight Pinellas "take existing lanes from other vehicles?" PolitiFact Florida wanted to learn more. What is bus rapid transit? Understanding the concept of bus rapid transit is key to predicting whether Greenlight Pinellas radically alters existing traffic capacity. That’s not as easy as it sounds, because the term bus rapid transit (known as BRT) is a catch-all term that can mean many different things. Annie Weinstock, a director at the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy, helped us with nailing down the details. She said the Institute generally considers the criteria of a BRT system as having: Dedicated bus lanes (ideally in street medians); Intersections that prevent turns across bus lanes; Transit signal priority that detects the presence of buses and changes lights accordingly; Offboard fare collection to reduce wait times as passengers pay at the fare box, the single biggest bottleneck in bus service; Platform-level boarding to help move passengers -- especially handicapped and elderly passengers -- onto the bus as quickly as possible. BRT can have any of these elements in any proportion, as long as the focus is on moving the buses as quickly and as directly as possible. Greenlight Pinellas incorporates many of these changes, but it’s difficult to say which ones, or where they’re going to be. Why? Because of a Catch-22 in the plan. An outline, not a blueprint The current plan is a broad overview of the potential transit expansion, proposing a 1-cent sales tax increase countywide to pay for the light rail line between St. Pete and Clearwater, increasing bus hours, adding routes and building in improvements to allow for BRT. Voters must approve the initiative on Nov. 4. (We checked a previous claim about the sales tax, which you can read here.) Greenlight Pinellas does call for improvements at intersections and bus stops that will allow bus travel to be faster. Some of those changes may include dedicated bus lanes at intersections or bus stops that allow the buses to get ahead or stay out of the traffic. Some routes may simply run at more frequent intervals. PSTA external affairs officer Bob Lasher said the project may also use a method known as "queue jumping," in which buses use separate lights to start travel before regular traffic does. Bus lanes would be built from existing medians and shoulders on most major roads except St. Petersburg’s 1st Avenue N and 1st Avenue S. Those one-way streets, running in opposite directions, are lightly traveled enough to give up an entire lane for bus service without causing traffic problems, PSTA says. Using those two lanes is enough to foster arguments over whether Friends of Greenlight can make such an absolute statement about the plan. What makes it tougher is that so many cooks will be in the kitchen if the proposal is approved. Lasher said PSTA would work with the Florida Department of Transportation, the county and local municipalities to see if other lanes or rights of way could be used for buses. But the details of what those changes would look like isn’t done yet, because the initiative hasn’t been approved by voters. "The actual stop-by-stop, turn-by-turn details won’t be known until after the engineering and environmental studies are done, which would be only if the measure passes due to expense," Lasher said. "If we were to put out that kind of money before hand, and it failed, that would be a big loss and irresponsible of us." Ironically, without those details, opponents continue to pick apart the plan, saying Greenlight Pinellas won’t work because there’s no way to tell how it will be organized. If it’s altering 4th Street in such a misguided way, what else will it do? The problem is, Greenlight Pinellas doesn’t aim to remove the turn lane from 4th Street N. "That photo – which is a mock up – was to demonstrate what a BRT station would look like," Lasher said, pointing out the payment kiosk on the sidewalk at the bus stop. "I use it for that and when I explain off-board fare payment. It was never meant to imply that we would be taking a lane along 4th Street. Our graphics artists used the backdrop, because they liked the background." Friends of Greenlight spokesman Kyle Parks said they would strive to make sure people understood the image was a rendering designed to show what a bus stop would look like and nothing more. So is it possible traffic lanes may be sacrificed, even the turn lane along Fourth Street? Could capital improvements to major roadways really be made without affecting other drivers? Can Greenlight Pinellas really do what it claims it’s going to do? The answer is, sadly, that we can’t say definitively until after the engineers get down to the nitty-gritty details. And that can only happen if the 1-cent tax passes Nov. 4. Our ruling Friends of Greenlight says in its promotional email that implementing bus rapid transit "won’t take existing lanes from other vehicles." Already the statement needs to be qualified, because two thoroughfares in St. Petersburg will be losing lanes if a 1-cent tax increase passes. And while PSTA and Greenlight advocates say bus lanes would be taken from shoulders and medians, there’s really no way to know how roads will be altered. Pinellas residents will have to vote for the proposal in November before a study can be done to work out those details. We can say that there are no plans currently to remove the center turning lane from 4th Street North, and an artist's rendering showing that outcome was actually intended to show what a new bus stop might look like. So there’s no intention to take away traffic lanes beyond the two Greenlight Pinellas mentions, but there’s also no possible way to guarantee it won’t happen. The plan will be implemented with the input of many local municipalities and the state, which means any number of outcomes are possible. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-09923	The war spending bill "actually spends more money on the International Monetary Fund than on the war."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jun/23/lynn-westmoreland/claims-war-spending-bill-does-more-imf-wars/	In an unusual role reversal, most Congressional Republicans recently voted against a war funding bill. Some said they opposed the bill because it had so much money for the International Monetary Fund, a coalition of 185 countries that tries to foster global economic growth. Among the Republicans sounding off was Rep. Lynn Westmoreland of Georgia, who wrote this on his party's blog: "We’re getting an alleged war spending bill that actually spends more money on the International Monetary Fund than on the war," he wrote. "We have the ability to bounce back out of this recession, but we can’t afford to pay for a global bailout – we have more than enough bailouts going on in our own country, thank you very much." All but five of the 178 Republicans in the House voted against the measure on June 16, 2009. The bill is at the White House awaiting President Barack Obama's signature. The IMF's profile has risen in recent months in the wake of the economic crisis, and some financial leaders want the agency to loan more money to jump-start the global economy. We wondered if it was possible that a war funding bill would have more money for the IMF than the wars. Overall, the bill costs about $106 billion, according to the House Appropriations Committee. Approximately $82 billion — or about 77 percent — is for war-related items, everything from new machinery to hospitals. And for the IMF? Zero dollars, according to the Appropriations Committee. So does that mean Westmoreland's claim is false? Not so fast. The bill does establish a $100 billion line of credit for the IMF that the agency could use to make loans to other countries. But the Congressional Budget Office has estimated the actual cost to the Treasury at approximately $5 billion. That sum is largely the product of some confusing budgetary gymnastics based on estimates of how dramatically the IMF would have to use the line of credit and how quickly loans would be repaid, the CBO explained on its Web site. "In forming this estimate, CBO envisioned various potential state of the world economy," wrote CBO director Douglas Elmendorf on May 19, 2009. "In the most likely situations, the IMF would draw against only a small portion of the U.S. commitment and, CBO assumes, the likelihood of those funds being promptly repaid would be high. Thus, the cost of the U.S. commitment would be close to zero in those cases." The CBO said there's a slight chance the IMF would need to loan most or all of the line of credit. In that case, the IMF might not recoup all of the money and the cost to the U.S. Treasury would therefore be higher. CBO noted that no IMF borrower has defaulted on its obligations, but many have had their loans extended or been late on their payments. We spoke with budget experts who said the CBO's estimate is reasonable because it reflects the likely risk to the taxpayers. Loans are a routine part of the annual appropriations process, and they are typically assigned some cost based on risk, said Brian Riedl, a budget expert at the Heritage Foundation. If no money is paid back, "that does potentially make it the most expensive part of the bill. But the odds of it becoming the most expensive part of the bill are slim." The real cost to the Treasury Department all comes down to whether other countries pay back those loans, said Edwin Truman, who is an IMF expert with the Peterson Institute for International Economics, an economic think tank. "Since no country has ever lost money in [IMF's] history, the notion that we will lose $5 billion is a stretch," he said. So as for Westmoreland's claim, he's wrong that the appropriations bill spends more money on the IMF than for the war. Lawmakers aren't literally giving the organization a bundle of cash. But he's right that there's a potential for the U.S. Treasury, over time, to give the IMF quite a chunk of change as a result of the line of credit. However, Westmoreland's claim is based on the premise that countries borrowing from the IMF will never pay those loans back, which is a worst-case scenario that experts say is unlikely to occur. So we rate his claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-03412	Says student loan interest rates will double from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent July 1.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2013/jun/28/gene-green/gene-green-says-student-loan-interest-rates-will-d/	U.S. Rep. Gene Green, D-Houston, recently urged colleagues to move quickly because Congress had "only three days left until student loan interest rates double from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent on July 1st." That statement, from a June 28, 2013, press release, matches recent declarations from other politicians; in fact, we had already started checking a version from President Barack Obama when we received Green’s release by email. Green’s statement further describes the loans as Stafford loans. A spokeswoman for Green, Veronica Custer, emailed us details including a June 18, 2013, report from the Democratic staff of the Joint Economic Committee (Congress’ economic advisory committee) that said, "Unless Congress acts, the interest rate on subsidized federal Stafford loans is set to double from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent on July 1st." Half of the nation’s roughly 21 million college students get some form of federal aid, according to the government’s National Center for Education Statistics. Much of that comes in the form of federal student loans, guaranteed by the government and with low interest rates set by Congress. And about 80 percent of federal student loans are Stafford loans, according to a June 13, 2013, Washington Post news story. Named in memory of a U.S. senator from Vermont who championed education measures, Staffords are either subsidized, meaning the government pays part of the interest, or unsubsidized, meaning the student pays all the interest. Subsidized Stafford loans are available to undergraduates who show financial need; according to the Post story, they make up about a quarter of federal student loans. The unsubsidized variety doesn’t require proof of financial need and is open to graduate students as well as undergrads; about half of all federal student loans are of this type, the Post said. About 7 million students are expected to take out subsidized Stafford loans after June 2013 -- and they’ll get the 6.8 percent rate unless Congress acts as it did at a similar juncture in 2012. Tom Melecki, director of the Office of Financial Services at the University of Texas, described via email the effect of such a rate on a subsidized Stafford loan: "If an undergraduate were to borrow the $23,000 maximum – something which is increasingly common -- he or she would repay $31,761.60 over 10 years at a 6.8 percent interest rate, but $27,163.20 at a 3.4 percent interest rate. So this student would save $4,598.40 in interest payments at the lower rate." The government pays billions to keep its interest rates on federal loans low. According to the Department of Education’s student aid website, rates range from 5 percent to 7.8 percent on non-Stafford types of federal loans taken out from July 1, 2012 to June 30, 2013. Unsubsidized Stafford loans in the same timeframe have an interest rate of 6.8 percent and aren’t scheduled to change, so subsidized Staffords will match the unsubsidized kind if their rate reverts July 1, 2013. In a 2007 overhaul of the federal student loan system, Congress passed a temporary act reducing the rate on new subsidized Stafford loans gradually from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent, set to expire July 1, 2012, according to a Sept. 8, 2007, Los Angeles Times news story and a Sept. 28, 2007, Washington Post news story. But lawmakers swooped in June 29, 2012, to postpone the rate hike until July 1, 2013, at an estimated cost of $6 billion. The revised deadline looms amid competing claims about how the issue might be resolved. A June 26, 2013, New York Times news story said plans had been offered by President Barack Obama as well as Republican, Democratic and bipartisan combinations of Congress members. Green’s press release said he supported a measure that would freeze the 3.4 percent interest rate for two years. But with time running out and no agreement on the horizon, the Times said, it appeared likely that a measure addressing the rate would have to be applied retroactively to loans taken out after July 1. Our ruling Green said "student loan interest rates" would double from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent July 1. That accurately describes one specific rate change. However, the majority of new federal student loans won’t be affected. We rate the statement as Mostly True.	None	Gene Green	None	None	None	2013-06-28T18:53:29	2013-06-28	['None']
pomt-11043	Say "Dunkin' Donuts is providing a free Ḍozen Doughnut Box to everyone! to celebrate 68th Anniversary!"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/jun/29/blog-posting/free-dunkin-donuts-online-offer-scam/	A link circulating on Facebook that offers its visitors a free dozen donuts from Dunkin’ Donuts is a scam. (Sorry if you were hoping for a free sugar rush.) "Dunkin' Donuts is providing a free Ḍozen Doughnut Box to everyone! to celebrate 68th Anniversary!" a website Dunkin USA announces, encouraging its readers to partake in a short survey in exchange for the donuts. We were curious about whether we could truly take this opportunity to get some free donuts from Dunkin’, so we took the survey to see what would happen. The survey asks its participants three questions. The first is whether the participant has ever visited Dunkin’, the second about why the participant prefers Dunkin’, and the third and final question asks whether the survey-taker is satisfied by Dunkin’s services. After we completed the survey, the website asked us to share the page on Facebook, comment "Thanks for my coupon," and click "Like." We followed all these instructions, but were not presented with a coupon for the donuts. The link resembles past offers that have also turned out to be scams. "We only have 332 Boxes remaining so hurry up!" the Dunkin’ offer claims. A previous scam targeting Delta also featured similar language as well as the number 332: "Congratulations! You have been selected to take part in our short survey to get 2 Free Delta Airline Tickets! We only have 332 Tickets remaining so hurry up!" the website Delta-Flying.info stated. In addition, links supposedly offering their visitors coupons for free Dunkin’ Donuts in celebration of the company’s 67th anniversary have surfaced in the past. Snopes debunked a previous version of the scam that was widely circulated in December 2017. Michelle King, a spokeswoman for Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc., told the website Retailmenot.com that the offer is not affiliated with Dunkin’ Donuts. If that isn’t enough, the survey is rife with grammatical and spelling errors. The survey asks, "Have you ever visited at Dunkin’ Donuts?" when it would be grammatically correct to ask "Have you ever visited Dunkin’ Donuts?" In addition, the answer selections available for the survey’s question "You prefer Dunkin’ Donuts because of?" are "It’s Cheapness," "It’s Environment," and "Don’t Know," even though it would be correct to use "Its" rather than "It’s." What’s more, while the survey touts a "free Dozen Doughnut Box," Dunkin’ Donuts doesn’t use that spelling of the sweet treat. It’s unlikely that an official Dunkin’ Donuts offer would contain so many errors. We reached out to Dunkin’ Donuts but did not hear back. A website’s claim that visitors will receive a coupon for a free dozen of donuts in exchange for completing a survey is too good to be true. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!

pomt-05808	"I have a very conservative voting record."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2012/feb/22/connie-mack/connie-mack-says-very-conservative-voting-record/	When U.S. Rep. Connie Mack entered the U.S. Senate race in Florida, he immediately became a frontrunner. But he still has to win the Republican primary, and some conservatives have criticized Mack for not being conservative enough. When asked about that, Mack responded, "I am one of the most conservative members of Congress, and I have a very conservative voting record," according to the Republican blog the Shark Tank on Feb. 4, 2012. In the primary, Mack will face George LeMieux, whom then-Gov. Charlie Crist appointed to serve a vacancy in the U.S. Senate in 2009, and businessman Mike McCalister. The winner will face Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson. Evaluating whether someone is the "most’’ of anything can be tricky. We wanted to see what led Mack to make that declaration and how he fared in various rankings of the 435 members of Congress. Mack campaign spokesman David James sent a list of organizations that had given Mack conservative ratings in recent years. We will summarize many of the ratings that Mack’s campaign sent us, as well as some we found on our own. Mack was first elected to Congress in 2004, so we could have examined his scorecards for multiple years, but we think that looking at his grades for more recent years from multiple groups provides a good snapshot, since he didn’t specify any time frame in his claim. We’ll also look particularly at some of the votes Mack has made that depart from conservative benchmarks. Groups that gave Mack a 100 percent rating Mack received his most conservative ratings from the Christian Coalition of America, Family Research Council and National Right to Life Committee. These ratings were based on 10 or fewer votes, many about abortion and other social issues. Groups the gave Mack less than 100 percent but in the 90 percent range • American Conservative Union (ACU): Mack got a 96 percent from the group that looks at a variety of issues -- in 2010 that included abortion, health care, earmarks and the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul bill. He disagreed with the ACU on one of two dozen votes: he voted against lifting a moratorium on offshore drilling a few months after the BP spill. • Club for Growth: The club ranked Mack 52nd out of 435 with a score of 95 percent. This includes 19 House roll call votes on taxes, regulations and other issues, as well as other actions such as signing the club’s pledge to repeal the federal health care law. Mack lost points for his 2010 votes on oil drilling and supporting the national program for flood insurance. • Americans for Prosperity: The group examines votes based on economic issues. Mack received 94 percent. Rep. Mack voted with AFP’s position on all votes in the first session of the 112th Congress, except for the Cut, Cap and Balance package that AFP supported during the debt ceiling debate last summer. Mack said Cut, Cap and Balance still allowed for an increase in the debt ceiling, which he opposed. Mack also signed AFP’s No Climate Tax pledge. One group gave Mack an A with no numerical rating: National Rifle Association gave Mack an A in 2010 -- a spokeswoman told us the group didn’t give a numerical grade. Analyses from news organizations • The Washington Post did an analysis of members of Congress in 2011 that it dubbed "the apocalypse caucus." The Post noted that this group included lawmakers from both parties "who calculate that the best way to fix government is to act as if you wouldn’t mind if it burned down." The Post pointed to six budget votes between April and October 2011, and Mack was part of the small group that voted "no" every time. • The National Journal ranks members of Congress based on key votes about economic, social and foreign policy issues and then gives them a composite score and ranking. For 2010, Mack did not make the Journal’s Top 10 most conservative. Mack was ranked the 67th most conservative and received a conservative composite score of 82.7 percent. The Journal noted that in 2010, economic issues dominated, and there were few votes on social issues or foreign issues. Votes taken that have angered some conservatives Mack has taken heat from some conservatives for certain votes he took since he was first elected to Congress in 2004. The Shark Tank blog wrote in a Feb. 8 post that he drew backlash from pro-lifers after voting in favor of four embryonic stem cell bills between 2005 and 2007 -- including one to over-ride President George W. Bush’s initial veto. "What can be more pro-life than to help people like my grandfather who suffered from illnesses that stem cell research could help," Mack told the Shark Tank. Conservatives have also taken note of Mack's comments comparing Arizona’s immigration law to Nazi Germany in 2010. Mack was a vocal critic of the Arizona law but now tries to emphasize his opposition to amnesty and calls for tough border control. In late 2011, as he launched his candidacy, he said, "I thought the Arizona law went too far. And in fact the legislature in Arizona agreed and made changes. Now they didn't go far enough for me, but they recognized they were on shaky ground. I think what we need to do is be tough on border security, that we need to have the E-Verify as a national system, that we need to be tough on illegal immigrants but at the same time not destroy the freedoms of some Americans that may look different than you and me." Mack’s Republican opponents have also attacked him for voting for billions of dollars in earmarks -- though members of both parties have pursued earmarks. The Miami Herald reported that many of those earmarks were for defense or popular with constituents such as a local university. But he also voted for projects outside of Florida including an aquarium in Connecticut and a city pool near the California district of his wife, Republican U.S. Rep. Mary Bono Mack. Our ruling Mack said "I have a very conservative voting record." The general way Mack worded his claim makes it easy for him: There are times when he didn’t take a hard-line conservative position, such as his stances on stem cell research and the Arizona immigration law. But Mack’s claim here was about his overall record and how he compared to the rest of Congress, and for that he has gotten high marks from several conservative organizations. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Connie Mack	None	None	None	2012-02-22T09:00:00	2012-02-04	['None']
pomt-03112	In Florida "we have 75,000 on (a) waiting list for child care and 23,000 on waiting lists" for community care for the elderly.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2013/sep/20/nan-rich/nan-rich-florida-waiting-lists-child-care-elderly/	Republican Gov. Rick Scott wants voters to give him ideas about what sort of taxes and fees to cut to save $500 million. Democratic challenger and former state Sen. Nan Rich, D-Weston, says Florida needs to talk about services to fund. "We need to be taking a long hard look at funding the critical needs of the state," she said in a Sept. 11 blog in the Tampa Tribune. "We’re 48th in K-12 funding and 50th in higher education, we have 75,000 on (a) waiting list for child care and 23,000 on waiting lists for CCE (in-home living assistance for the elderly). These are the middle class people we’re talking about." In a related fact-check, we explored how Florida ranks in education funding. Here, we will examine the state’s waiting list for child care and Community Care for the Elderly. Child care waiting list Rich was referring to Florida’s School Readiness Program, which provides subsidized day care for low-income parents so they can work. The program is funded with state and federal money, and families must pay a portion based on their income. To qualify, families must have a gross income no higher than 150 percent of the federal poverty guidelines. The programs are administered by early learning coalitions throughout the state. As of July 2013, the program served 222,817 children. "This is about getting people from welfare to work and educating children and getting them ready for school," said Evelio Torres, president and CEO of the Early Learning Coalition of Miami-Dade/Monroe. In 2011-12, the statewide waiting list hit a monthly average of 74,691 -- just a few spots shy of the number cited by Rich. But it has since declined. In July 2013, there were 60,659 children on the waiting list. A chart of the waiting list over the past decade showed that it had a massive increase in 2008-09, reaching about 58,000. That grew to a peak of about 80,000 in 2009-10. Since then, it has been dropping. We talked to directors of organizations that oversee the child care programs in Broward and Miami-Dade, as well as the director of the state Office of Early Learning, to learn why the waiting list has fluctuated. They attributed it to ups and downs in the economy. All three officials warned there are several caveats about the waiting list. Sometimes a child care provider will send a blast email encouraging parents to sign up, and that can create a spike. Other times, an organization cleans up its waiting list, and the number declines. The list in every community isn’t maintained exactly the same way. And the names on the waiting list aren’t all eligible. "It’s not until we screen and call families that we find out whether they are eligible," Torres said. "A lot of times they are a dollar over income, and they can’t qualify, or not employed by the time you call them, and they don’t qualify. ... Unless you pour hundreds of millions of dollars into the system in Florida, you’re not going to eliminate the waiting list." Barbara Weinstein, president of Family Central in Broward, suspects the need is greater than the waiting list, because some families get scared off by the high numbers on the list and don’t even bother to apply. The state received federal stimulus dollars to help supplement the program during the recession, but that has ended. This year the budget is $567 million, compared to $626 million a decade ago. Community Care for the Elderly Next, we’ll look at whether there are 23,000 on the waiting list for the Community Care for the Elderly program. The state-funded program provides in-home services for frail elders that can include meals, assistance with bathing, light housekeeping and transportation to the doctor. The purpose of the program is to avoid more costly nursing home care. The state’s Department of Elder Affairs sent us a chart showing that Florida’s waiting list hit about 23,000 in June 2011. But it has grown since then, and as of August 2013, the waiting list hit 28,604. The program served 13,790 seniors in 2012-13. Under Scott, funding increased by $1 million in 2012-13 and $3.75 million in 2013-14, said Office of Elder Affairs spokeswoman Ashley Marshall. Rich directed us to the Florida Council on Aging, which supplied us with data from the state showing that some clients enter the system through CCE but are later determined to be eligible for Medicaid or other programs. The Community Care for the Elderly is just one of many programs for seniors that have waiting lists. Our ruling Rich said in Florida "we have 75,000 on (a) waiting list for child care and 23,000 on waiting lists" for Community Care for the Elderly. Rich’s numbers on the waiting lists for child care and Community Care for the Elderly were about a year outdated. Her number overstated the child care waiting list by about 14,000 and understated the community care for the elderly waiting list by about 6,000, based on numbers from this summer. Still, her numbers track with recent averages. Both waiting lists require some further explanation: Everyone on the list may not be eligible for that particular program or could be moved into another program. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-02338	The percentage of black children born without a father in the home has risen from 7 percent in 1964 to 73 percent today, due to changes from President Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/mar/25/facebook-posts/facebook-meme-blames-great-society-large-rise-afri/	A reader recently sent us a bare-knuckled Facebook meme about race and fatherhood. The meme features a photograph of President Lyndon B. Johnson, whose "war on poverty" agenda in the mid 1960s was known as the Great Society. Superimposed on Johnson’s image is the following text: "Black children born without a father in the home rate pre-LBJ's 'Great Society' welfare system in 1964: 7 percent. Black children born without a father in the home rate post-LBJ's 'Great Society' 2014 = 73 percent. Hey, liberals, how's your 'Great Society' working out for the black family?" We wanted to know if the meme’s numbers were right: Did the percentage of black children born without a father in the home rise from 7 percent before the Great Society to 73 percent today, and was it due to Johnson and the Great Society? As we researched this claim, we noticed a problem: There is no federal data on "black children born without a father in the home." Instead, we found two types of data that are similar -- but not a perfect fit. One is unmarried black births as a percentage of all black births. The other is the percentage of black children living without a father in the home. The first option addresses births, a key focus of the Facebook claim. But this figure ignores cases in which a couple isn’t married, but where the father is living in the home. The second option, by contrast, does address living arrangements, but it includes all children up to age 18, not those who were "born" that year. So to be as complete as possible, we’ll analyze both statistics here. Unmarried black births as a percentage of all black births In 1964, according to federal health statistics, 24.6 percent of births to non-whites were considered "illegitimate," the term used for out-of-wedlock births at the time. In 2012, the percentage of black births that were made to unmarried black mothers was 72 percent. This is a large increase, and the more recent figure is more or less on target. However, the starting point in 1964 is higher than the Facebook post suggests. So the overall increase is more limited than the meme says. (Note: The 1964 figure was based on the "non-white" population, a category that includes Hispanics and Asian-Americans, while the 2012 figure was for African Americans only.) So if you use this measurement, the meme’s numbers are off. The percentage of black children living without a father in the home These figures offer even less support for the Facebook claim. According to Census Bureau data, about 20 percent of black children in 1960 were living with just a mother. The comparable figure for 2013 is 50 percent of black children living with a mother only. (The only pre-Great Society year for which data is available is 1960.) So this measurement, too, shows an increase. But the increase is two-and-a-half times bigger, not 10 times bigger, as the meme says, and it’s up by 25 to 30 percentage points, rather than the 66 points cited in the meme. When we checked with experts, we found additional problems of context and logic with the claim. Here are a few of them: Black families weren’t the only group to see an increase in single motherhood over the same time period Rates of fatherlessness for whites have always been lower than for blacks, but fatherlessness among whites still rose between 1960 and 2012. Six percent of white children lived in a single-mother household in 1960, a figure that rose to 18 percent in 2013. That’s a tripling, which was proportionately an even bigger percentage increase than what was observed for black children. We don’t really know how common black single parenthood was prior to the Great Society Douglas J. Besharov, a public policy professor at the University of Maryland, said the official data on black marriage from the early- to mid-20th century is unreliable. It was not uncommon, he said, for black mothers to tell survey-takers that they were separated, when in fact they had never been married, he said. The data for white women is similarly misleading, since many young white women got married as teens and divorced a few years later -- a "shotgun wedding" pattern that doesn’t suggest long-term stability for children. This pattern would mean that the frequency of non-marital births among African-Americans may have been higher than what the early 1960s statistics officially indicated, and the white rate of non-marital births may have been artificially low. "Welfare" -- the implicit target of the meme -- existed well before the Great Society The welfare rules of the 1960s may have imposed a "marriage penalty" on recipients -- benefits that could be earned as a single person would disappear once a recipient got married. But such a pattern should have become evident well before the Great Society. " ‘Welfare’ was part of the New Deal in the 1930s," said Timothy M. Smeeding, director of the Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin. "It was designed for widows with kids who didn’t qualify for Social Security, but it soon became a single-parent program for divorcees and later unmarried mothers." Correlation does not equal causation Just because rates of fatherlessness rose after Johnson and the Great Society doesn’t mean they caused the increase. Lots of other factors were at play. Besharov said the focus on Johnson is off-base. He said that the broader social currents of 1960s "liberalization" -- more permissive sexual mores, easier divorce laws and greater financial independence due to rising rates of female employment, for instance -- did play a role in higher rates of single-motherhood for all races, but "if you define ‘the Great Society’ as the things Johnson did, then there was very little impact" on single motherhood rates. Our ruling A meme circulating on social media said the percentage of black children born without a father in the home has risen from 7 percent in 1964 to 73 percent today, due to changes from President Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society. There’s no federal data to back up the meme’s specific claim, but the most applicable statistics show an increase in black fatherlessness that is more limited, and the rise might have been even more modest still if the early-1960s data had been more reliable. In addition, the focus on Johnson and the Great Society is likely a red herring, since broader, societal factors are believed to have played a major role in rising rates of single-parenthood -- not just among blacks, but also among whites. The exaggerated statistics, combined with an ignorance of important context, leads us to rate the claim False.	None	Facebook posts	None	None	None	2014-03-25T11:49:57	2014-03-25	['Lyndon_B._Johnson']
pomt-00470	Says Leah Vukmir "claimed the open records law didn't apply to her, got sued, lost and cost taxpayers $15,000 in legal fees."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/aug/14/club-growth/did-leah-vukmir-cost-taxpayers-15000-legal-fees-af/	The Club for Growth, a national conservative anti-tax group, released an attack ad against Republican U.S. Senate hopeful state Sen. Leah Vukmir. The video states that Vukmir: "Claimed the open records law didn't apply to her, got sued, lost and cost taxpayers $15,000 in legal fees." Vukmir on Aug. 14, 2018, emerged as the winner in the Republican U.S. Senate primary against Kevin Nicholson and will face Democrat Tammy Baldwin in the November election. There’s no doubt that Vukmir was sued in 2013. But does the ad really capture the whole story? Turns out, much of what the CFG claims in the ad launched in July is easily backed up by evidence in the 2013 case. Vukmir’s 2013 lawsuit The Center for Media and Democracy (CMD) sued Vukmir in 2013 for violating an open records request. At the time, Vukmir was second vice-chairwoman of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). The conservative nonprofit is comprised of state legislators and members of the private sector. The CMD filed a request for records after an ALEC conference in Oklahoma City in May 2013. It resulted in the release of nine documents, but the CMD suspected there were more. The CMD, a progressive watchdog organization based in Madison, was no stranger to requesting records from ALEC. They run a website called ALEC Exposed that targets the organization and its pro-corporation values. And Brendan Fischer, former lawyer for the CMD, said ALEC had been difficult with releasing records in the past. But one of the main reasons the CMD filed the lawsuit was due to a disclaimer that ALEC put at the bottom of their documents. The disclaimer stated: "Because this is an internal ALEC document, ALEC believes that it is not subject to disclosure under any state Freedom of Information or Public Records Act." Fischer said this made it difficult to believe they only had nine documents from the meeting. The assumption proved correct during the settlement when both parties agreed to have Vukmir’s emails searched by an independent party in the presence of a staffer from the center. The independent party found a "significant number" of documents in Vukmir’s email. Later, Vukmir’s team released a statement, blaming the record mishap on technical difficulties. But did she resist by saying that the open records laws did not apply to her? Vukmir filed a motion in Dane County Circuit Court on Sept. 11, 2013, claiming she was immune from lawsuit while she held office. What Vukmir got wrong was that state law only specifies an exemption during the legislative session. She then tried to claim that the session included the entire term of a sitting legislator. The lawsuit, if Vukmir won, would have allowed all lawmakers to ignore the open records law, according to a report published in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. But in the end, the case was settled before trial. Vukmir handed over the missing documents. Her legal team racked up $15,000 in fees, which was paid for by the state. Jess Ward, Vukmir’s campaign manager, did not address the case directly but said it is "nothing more than an attempt by Leah’s opponents to attack her stellar record of saving taxpayers billions." The campaign ad The claim about Vukmir’s lawsuit is the second made in the CFG Action video, after the statement that Vukmir sought leniency for a fellow lawmaker convicted of sexual assault. We rated that claim Mostly True. The group is backing conservatives in seven states during upcoming primaries but have spoken against Vukmir’s campaign. They openly endorsed Nicholson, Vukmir’s challenger in the U.S. senate race against incumbent Baldwin. Our rating The cost of the case may not be the most out-of-the-ordinary part. It is standard practice for a politician to have their legal fees paid for by the state. But in Vukmir’s case, challenging open records laws could have changed the way all legislators respond to records requests. If she had won, legislators would be able to ignore open records law. So, Vukmir did claim the open records laws did not apply to her. She was sued. And she did rack up $15,000 in legal fees. We rate this claim as True.

pomt-11838	"The Legislative Ethics Commission continues to function."	mostly false	/illinois/statements/2017/nov/09/michael-madigan/madigans-ethics-panel-malfunction/	An open letter alleging years of flagrant sexual harassment by members of the Illinois General Assembly toward female lobbyists and others sent lawmakers scrambling to ensure such behavior would not be tolerated going forward. House Speaker Michael Madigan appeared at a House committee hearing to introduce new legislation that adds specific language on sexual harassment to state employee and lobbyist ethics laws. It also sets up required training and reporting procedures on sexual harassment for state elected officials, lobbyists and employees. But another speaker at the same hearing said this action, though laudable, was arriving far too late. In emotional testimony, crime victim advocate Denise Rotheimer delivered detailed allegations of improper behavior toward her by Sen. Ira Silverstein, D-Chicago, as she worked with him to get a bill passed in the legislature. Rotheimer described a circuitous path as she tried to file a complaint about Silverstein’s alleged harassment only to see her case gather dust. Normally, such complaints would go to the Office of Legislative Inspector General, but there has been no legislative inspector general since Dec. 31, 2014. It was the responsibility of the House and Senate to fill the vacancy, but it never got done. Madigan, however, said the lack of an inspector general for just shy of three years was no cause for alarm. "It’s regrettable that we have not had an inspector general, but I think it’s important to know that the Legislative Ethics Commission continues to function," Madigan said. He said the ethics commission’s executive director, Randy Erford, "has provided for the commission to continue to function" and had fielded 26 complaints since 2015. Madigan also said the commission is empowered to appoint a temporary inspector general, but had not done so. This made little sense to us. How could the ethics commission "continue to function" in any meaningful way if there was no one to investigate complaints of ethical violations brought to it? Isn’t the primary purpose of any ethics commission to investigate and mete out discipline for ethics violations? And if it was functioning, why did Rotheimer’s case languish until she went public with her allegations? Quick response We should note up front that no sooner did Madigan conclude his testimony than lawmakers moved swiftly to get an inspector general in place. In a meeting on Saturday, Nov. 4, the eight-member Legislative Ethics Commission voted unanimously to appoint former Assistant U.S. Attorney Julie B. Porter as temporary legislative inspector general through June 30. So Illinois now has someone to receive and investigate ethics complaints against lawmakers. Just three days later, on Nov. 7, the General Assembly passed legislation revising the ethics code that applies to elected officials, state employees and lobbyists to include clear language specifying behavior that qualifies as sexual harassment. It also waived the one-year statute of limitations that would have nullified complaints filed more than a year before Porter’s appointment. A day after Rotheimer’s testimony, Silverstein stepped down from his Majority Caucus Chair leadership post -- which added $20,649 to Silverstein’s annual base pay of $67,836 -- as Cullerton prepared to remove him. But none of this erases the nearly three-year void in which no one was assigned to field and investigate ethics complaints against lawmakers. Standard procedure As described on the Legislative Ethics Commission’s website and in Illinois statutes, the duties of the commission rely heavily on the presence of a Legislative Inspector General. This includes conducting administrative hearings and making rulings "only upon the receipt of pleadings filed by the Legislative Inspector General and not upon its own prerogative… Any other allegations of misconduct received by the Commission from a person other than the Legislative Inspector General shall be referred to the Office of the Legislative Inspector General." Madigan said the commission had continued to receive reports -- 26 of them, though published reports said there were 27 -- even when there was no inspector general. But the law makes clear that those allegations were to be referred to the inspector general. Further, the law says the commission can act on cases only after they have gone through the inspector general. Other duties listed on the commission’s site pertain to administrative functions like publishing manuals and guides, submitting reports, employee training and preparing public information materials on ethics compliance. By law, the commission is required to meet monthly or "as often as necessary." Those would not be impeded by lack of an inspector general. Long-term vacancy The office of Legislative Inspector General had been vacant since Jan 1, 2015. Though Illinois law says the legislative inspector general is to be appointed by "joint resolution of the Senate and the House," lawmakers never filled the vacancy. Republicans had accused Madigan, generally regarded as the most powerful politician in Springfield, if not the entire state, of sandbagging the appointment. Illinois News Network quoted ethics commission member Rep. Chad Hays, R-Catlin, voicing that complaint: On his Facebook page, Hays said he and another ethics commissioner, Rep. Norine Hammond, pressed for the inspector general position to be filled. "My read on the matter is that the Speaker has thwarted efforts to finalize this dynamic," Hays said. "No rationale for foot dragging on this matter is acceptable. The length of time that the position has remained unoccupied is absurd." Madigan spokesman Steve Brown called allegations that Madigan impeded a permanent replacement "baseless." Senate President John Cullerton on Nov. 1 said in a press release that three candidates for the job had turned it down in the past year: "It’s our duty to fill that post. I take responsibility for my role in that lapse, and I apologize for it," Cullerton said. "These corrective actions are a first step in changing an unacceptable culture that has existed for too long." Our ruling Madigan said the Illinois Legislative Ethics Commission continued to function for nearly three years while the Office of Legislative Inspector General was vacant. To the extent that the eight-member commission continued to schedule monthly meetings and saw to internal matters, it did "continue to function." This included its executive director receiving numerous reports of alleged ethics violations. But without an inspector general, it could not function in its capacity to take substantive action on alleged ethics violations. This is why Denise Rotheimer’s complaint saw no action until she went public with her allegations in a House committee hearing. There’s an element of truth in Madigan’s statement but there’s a lot more that’s missing. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-06384	"I made a bunch of these promises during the campaign. ... We've got about 60 percent done in three years."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/01/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-60-percent-his-promises-are-done/	During a fundraising event at a home in Los Angeles on Oct. 25, 2011, President Barack Obama took credit for enacting a majority of his agenda during his nearly three years in office. "We’ve seen change," he told donors. "We know what it looks like. We know what it takes. But we’ve got so much more work to do. And I keep a checklist in my desk, and I kind of see, all right, I made a bunch of these promises during the campaign -- (laughter) -- and let me see, yes, I got that done -- (laughter) -- and that one, yes. No, that one’s not done yet. (Laughter.) So we’ve got about 60 percent done in three years but -- (applause) -- so I’m pretty confident we can get the other 40 percent done in the next five years. (Applause.) But to do that, I’m going to need your help." A few readers wondered what we thought about this figure, since we’ve been using our Obameter to check how well Obama has been keeping 500-plus campaign promises since his inauguration. It is the most comprehensive look at what Obama promised during the campaign. When we asked, the White House confirmed that it has indeed been using our Obameter as its yardstick. "By PolitiFact’s own independent assessment, the president has achieved or made progress on over 60 percent of his agenda," Kate Bedingfield, a White House spokeswoman, told PolitiFact. However, Bedingfield’s standard -- "achieved or made progress" -- is different from what Obama said at the fundraiser, that he’d gotten "about 60 percent done." And that becomes a crucial difference as we rate Obama’s original comment. To explain, let’s first provide some background on our promise meter, the Obameter. The promises we’re tracking were all made during the campaign; they do not include promises made since Obama took office. We rate them as Promise Kept, Compromise, In the Works, Stalled or Promise Broken. One caveat: we're constantly in the process of updating our list of promises, so the numbers change frequently. Given the sheer number of promises Obama made, we haven’t managed to update some in a year or more. The bottom line is that any estimates from our work as it stands today should be made with a grain of salt. That said, here’s the current breakdown of promises on the Obameter: Promise Kept 151, or 30 percent Compromise 46, or 9 percent In the Works 189, or 37 percent Stalled 68, or 13 percent Promise Broken 52, or 10 percent Not Yet Rated 2, or 0.3 percent We think it’s reasonable to give Obama credit for accomplishing the promises rated Promise Kept or Compromise. Together, those account for 39 percent of all promises. At the same time, we think it’s fair to say the president hasn’t accomplished those rated Stalled or Promise Broken. Together, those account for 23 percent of all promises. But to reach 60 percent, the White House needs to include a lot of promises rated In the Works in its count of what's been "done." And that’s a problem. We rate promises In the Works if the administration or its allies in Congress have taken steps to implement the promise but haven’t done enough to move it to either Promise Kept or Promise Broken. Generally speaking, we have had a low threshold for moving promises from Not Yet Rated to In the Works. For instance, if a House Member introduced a bill to enact the promise, we might move it to In the Works -- long before the bill was even considered by the House -- much less passed by Congress and signed by the president. Our threshold for moving a promise to Kept, Broken or Compromise is much more stringent. So Bedingfield is accurate to say that Obama "has achieved or made progress on over 60 percent" of his promises, but Obama himself was wrong to say in his original statement that his agenda is "60 percent done." In the Works, which in some cases may consist only of tiny steps toward accomplishment, is not "done." It’s still theoretically possible that Obama could get to 60 percent. To do so, he’d have to score 108 Promise Kept or Compromise ratings out of the 189 promises currently rated In the Works. That would be 57 percent, a steep but not impossible figure. That also assumes he keeps all of his current Promise Kept ratings -- something that could be at risk from, say, an unfavorable Supreme Court ruling on his health care law. Still, getting the required 57 percent is going to be a huge challenge when facing a Congress where Republicans steadfastly opposed to his agenda control the House of Representative and have displayed great unity in blocking the president. Our ruling Obama’s statement at the fundraiser was clearly in the past tense -- about having already "done" 60 percent of his promises in three years, and a White House spokeswoman made it clear he was relying on numbers from our Obameter. The White House’s subsequent description -- that Obama "has achieved or made progress on over 60 percent of his agenda" -- is essentially accurate based on our data, but that’s not what Obama himself said. By our numbers, the best he can claim for now is 39 percent. So we rate his statement False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2011-11-01T16:26:55	2011-10-25	['None']
pomt-06605	"The federal government has not engaged in (border security) at all."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/23/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-says-federal-government-has-not-eng/	Texas Gov. Rick Perry has railed against the Obama administration for failing to adequately invest in border security in Texas. At the Fox News Google debate in Orlando Sept. 22, 2011, he took it a step further, saying "the federal government has not engaged in (border security) at all." We were under the impression (as is the state of Texas) that the U.S. government is responsible for protecting the nation's borders, so this caught us by surprise. Here's how the debate unfolded: Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace asked former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum whether he thought Perry was soft on illegal immigration. SANTORUM: And so, yes, I would say that (Perry) is soft on illegal immigration. I think the fact that he doesn't want to build a fence -- he gave a speech in 2001 where he talked about, bi-national health insurance between Mexico and Texas. I mean, I don't even think Barack Obama would be for bi-national health insurance. So I think he's very weak on this issue of American sovereignty and protecting our borders and not being a magnet for illegal immigration, yes. WALLACE: Governor Perry, 30 seconds to respond, sir. PERRY: I've got one question for him. Have you ever even been to the border with Mexico? SANTORUM: Yes. PERRY: I'm surprised if you have, but you weren't paying attention, because the idea that you -- SANTORUM: Well, the answer is, yes, I have. PERRY: -- are going to build a wall, a fence for 1,200 miles, and then go 800 miles more to Tijuana, does not make sense. You put the boots on the ground. We know how to make this work. You put the boots on the ground. You put the aviation assets -- SANTORUM: But it's not working, Governor. PERRY: -- in the ground. No, it's not working because the federal government has not -- SANTORUM: But you said we know how it works. Is it working in Texas? PERRY: The federal government has not engaged in this at all. When I'm the president of the United States, I'll promise you one thing -- SANTORUM: But you're saying you put the assets there. Has it worked in Texas? PERRY: -- we will put the assets on the ground -- SANTORUM: You said you have. PERRY: -- the boots on the ground -- BAIER: Senator Santorum, let him finish, please. PERRY: -- the aviation assets on the ground, and we will stop illegal immigration, we will stop the drug cartels, and we will make America secure. SANTORUM: Can you answer the question? Is it working? WALLACE: Well, you know, you asked your question, he gave his answer, sir. SANTORUM: OK. So, according to Perry, the goverment needs to get boots, among other assets, on the ground to stop illegal immigration, stop drug cartels and secure the country. And the reason "it's not working" now is because "the federal government has not engaged in this at all." Really? There aren't any federal boots on the Texas border? PolitiFact looked at related issues this summer, concluding that U.S. Border Patrol has "doubled the number of agents since 2004." Meanwhile, we found it Mostly True that the U.S. has more agents than ever patrolling its borders. Of those more than 20,000 agents in 2010, more than 17,000 worked along the Southwest border, much of which is Texas. No boots, huh? Perry's own office has a Homeland Security Strategic Plan that notes that local and state law enforcement officials "partner with federal agencies like the U.S. Border Patrol" and also notes that part of Texas' $200 million investment since 2005 to fill border security gaps came from federal grants. Meanwhile, at the end of fiscal year 2010, the federal Department of Homeland Security investments in border security had grown to $11.9 billion and included more than 40,000 personnel, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office. We're not checking whether federal investment has been effective — merely, as Perry said, whether the federal government has been "engaged." With more U.S. agents than ever patrolling the U.S. border — most of them in the Southwest — we've got to say, Governor, your own boots might be at risk. Because we rate your statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-12254	Says Paul Ryan said that 22 million Americans "choose to be poor, so it’s their own problem if they can’t afford to be healthy."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/jul/11/newslocom/fake-news-story-twists-paul-ryans-words-poor-peopl/	A story that claimed House Speaker Paul Ryan said millions of people have willingly elected to be impoverished is fake news. A June 28, 2017, post on Politicot.com ran under the headline, "Paul Ryan: ‘22 million Americans choose to be poor, so it’s their own problem if they can’t afford to be healthy’." Facebook users flagged the post as part of the social media site’s efforts to fight fake news. The post started out with real comments Speaker Ryan, R-Wis., made on Fox & Friends on June 27 while discussing the Congressional Budget Office report for the Senate’s health care bill. "What they're basically saying at the Congressional Budget Office is, if you're not going to force people to buy Obamacare, if you’re not going to force people to buy something they don’t want, then they won't buy it," Ryan said. "So it's not that people are getting pushed off a plan. It's that people will choose not to buy something they don't like or want." (We rated that Mostly False, because many of those people will not voluntarily lose coverage.) Then the Politicot.com story said Ryan launched into a tirade to Fox’s Brian Kilmeade about how people should be able to provide for themselves and their families through hard work. That’s where the story turned to fiction. "Being rich or poor is a matter of choice; that’s all there is to it," Ryan is quoted. "So, let me ask you this, Brian: if 22 million people consciously make the choice to not work hard day in and day out, why on earth should the rest of us be concerned with whether or not they’re going to be healthy? If they choose to be poor, then it’s their own problem if they can’t afford to be healthy." Ryan didn’t say that last part, because this story was posted on a parody site that makes up all manner of bogus news stories. We reached out to Ryan’s office but a spokeswoman did not give any comment on the fake quotes. Politicot.com is part of a network of sites related to Newslo.com, which refers to itself in a disclaimer as "the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web." The Politicot.com site is registered to an administrator named Eli Sompo, who runs sites based in Israel and Greece. Sompo has told us he did not write the stories on the websites for which he is responsible, but has several clients. He informed us months ago that he would block any future questions from PolitiFact about the sites. What makes Newslo.com-related stories especially confusing is that they use a small piece of real news or quotes by real people and build fake stories around them. In most cases it is the first paragraph of the story, as happened here. The websites feature a pair of buttons that allow readers to highlight the true parts of their stories, so readers can conceivably know the difference. But it isn’t always obvious that’s the aim, leading the audience to believe the entire story is true — especially when other fake news sites steal the articles and post them without any warning at all. Ryan did discuss how the Senate’s proposed legislation would affect poor people, but he never said 22 million people choose to be poor. We rate this claim Pants On Fire!

pomt-08441	Says "Tom Barrett supports a government takeover of our health care"	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/17/rebecca-kleefisch/republican-rebecca-kleefisch-says-democrat-tom-bar/	Even in the run-up to the Sept. 14, 2010 primary, most voters probably paid little attention to Republican Rebecca Kleefisch or any of the candidates for the get-no-respect position of Wisconsin lieutenant governor. Since her victory, Kleefisch has proven hard to ignore. First, Kleefisch garnered headlines when she revealed she had been diagnosed with colon cancer in the weeks before the primary, had surgery and was declared cancer free. Then, with that in the background, she took center stage in a campaign ad with running mate Scott Walker that assails Democratic gubernatorial nominee Tom Barrett. Little surprise the ad focuses on health care. In the ad, Kleefisch talks directly to the camera: "Thanks to the highest quality health care system in the world," she says, "I won my battle with cancer. I can watch my little girls grow up. Tom Barrett supports a government takeover of our health care. A plan that would increase costs, lower quality and put government in charge of our health care choices. As a mother and a cancer survivor, that’s unacceptable." As Walker enters the shot and nods in agreement, Kleefisch concludes: "Scott and I and our families think you should be in charge of your health care decisions." Strong words. Powerful message. But is it true? The ad drew cheers on the right and howls from the left, in part because while Kleefisch attacks a "government takeover" of health care, her own coverage comes through a state-government plan that covers she and her husband, state Rep. Joel Kleefisch, R-Oconomowoc, and their family. We’ve been here before, when it comes to the charge that the health care reforms -- "ObamaCare" to critics -- amount to a government takeover. But this ad has a bit of a wrinkle, since it also points back to Barrett’s time in Congress and an earlier health-care reform effort. Let’s sort it all out. The Walker campaign starts by pointing to Barrett’s support for the Obama-led reforms. It cites a Aug. 31, 2010 story from the Capital Times that includes this line: "Unlike his opponents, Barrett touts his support of the federal health care reform bill. For those who call for its repeal, he says he has a few questions." The story then quotes Barrett: "Why do you want to take health insurance away from a sick 3-year-old who may now, for the first time, be able to have health insurance? Or why do you want to take health insurance away from a 23-year-old woman who has diabetes but wants to go to college?" The Walker campaign also points to the fact that, as a U.S. House member from Milwaukee in 1993, Barrett was a co-sponsor of Hillary Clinton’s ill-fated health-care proposal. Finally, to support the "government takeover" charge, Walker campaign spokesperson Jill Bader points to a chart from the conservative Heritage Foundation that predicted the percentage of national health care spending under government control would pass 50 percent by 2013. Let’s look at the evidence, piece by piece: The Obama reforms: Leaving aside, for the moment, whether Barrett supports all or some of those reforms, PolitiFact National and its state affiliates have ruled repeatedly on the government takeover charge and found it ridiculously false -- a Pants on Fire. In truth, the health care law creates a market-based system that relies on private health insurance companies. To be sure, government regulation of the existing system increases under the new system. More people will be covered. The government will create exchanges to provide coverage for Americans who have trouble getting it now. Medicaid, the government-run health insurance program for the poor, will be expanded. It is not, as the ad suggests, a single-payer system with government running the sole plan. Indeed, the lightning-rod "public option" -- which would have added a government-run plan to the mix -- was dropped from the bill before it passed. Coverage would be paid for the same way it is now, by private employers and individual premiums. Universal coverage advocates such as Citizen Action of Wisconsin say the national changes mean nearly half a million Wisconsin residents will now have access to private health insurance as Kleefisch and her husband already do. As for the Heritage Foundation chart cited by the Walker campaign, the study notes its projection that government spending on health care will now exceed 50 percent of the market sometime in 2013 is part of a decades-long trend. Indeed, even without the Obama-backed reforms, the government was on track to pay more than half sometime in 2014. The Hillary Clinton plan: Before Obama’s plan, there was the 1993 plan that grew out of Clinton’s work on a health care task force as first lady. Critics shorthanded it "HillaryCare." Two national health care experts -- one deeply involved in work on Clinton’s health care proposal -- told PolitiFact Wisconsin that the Clinton approach was more aggressive and far-reaching than Obama’s plan. A third, Robert Moffit from the conservative Heritage Foundation, judges them equally far-reaching. Clinton’s plan had national spending limits and tried to build a new insurance market with an aggressive regulatory structure, said Judith Feder, a former high-ranking Clinton administration official who is now a professor in Georgetown University’s Public Policy Institute. Both PolitiFact National and the New York Times have described Hillary Clinton’s plan, which was dead on arrival in Congress, as a "radical" proposal. But neither Feder nor Robert Blendon, a Harvard University professor of health policy and political analysis, think "government takeover" fits the Clinton plan -- or the Obama one. Neither do we. Let’s return to the TV ad, which emphasizes Barrett supports such a plan: At a news conference after the ad debuted, Barrett said it is "not true at all" that he supports a government takeover of health care and said he had never supported a single-payer system. Coverage of Barrett’s 1992 congressional bid in the Milwaukee Journal shows that Barrett endorsed universal coverage -- that is, efforts to cover everyone -- but he rejected a government-run system. But to Kleefisch, Barrett’s view that he does not favor a takeover is undermined by his support for the Clinton plan and his views on the Obama-led reforms. In an Oct. 14, 2010 interview with conservative talk radio host Charlie Sykes on WTMJ-AM (620), she put it this way: "He’s a liar." Barrett spokesperson Phil Walzak responded: "Every plan Tom has forwarded has private insurance as the centerpiece. They are trying to generate false fear on this issue." As for the Obama-led reforms now in place, Walker has argued they should be repealed and the state should join a lawsuit against them. Barrett has rejected the idea of joining the suit but has said Wisconsin's next governor needs to find ways to make sure the law is implemented fairly for the state. Where does that leave us? With the emotional emphasis provided by cancer survivor Rebecca Kleefisch, the Republican ticket echoes the GOP attacks used against Democrats across the country and characterizes the Obama-led health care reforms as a "government takeover." But repeating a falsehood -- however often and however loudly -- does not make it true. The Obama reforms would expand the government’s role, but a key principle of the plan is to rely primarily on private health insurance to provide coverage. The government "exchanges" would encourage private insurers to compete for workers from small businesses who currently may not have coverage. As for Barrett, they argue that Barrett backed the whole bill, but provide evidence only that he talked up some aspects of it months after it passed. On the support of Hillary Clinton’s plan in 1993, Barrett was a co-sponsor, and some experts say it went further than Obama’s plan. But it still would have retained a private-insurance based system. It didn’t amount to a takeover either. Can we light two matches? We rate the claim Pants on Fire.	None	Rebecca Kleefisch	None	None	None	2010-10-17T09:00:00	2010-10-13	['Tom_Barrett_(politician)']
pomt-04586	Says the "number-one source" of illegal immigration "is people legally coming to the United States on a tourist visa or a student visa and then disappearing into the population and never being heard from again."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/sep/23/rob-andrews/rep-rob-andrews-claims-most-illegal-immigrants-fir/	Most illegal immigration does not start off with a race across the border, but instead with government visas allowing foreigners to tour the United States or attend school, according to U.S. Rep. Rob Andrews. Once those visas expire, the individuals go from being welcomed visitors to outlaws, vanishing into the population, the Democratic congressman said. Andrews, who represents parts of southern New Jersey, made that point during an interview posted online on Sept. 12 with Townsquare Media New Jersey. Andrews is seeking re-election this November against Republican challenger Gregory Horton. "The number-one source of undocumented people in this country is not people coming across the Mexican border," Andrews said. "It is people legally coming to the United States on a tourist visa or a student visa and then disappearing into the population and never being heard from again." Pinning an exact number on a hidden population remains challenging, but most available estimates suggest Andrews is overstating how many illegal immigrants first arrived legally and stayed past the valid time limits. That "overstay" population typically represents about one-third to roughly half of the country’s illegal immigrants. Therefore, about half to roughly two-thirds of illegal immigrants are generally those who entered the country illegally. In fact, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said in April that people overstaying their visas may account for fewer than 40 percent of illegal immigrants. "That may be a high number, because what we have found is a lot of people who were marked as visa overstays had, in fact, left," according to a transcript of Napolitano’s remarks at a U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. Defending Andrews’ statement, his chief of staff, Fran Tagmire, argued there are more visa overstayers than people who illegally crossed the Mexican border. But we told Tagmire that Andrews’ statement did not directly compare those two groups, but instead claimed overstayers are the "number-one source" of all illegal immigrants. Now, let’s review the estimates we found. A common measure for estimating the overstay population has been analyzing data from the immigration forms visa holders must file when they enter and leave the country. Based on that methodology, in January 2003, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service estimated that out of the 7 million illegal immigrants in January 2000, 33 percent were individuals who stayed after their temporary visas had expired. In a May 2004 report, the U.S. General Accounting Office argued overstayers also include certain groups who had entered the country legally without visas and did not fill out those immigration forms. Using three alternative data sources, the GAO report estimated the overstay population at 31 percent, 27 percent and 57 percent. The most recent estimate we found was released in May 2006 by the Pew Hispanic Center. The center estimated that out of between 11.5 million and 12 million illegal immigrants in 2006, "between 33% and 50% are visa overstayers." That estimate is based in part on the immigration form data used in the January 2003 analysis. Still, data on overstayers has been considered unreliable, in part because of the incomplete collection of those immigration forms when foreign visitors leave the country. The majority of illegal immigrants appears to be due to illegal border crossings, but it’s difficult to reach a precise number, said Edward Alden, an expert in immigration policy for the Council on Foreign Relations. Our ruling In an interview with Townsquare Media New Jersey, Andrews claimed the "number-one source" of illegal immigration "is people legally coming to the United States on a tourist visa or a student visa and then disappearing into the population and never being heard from again." Data on the overstay population has been labeled unreliable, but most available estimates suggest such individuals are not the "number-one source." Those estimates indicate most illegal immigrants had entered the country illegally. Most studies have said overstayers range from about one-third to roughly half of all illegal immigrants, and the U.S. Homeland Security Secretary said people overstaying their visas may account for fewer than 40 percent.

pomt-07990	"Some of the men serving in the (Afghan) armed forces have never driven a vehicle before."	true	/florida/statements/2011/jan/17/marco-rubio/aghan-soliders-first-car-hmmwv-marco-rubio-says/	Florida's U.S. senator, Marco Rubio, joined other senators on a secret visit to Pakistan and Afghanistan over the Martin Luther King Day weekend, where Rubio saw first-hand America's efforts to hand over security and governmental operations to the Afghan people. Rubio and the six other Republican senators did not announce their trip until a conference call with reporters on the morning of Jan. 17, 2011, as the group was preparing to leave. Rubio said that in Pakistan, he met parliament members and U.S. embassy officials. In Afghanistan, Rubio observed Afghan military exercises and met with Gen. David Petraeus and Afghan President Hamid Karzai. Speaking from Kabul, Rubio said 2011 would be a "critical" year for Afghan military forces to "step up," but dismissed plans for the U.S. to begin withdrawing troops this summer. "I think we are on the timeline this year to have some real good news and make some significant progress, but I think if you attach a date to it, that you talk about openly in the press especially, you are really creating a difficult situation," Rubio said. "The bad guys, the Taliban and even al-Qaida, must know all they have to do is wait." Rubio also addressed the challenges in training the Afghan National Army to take over as the primary security force for the country. Currently, there are about 132,000 international troops in Afghanistan, including 90,000 Americans. "Some of the men serving in the (Afghan) armed forces have never driven a vehicle before," he said. "The first time they've ever driven a car or any kind of vehicle is a HMMWV mine-cleaning vehicle." Rubio's statement was meant to broadly illustrate the difficulties in training Afghan men to join a 21st century military force. But we were curious, if on the specifics of the driving claim, Rubio was correct. As part of their mission, American troops are teaching the Afghan National Army and the Afghan National Police weapons and combat training, crisis management and all the other skills modern-day Army and police personnel need. That includes driving the High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWVs) and other military vehicles. We found several accounts of the driver training courses, which last several weeks. Each story helps confirm Rubio's claim. Many Afghani men joining the Army haven't driven before. Here's an excerpt from a story written for the website of the NATO Training Mission in Afghanistan: "For many of the students, it's the first time they've sat behind the wheel of a vehicle, let alone behind that of an up-armored military vehicle. They don't know the driving basics -- braking, seat belt, mirror use or signals -– or the more complicated concepts of manual transmission and engine maintenance." New Afghan drivers have difficulty adjusting to using a rear-view mirror, said Army Sgt. Ernest Richardson, U.S. Army driver course team leader. They also have problems with turn signals. (In Afghanistan, many people use a blinker to indicate it's safe for someone else to pass, rather than an indication of changing lanes or turning.) An Army account of its 60-day course says trainees are taught on three vehicles: a Ford Ranger pick-up truck, an armored HMMWV, and a seven-ton flat-bed truck. "A lot of the students who come to the course have never driven before," said U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Darwynn Palmer. "So teaching them to drive is like teaching a teenager in the U.S. to drive. It's a challenge, but they eventually pick it up." The Army story quoted Mohammed Aghai, an Afghan National Army solider, who was learning to drive for the first time. "I'm here to learn how to be a good driver and so far, I've learned a lot from both the U.S. and the Afghan instructors," he said. "I'm looking forward to completing this class because it will help me, my unit and the ANA." An ABC News story also dealt with the difficulties in something as simple as teaching Afghan soldiers to drive. "About 95 to 98 percent have never driven," U.S. Army Capt. Jon Doiron said. "We are looking at about 90 to 95 percent that are also illiterate in the training as well, so we are having to teach them how to read the different gauges -- everything on the vehicle, as well as any sort of safety warning or anything like that." To confirm the news reports, we reached out to Nazif Shahrani, chair of the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Cultures at Indiana University and an expert on Afghanistan. He said many people in Afghanistan are unlikely to have driven because the country has been consumed by war for much of the last 30 years. "The statement you have quoted from Marco Rubio seems plausible because a great majority of Afghans of military age have grown up during the devastating war years of the last three decades plus, and are unlikely to have driven any vehicles," Shahrani said. Shahrani said the inability to drive would be particularly common in the remote Afghan countryside. Experts and news accounts agree with Rubio. One of the problems facing American soldiers training the new Afghan army is that many members of the new Afghan force don't know how to drive or have never driven. We rate this claim True.

The estimated cost would be $80-billion over four years. The RNC included the proposal in its Spend-O-Meter.

pomt-05715	Says the federal government "tells health insurance companies how much money they're allowed to keep of what they receive in revenues -- 15 percent."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/07/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-government-lets-health-insurers/	In a 40-minute speech to supporters near Knoxville ahead of Super Tuesday, presidential candidate Rick Santorum framed the health care debate in terms of government power versus individual choice. President Barack Obama, he said on Feb. 29, 2012, "wants that power in the hands of government. He wants to control your insurance policies and your access and the reimbursements to doctors and hospitals and how much insurance companies -- not how much they’ll make, how much they’re allowed to keep of the money they collect. "That’s already in place by the way. The federal government has a regulation in place already that tells health insurance companies how much money they’re allowed to keep of what they receive in revenues. Fifteen percent -- that’s what they can keep. That’s how much money they get to keep to run their businesses." He wrapped up the topic saying, "they’re going to micromanage everything because they don’t believe in you." We decided to check the claim that the federal government allows health insurance companies to keep just 15 percent of their revenues to use for operating expenses. Medical loss ratio Santorum didn’t call it by this name, and we didn’t hear back from his campaign for our story, but it appears he was referring to the medical loss ratio, a provision of the 2010 health care reform law signed by Obama and opposed by congressional Republicans. The provision is similar to others already in place in several states. It "requires most insurance companies that cover individuals and small businesses to spend at least 80 percent of premium income on health care claims and quality improvement, leaving the remaining 20 percent for administration, marketing, and profit. The … threshold is higher for large group plans, which must spend at least 85 percent of premium dollars on health care and quality improvement," according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. There are other exceptions for small companies. (You can read Kaiser’s full explainer on the medical loss ratio here.) Insurance companies that exceed those limits are required to pay the money back in rebates to their customers, beginning in 2012. With large group plans required to spend 85 percent of premium income on health care, what’s left is the 15 percent to which Santorum referred. According to John Rother at the National Coalition on Health Care, a coalition of trade associations, labor unions and advocacy groups that supports health care reform, the medical loss ratio "was enacted to put pressure on insurers to become more efficient" as well as to "make sure that consumers and businesses got a fair deal on their premiums." Timothy Jost, a health law expert at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Va., called it "a pro-consumer regulation." The idea behind, he said, is that "when people purchase health insurance, they ought to have the money go to health care." Revenue not affected Santorum referred to health insurers’ overall revenue -- "what they receive" -- but the provision applies only to revenue from premiums. In other words, of what you pay your insurer in premiums, 80 or 85 percent must be spent on your health care. It may not pay for television commercials or new office space. But other sources of revenue may be used for those purposes. "Many (insurance companies) have side businesses, offering IT services and other services that are sold to health providers," said Rother. Added Jost: "Some insurers are heavily invested, and that doesn’t figure in at all." "It’s not that they are limited to 15 percent of their income for all of their expenses. They’re limited in their premium income," Jost said. While they may not account for all revenue, Robert Zirkelbach, press secretary for the industry group America's Health Insurance Plans, pointed out that premiums comprise the majority of insurance companies’ revenue. Expenses not affected Some insurers’ expenses, such as quality improvement efforts, taxes, regulatory fees and patient safety, do not have to come out of the 15 percent. Jost said some things that previously were considered administrative costs are now specifically exempted, namely quality improvement costs that include wellness programs and patient safety. "It does not limit the insurers’ ability to work with doctors and hospitals to improve quality. Those costs are not charged against the 15 or 20 percent limit," Rother said. But Zirkelbach said the cap also encompasses services that affect consumers, including services to help patients navigate complicated delivery systems, efforts to modernize technology and programs to prevent fraud and abuse. His group raised concerns about the medical loss ratio when it was being debated, citing fears it would disrupt the health insurance market and inhibit innovation. A Government Accountability Office study found that the majority of established insurers would have already been in compliance with the medical loss ratio in 2010 if it had been in effect. Thus, most policy holders won’t be getting a rebate this year, Jost said. But they’re also likely avoiding premium rate increases that might have happened without the rule. "It’s … fair to say that many insurers are showing that they can meet this requirement without breaking a sweat," Rother said. Our ruling Santorum said the federal government allows health insurance companies to keep only 15 percent of their revenues to run their businesses. His description of the medical loss ratio provision of the health reform law doesn't tell the whole story. The rule does require large group insurance plans to spend 85 percent of their premium income on real health care. For small group plans the rule is more generous. All health insurance companies are still free to spend other streams of revenue however they wish, and several types of expenses are specifically exempted from the 15 (or 20) percent limit. Santorum’s statement leaves out a good deal of important information. That pushes the needle to Half True.	None	Rick Santorum	None	None	None	2012-03-07T11:11:29	2012-02-29	['None']
pomt-02269	"Drone technology now allows an individual to be recorded in their homes by drones as small as birds and immediately uploaded to the internet."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/apr/09/chris-taylor/bird-sized-drones-could-record-you-inside-your-hom/	On April 1, 2014 state Rep. Chris Taylor warned the citizenry about eyes in the sky and attacks on privacy. "Drone technology now allows an individual to be recorded in their homes by drones as small as birds and immediately uploaded to the internet," the Madison Democrat wrote in a news release. Was Taylor pulling the public’s leg on April Fools’ Day? No, she was dead serious. Taylor spoke the day the state Senate approved and sent to Gov. Scott Walker a bipartisan bill -- cosponsored by Taylor -- to put limits on drone use. The Wisconsin bill, similar to others around the country, attempts to prohibit both law enforcement agencies and private individuals from recording people in locations where they have a reasonable expectation of privacy. Example: inside their homes. Under the legislation, it would be unlawful in a criminal investigation for police -- without first getting a search warrant -- to use drones equipped with video or audio recording equipment to collect evidence in such locations. Emergency exceptions to this prohibition include locating an escaped prisoner, aiding in a search and rescue mission, executing an arrest warrant or preventing imminent harm to a person or the imminent destruction of evidence. The bill allows hobbyists, entrepreneurs or aerial photographers to use drones as long as that use does not intentionally violate an individual’s privacy interests. Gov. Scott Walker signed it into law on April 8, 2014. Taylor, in her statement, focuses on the state of the technology, not on who is doing the recording. Let’s see if she’s correct. Some basics first. Drones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are small aircraft that can fly by remote control without an onboard human operator. They can be part of a system that includes a digital network and personnel on the ground, and can be equipped with high-powered cameras, with infrared devices that sense objects through walls, and with laser radar that can see through trees and foliage, the Congressional Research Service said in a 2013 report. Their use by law enforcement and the military in the U.S. "raises far-reaching issues concerning the extent of government surveillance authority, the value of privacy in the digital age, and the role of Congress in reconciling these issues," the report noted. To address Taylor’s specific statement, we turned to government studies, technology and privacy experts, law enforcement officials and drone manufacturers. The bottom line: A wide range of experts said Taylor’s scenario reflects the capability of current technology. Size Drones can be as small as insects and as large as regular aircraft. Models used by law enforcement have included the Draganflyer X4-ES, which is just 24 inches wide, and the AeroVironment Wasp, described as "bird-size" in a Washington Post story about Texas police conducting discreet video surveillance before a SWAT team stormed a property that officials believed had a cache of weapons. A tiny drone developed for the U.S. military weighs less than a AA battery and resembles a live hummingbird that can hover, climb, fly through an open doorway and relay real-time video back to its operator, according to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. That drone, AeroVironment’s Nano Hummingbird, could someday provide new reconnaissance and surveillance capabilities in urban environments, the AeroVironment website says. Someday, because it’s not in production yet. Army-technology.com said in 2012 that UAVs "are getting smaller and more agile to enable combatants to gather intelligence from hard to reach areas, such as in buildings and through tunnels." Internet A Draganflyer official told us it’s easy to upload the live video images that a remote operator is viewing. It just takes some additional equipment. "That’s a minor thing as far as I’m concerned," said Kevin Lauscher, a former police officer who is now sales manager and flight trainer at Draganfly Innovations. "The realistic expectation of privacy is pretty weak in these days of technology" and people recording conversations and posting photos with their phones, he said. Recording people in their homes Taylor aide Craig Trost told us the representative meant recording through a window, not with see-through-walls camera technology that is still under development. Taking pictures of people inside their home is possible with a drone, various law enforcement officials told us. Image quality would be a major challenge though. Daniel Schwarzbach, a pilot for the Houston Police and executive director of the Airborne Law Enforcement Association, said police could film people through their windows after getting a search warrant but he doesn’t recall that happening or police being interested in it. So, Taylor’s description of drone capabilities is not imaginary. How likely it is to happen? That’s an important question, and we got an earful on it, though we don’t think the answer bears directly on the accuracy of her warning about what is possible with current technology. "Doing what she is afraid of would be difficult at best, it would be illegal under peeping Tom laws, and it’s not on the agenda of law enforcement," said Gregory McNeal, a national security and criminal law expert at Pepperdine University law school. McNeal added: "If she is worried about invasions of privacy, she should update Wisconsin’s invasion of privacy laws for all forms of observation, not just drones because what she’s alleging can be done by a drone can be done with an iPhone, any camera, or binoculars." The privacy issue is not about unmanned aircraft, it is about image capture and retention, in the view of Alan Frazier, a University of North Dakota aviation professor and former Grand Forks County sheriff’s deputy. "Agencies need to have a robust policy in place regarding appropriate uses of all types of image capture devices," he said. Taylor, a lawyer, says it’s not at all clear that current law criminalizes peeping remotely using a drone. Law enforcement officials using drones told us a rogue user might try to do that, but not them. "We cannot look into homes, our systems are twice the size of a goose and we don't operate in areas where we have internet, nor do we have, or need, the desire to upload anything to the internet …" said Ben Miller, director of the Mesa County, Colorado, unmanned aircraft systems program. "We mostly take aerial pictures of crime scenes and conduct aerial search and rescue flights." Taylor, for the record, says she wasn’t suggesting that law enforcement was illegally peeking into windows, just the possible uses of the technology. Allie Bohm, advocacy and policy strategist at the American Civil Liberties Union, said a hobbyist could buy a drone size of a large bird and put a camera on it and get video and put it on the Internet. But Bohm called that a "side issue" because there’s no evidence drones are being widely employed in that fashion, in part due to Federal Aviation Administration rules, Bohm said. Public entities seeking to fly drones must get FAA approval. More than 1,800 have done so since 2007, including law enforcement, firefighting, border patrol, disaster relief, search and rescue, military training, and other government operational missions, the FAA says. (The Milwaukee Police Department does not own or use drones, spokesman Mark Stanmeyer told us.) Under current FAA rules, a drone must be flown within the line of sight of the operator, less than 400 feet above the ground, during daylight conditions, inside uncontrolled airspace and more than five miles from any airport or other location with aviation activities. "Flying model aircraft solely for hobby or recreational reasons does not require FAA approval, but hobbyists must operate according to the agency's model aircraft guidance," FAA spokesman Les Dorr said in a statement. Commercial operations are only authorized on a case-by-case basis and to date, only one has met these criteria, using Insitu's ScanEagle. A commercial flight requires a certified aircraft, a licensed pilot and operating approval. That authorization was limited to the Arctic. Our rating Taylor said that "drone technology now allows an individual to be recorded in their homes by drones as small as birds and immediately uploaded to the internet." There are legal and operational obstacles to making this scenario a reality, we learned. But Taylor’s carefully worded statement was about the state of the technology, and her scenario is technically possible right now. We rate her statement True.

pomt-07494	Says Gov. Rick Scott lost Florida 331,247 jobs.	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2011/apr/12/pink-slip-rick/pink-slip-rick-group-says-jobs-governor-lost-33124/	As the grand marshal of a Tallahassee parade, Florida Gov. Rick Scott smiled and waved to crowds lined up along the route for "Springtime Tallahassee," an annual Capital City celebration on April 2, 2011. Some people in the crowd, though, weren’t exactly waving back -- at least, not with their hands. Hundreds wielded "Pink Slip Rick" picket signs and booed. Their posters were hard to ignore, and not just for an eye-catching splash of hot pink. The signs accuse Scott of losing 331,247 jobs. This number stirred our curiosity for a few reasons. One, it's oddly precise. Also, it’s huge! How could Scott, the self-proclaimed "Jobs Governor" who swore to bring 700,000 jobs to the Sunshine State in seven years, eliminate hundreds of thousands of positions so quickly? We thought we'd begin by checking Florida's most recent unemployment statistics. The state's unemployment rate fell by 0.4 percent from January 2011, when Scott was inaugurated, to February 2011, hitting 11.5 percent. Interestingly, the number of non-agricultural jobs increased by 22,700 in that span. We took a closer look. The Pink Slip Rick campaign is sponsored by Florida Watch Action, an upstart progressive group that also had a hand in the Dirty Hari website targeting Mike Haridopolos, Florida Senate president and U.S. Senate candidate. The executive director of Florida Watch Action is Susannah Randolph, wife to Rep. Scott Randolph, D-Orlando, and former campaign manager to former U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson. (Remember the "Taliban Dan" ad?) PinkSlipRick.com offers a "Get The Facts" page, breaking down how it reaches 331,247 lost jobs, with linked sources copied here: • 135,000 jobs from moving Medicaid to a state-run program • 113,065 construction jobs from Scott stalling SunRail contract • 1,849 in layoffs from Department of Children and Families, as outlined in Scott’s proposed budget • 20,000 teacher layoffs, per Scott’s budget proposal • 49,900 job losses for rejecting high-speed rail • 1,690 jobs cut from state prison system We have an immediate problem, as those figures fall short of Pink Slip Rick's count by about 9,700 jobs. Randolph sent us a spreadsheet accounting for more "lost jobs," and we’ll get into those in a second. Medicaid: Scott wants to turn over more control of the state-administered Medicaid system to managed-care companies, namely HMOs, to save state money. But the federal government, which pays for more than half of the program, needs to sign off on major changes such as these, and getting a waiver isn't so easy. The Florida Senate has proposed withdrawing from the Medicaid program if the federal government doesn't approve of its new bill to expand managed care. The House, which also wants more HMO involvement, has made no such proposal to withdraw from federal oversight of Medicaid. The governor's team has discussed the merits of withdrawing, but the governor has made no such proposal and hasn't spoken in favor of it. His health and human services transition team recommended expanding a current Medicaid waiver for a small pilot program to statewide, but Scott said at the National Governors Association meeting in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 27 that he would prefer a block grant of federal money for Medicaid. "You give me a block grant, let me do whatever I want, and I will cover the right people," he said. Pink Slip Rick attributes the loss of 135,000 jobs to a January 2011 report from the Florida Center for Economic and Fiscal Policy, a Tallahassee think-tank focused on low- and moderate-income families and small businesses. According to the report, the state would lose $11.7 billion in federal matching funds and 135,000 jobs representing $5.6 billion in wages next year if it received a complete federal waiver (which is not what Scott proposed). The exact number of eliminated jobs -- doctors, nurses, pharmacists, etc. -- would depend on several political variables and business-related decisions, said the report's author, the center's House policy analyst Greg Mellowe. He's also the policy director of Florida CHAIN, a liberal health advocacy group. The prospects of receiving a federal waiver this year are next to impossible, he said, as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services won't make a decision on a waiver until June. That's too late for the legislative session, which ends May 6. Given the improbability of obtaining a waiver for expansion, and that Mellowe's estimate of lost jobs would only happen with a total federal waiver (which isn't on the table), Mellowe said it isn't fair to include his estimate of 135,000 into Pink Slip Rick's tally. "No one thinks this is really a reality-based scenario," Mellowe said. SunRail: Scott froze this contract as part of his review of hundreds of contracts exceeding $1 million since his inauguration. Pink Slip Rick cites a one-page summary report from the City of Orlando, which says creation of the Orlando commuter train will bring 113,065 construction jobs for transit-oriented development. We traced that figure to an executive summary of the SunRail project by the Florida Department of Transportation. The report elaborates on that estimate of construction jobs, which would be created within a half-mile of the commuter train line over 20 years. Development doesn't happen overnight. The estimate by Pink Slip Rick seems arbitrary, as it doesn't differentiate among direct construction jobs for the train, train operations and maintenance jobs, and indirect and direct jobs created as a result of development over time. Either way, the number of "jobs lost" here is unclear because the fate of SunRail is under review. Still, Pink Slip Rick counts them as lost jobs. Teachers and high-speed rail: PolitiFact Florida has been down these two roads before, and Pink Slip Rick.com even links to our Truth-O-Meter rulings to corroborate its count. But we find that misleading. Our stories on teacher layoffs and high-speed rail do not endorse these figures. We gave Florida Democratic Party chairman Rod Smith a Half True when he said Scott’s budget would lay off 20,000 teachers. One of the problems we found is that Scott's budget proposal cuts education by an amount that equals 20,000 teacher salaries -- but it doesn't specifically eliminate teacher positions. That would be up to local school districts how they handle the cuts. We also cited the constitutional classroom-size requirement as a factor that could force districts to avoid widespread layoffs, and the fact that districts will see some cost savings from teachers contributing a percentage of their salaries to their pensions. We also checked exaggerated job projections by U.S. Rep. Corrine Brown in the $2.4 billion high-speed rail money that Scott rejected. We found that the Florida Department of Transportation estimated that the project would have created 49,900 "job-years" in Florida, but a job-year is not the same as a job. Basically, it refers to the number of jobs that will be funded each year. The proposed line connecting Tampa and Orlando would have created construction and construction-spinoff jobs for parts of four years, peaking at a total of 21,600 jobs in the second year of construction. Randolph's site mislabels job-years as jobs, an important distinction. DCF and prisons: Pink Slip Rick got the number of proposed layoffs in the departments of Corrections and Children and Families right, but that doesn't mean those jobs should count as eliminated positions. Scott's budget is really a recommendation for the Legislature, which members can use, adjust or ignore as they craft the state's actual budget. Here's why the Pink Slip Rick figures don't add up on the web: In addition to the cuts in prisons and DCF staff, the web site counts all of Scott's proposed cuts to state government workers for the next two years. That's a total of 13,282 jobs, and it's not clear those are included because they aren't listed in the breakdown of jobs on the site. But those jobs also aren't "lost" either; they are in Scott's proposed budget, but that's not a fact yet. So just because we can see how Randolph got her grand total doesn't mean it reflects an accurate number of lost jobs. Randolph, reached by phone, says she isn’t just counting jobs already cut by Scott, as the signs claim, but jobs lost or stalled by his refusal of federal money and review of contracts, she said. "From where we sit, he’s turning jobs away," Randolph said. "This is specifically to call him out on ‘what jobs are you creating?' " But that’s not what Pink Slip Rick advertised on picket signs and online. The signs read "Jobs Lost Under Pink Slip Rick -- 331,247." We find this tally deceptive for its mixture of proposed layoffs and job projections. The Medicaid jobs total is based on a change that Scott isn't proposing. The SunRail jobs are still up in the air, awaiting a decision from Scott. Teachers may well be affected by the budget, but we've already ruled that 20,000 is not likely. Prison and DCF jobs depend on what the Legislature does, and that's still an unknown. As for high-speed rail, yes, we've ruled that those jobs won't be coming -- but there were only 21,600 of them at the peak of construction. So Pink Slip Rick has pulled together a bunch of numbers but is misrepresenting what they mean. You can't just lump the governor's cost-saving proposals, which need legislative approval and will undergo tinkering by lawmakers, and vague estimates stemming from rumored policy decisions into one sum and label it "Jobs Lost."

pomt-07863	"In Mexico, they don't have birth certificates... they don’t have registration cards for voters. They have one national ID."	false	/texas/statements/2011/feb/09/pete-gallego/rep-pete-gallego-says-mexicans-have-one-national-i/	State Rep. Leo Berman, R-Tyler, who favors a GOP-backed mandate that voters show their photo ID at the polls, recently pointed to another voter ID — in Mexico. "If you don’t have this card in Mexico, you don’t vote," he said on the Jan. 27 edition of Your News Now’s Capital Tonight, holding a voter card from Mexico’s Federal Electoral Institute that he described as including a photo, fingerprint and "your life’s history." In a separate interview for that night’s program, which airs weekly in Austin, Waco and other cities, state Rep. Pete Gallego, D-Alpine, who opposes voter ID legislation, said: "You’ve got to tell the whole story. In Mexico, they don’t have birth certificates, for example. They don’t have a lot of the same things that we have. They don’t have registration cards for voters. They have one national ID. We don’t have a national ID." Shifting away from the hubbub about the proposed voter ID law, we wondered whether Mexicans have one national ID, but lack birth certificates and voter cards. In an interview, Gallego told us that "most of (Mexico’s) population" doesn’t have a birth certificate. "Mexico is not at a point where they have implemented the law all across the country," he said. "They don’t have the resources." Gallego said that supporters of a voter ID in Texas are pointing to Mexico as an example of the law at work, but "Mexicans have a national ID card for everything," not just voting. "It’s just a different system," he said. When we asked if anyone could confirm his statements, he arranged a conference call with Rosalba Ojeda, the consul general of Mexico in Austin. Ojeda told us that birth certificates have "been around forever" in Mexico, but some residents in remote areas "simply don’t get around to registering the baby." Some people aren’t registered until they’re older, "when they have the opportunity to go to the village," she said. Mexicans can register their birth at any time, Ojeda said, but it’s not necessarily easy. They must go to the local municipio, or municipal office, of their birthplace and bring witnesses who can attest to their birth in Mexico. She said that she doesn’t know what proportion of the population has a birth certificate but that the government has conducted "a lot of campaigns" in the "last 15 years and so most of the people I would say now would have one." Birth certificates are required to access hospital services and get a passport, Ojeda said. Ojeda also told us that the Mexican government is conducting a pilot project that gives citizens national IDs. According to a Jan. 25 San Diego Union-Tribune news article, Tijuana elementary school students became the first to register for the new identity card. "The card is aimed at minors from ages 4 to 17, but by the end of 2012, Mexico’s federal government is hoping that as many as 25.7 million children will sign up," eventually extending ID cards to adults as well, according to the article. "With the document, they won’t need to present a birth certificate when registering for school, medical appointments or to receive other public services." The article also says that in Mexico, "birth certificates and voter registration cards are the most commonly used identification documents." Ojeda told us that a birth certificate is also required to get an electoral ID, which citizens need to vote. According to the electoral institute’s website, to vote, Mexicans must apply to the "Electoral Roll" by personally submitting an official form that includes their signature, fingerprint and photograph to a field office of the Federal Electoral Registry. There’s an office in every electoral district. There are some exceptions, such as for citizens who physically can’t go to the offices. Since 1991, the institute has issued free "photo-voting cards" — "an essential document to exercise the right to vote," according to the site. They include the owner’s address, electoral district, full name, age and ID number. Kenneth Greene, an associate professor of government at the University of Texas at Austin, told us that Mexico does have birth certificates. He said that he hasn’t seen a national ID, but that the country does have a voter ID card. Andrew Selee, director of the Mexico Institute at the Washington-based Woodrow Wilson Center, told us in an e-mail that Gallego’s statement is incorrect on both counts. Selee said Mexico has birth certificates and registration cards for voters, but the country doesn’t have a national ID card. "Their voter registration card usually serves that purpose," he said. "There is discussion of creating a national ID, but it doesn’t exist yet." While some people in rural areas don’t get birth certificates, Selee said, "that doesn’t seem to be a major problem anymore in Mexico in the way it is in some countries like Haiti and Bolivia." Separately, Greene pointed us to an undated report by the Mexico-based Be Foundation, which works to increase birth registration in the country. The report says Mexico "has no simple system for registering births. For poor people in rural areas, getting a birth certificate can mean walking hours or even days to the nearest municipal office." Karen Mercado, the foundation’s president, told us in an e-mail that "in Mexico, more than 10 million people lack a birth certificate," which she said means "no access to (citizens’) most fundamental human rights to education and health programs, protection and participation." In a follow-up interview, Gallego told us: "My issue is not that they do not have birth certificates — it’s that they’re not credible... it’s not that the system doesn’t exist. In practical terms, a lot of people don’t have them, and they’re not necessarily reliable." He told us that he was referring to the voter ID when he said Mexico has one national ID. To the Truth-O-Meter. As experts pointed out, the statement misfires on three fronts. Mexicans don’t have a "national ID card for everything," though a pilot project is under way to issue identity cards to minors. But the federal government issues voter IDs featuring each voter’s photo and other personal information. The government also issues birth certificates; according to experts we spoke with, less than 10 percent of residents don’t have one. We rate Gallego’s statement as False.

Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., on a criminal investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton went missing and were later found dead. "Trey Gowdy breaks his silence after 2 of his investigators are found tortured and killed," read the headline on the blog WhatHappensintheUSA.com. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. The article falsely claims that two officials were reportedly on their way to deliver a search warrant on the Clinton Presidential Library when they were tortured and killed, with no evidence left behind. If such a crime were true, it would be picked up by legitimate journalists. But there is no evidence of anything like that happening in Little Rock, Ark., where the presidential library dedicated to former president Bill Clinton is located. Gowdy, who previously announced his plan to retire earlier this year, was the former chairman of the House select committee investigating the 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic properties in Benghazi, Libya, and Hillary Clinton’s response to the attacks as secretary of state. The final Benghazi report was issued in 2016, and found no personal culpability on Clinton’s behalf. The fake news article also said that Gowdy had no comment about the made-up incident for safety reasons. The story also reported a phony statement by Gowdy about a "vast conspiracy." When searching these statements, we found no credible reports that Gowdy has made any similar claims. We ran this conspiracy by Gowdy's office, and they confirmed it was inaccurate.

pomt-08937	Because of union rules, cooks helpers moved into DMV jobs they were not trained for	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2010/jul/25/john-robitaille/robitaille-says-union-rules-allowed-cooks-helpers-/	No Rhode Island state agency is more reviled than the Division of Motor Vehicles. And let's face it, with waits that have stretched to seven hours, branch closures and antiquated computing systems, there's not much to like. Seems like we've heard all the complaints. But Republican candidate for governor John Robitaille, speaking on WPRI Channel 12's weekly Newsmakers show earlier this month, offered a new one. Former attorney general Arlene Violet, one of the panelists, asked Robitaille about the Carcieri administration's role in the problems at the DMV. (Before launching his own bid for governor, Robitaille had served as Carcieri's communications director.) In recalling his frustrations with the registry, Robitaille told the Newsmakers panel: "We had cook's helpers that, because of their union status and seniority in other parts of state government, had the right to move into the DMV, not trained for the jobs." It was not surprising to hear Robitaille make this sort of claim. The Carcieri administration has long maintained that union personnel rules have hampered its ability to rejigger state agencies and realign staff. But when we asked Robitaille to back it up, he didn't offer much help. Citing what he said was data from the state's Department of Administration, he told us there was one former cook's helper now working as a DMV customer service representative. He then insisted there are many more former cook's helpers working within the registry. But he said the Human Resources department couldn't confirm that without a time-consuming manual search and he refused to request such a search or provide additional proof. "They have more important things to do. I stand by the information I was given by former members of the administration that there were in fact several employees who bumped into the DMV from cook's helpers positions in the recent past," he wrote in an email. The problem is, he refused to provide us with any evidence. So we filed our own public records request. The data we received revealed that there are three former cook's helpers currently working at the DMV. Despite what Robitaille said, none is a customer service representative. The list shows that one is a senior clerk and one a Spanish interpreter, both of whom previously worked as cook's helpers at Rhode Island College. The third, a senior teller, worked as a cook's helper at what is now known as the Department of Behavioral Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities and Hospitals. There was some truth to the first part of Robitaille's statement. But what about the second part, that the transfers of cook's helpers to the DMV were connected to their "union status or seniority" and that they arrived at the DMV "not trained for the jobs." According to Melanie Marcaccio, deputy personnel administrator for the Department of Administration, applicants for these jobs would have to meet education and experience requirements, regardless of their union status. The official job descriptions all require a high school degree and related experience. For the senior clerk, that means clerical experience. For the senior teller it's supervisory experience, with involvement in payment and accounting practices. And for the interpreter it means "the ability to speak, read and write Spanish." For most job classifications, a civil service examination is also required. Candidates who score high enough are placed on a list to be given preference if a job opens up. Maureen Tripp, president of the union representing DMV workers, defended her members' training. "They had to take the civil service test, receive a score, had a ranking and were interviewed," she said. "They were deemed qualified at the time they applied." But there's a complication. The state only administers these tests periodically, if at all, depending on job classification, according to Marcaccio. Those who have not yet taken the test are therefore considered temporary, pending their scores on the exam. When and if the test is eventually given, they must do well enough, or risk losing their jobs. The three former cook's helpers now at the DMV have not taken the test, she said. However that doesn't automatically make them unqualified. They'd still have to have the necessary education and experience. It's that background that deems them qualified for appointment to the job, regardless of their union seniority, Marcaccio confirmed. Once it is determined who meets the specifications, preference is given to those with the most seniority. While Robitaille's statement that there are a handful of former cook's helpers among the almost 150 DMV employees is correct, he couldn't support his claim that they weren't qualified. We all know the registry needs an overhaul, but it's important to focus on the facts. We rate this Half True.	None	John Robitaille	None	None	None	2010-07-25T00:01:00	2010-07-11	['None']

It’s called the Congressional Progressive Caucus."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2012/apr/11/allen-west/allen-west-says-about-80-house-democrats-are-membe/	Speaking at a town hall meeting, Republican Allen West made the startling claim that many of his fellow members of the U.S. House of Representatives are members of the Communist Party. The TCPalm, a newspaper that covers northern Palm Beach County and the Treasure Coast, reported on comments the South Florida congressman made at a town hall in Jensen Beach on April 10, 2012. The article reported that West claimed up to 80 House Democrats are Communist Party members, though he didn’t name names. West’s words went viral. Some of the responses were funny: A commenter on the the Palm Beach Post website pretended to be Joe McCarthy, the red-baiting senator from Wisconsin: "I told you there were 80 communists in Congress!" By the next day, West’s Democratic opponent, Patrick Murphy, had posted a 26-second video of West’s statement. West’s campaign then distributed their own slightly longer version of the video. The audio is somewhat difficult to discern in parts, but here’s a transcript of what we heard: Moderator: "What percentage of the American legislature do you think are card-carrying Marxists or International Socialist?" West: "It's a good question. I believe there's about 78 to 81 members of the Democrat Party who are members of the Communist Party. ... It’s called the Congressional Progressive Caucus." So how many -- if any -- Democrats in Congress are communists? West points to the Progressive Caucus We asked West’s spokeswoman Angela Melvin for an explanation: "The congressman was referring to the 76 members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. The Communist Party has publicly referred to the Progressive Caucus as its allies. The Progressive Caucus speaks for itself. These individuals certainly aren't proponents of free markets or individual economic freedom." On Facebook, West elaborated: "I stand by the point of my comments. The press wants to write gotcha stories and talk semantics, but just look at the words and actions of the Progressive Caucus. You can call them socialist, Marxist, communist or whatever you want, but the point is, they oppose free markets and individual economic freedom, they want to redistribute wealth, and they want to see the nation fundamentally transformed. Their policies are destructive and I will stand up to them regardless of the critics. Members of this Caucus lavished praise on Fidel Castro following a 2009 visit, just to name one example. The Communist Party USA claims the Progressive Caucus as its ‘ally.’" West’s campaign manager Tim Edson told the Washington Post that some Democratic members have traveled to communist Cuba or praised Fidel Castro. (The Post noted that some Republicans have gone to Cuba too.) From the Post: "Pressed on whether those members are actual communists, Edson said the label isn’t the point. "We can quibble about the terminology used to describe them, but it’s clear. Whatever you call people that oppose capitalism and free markets and individual economic freedom — maybe it’s ‘socialist,’ maybe it’s ’communist’ — but that’s the point the congressman was making, and he stands by the words." It might surprise you to know that PolitiFact has already checked claims about how many members of Congress are socialists. In the past, though, it’s been a claim confined to bloggers. (See these fact-checks from PolitiFact state sites in New Jersey, Texas and Oregon.) Here in Florida, we previously ruled on a claim from bloggers that three Florida Democratic members of Congress are socialists; we rated that Pants on Fire. Corrine Brown, Alcee Hastings and Frederica Wilson are members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus -- the largest caucus within the House Democratic caucus. Founded in 1991, the group of lawmakers supports policies that advance economic justice, civil rights and other causes. The Progressive Caucus is co-chaired by U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota. We asked Ellison’s spokeswoman Jennifer Gore if any members of the caucus, which she said numbers 78, are communists: "That would really be a surprise to us. ... I don’t know how anyone would know if someone was a card-carrying member unless he or she said they were," she said. Eric Johnson, a consultant for Murphy’s campaign, joked in response to West’s claim: "50 million Americans are living under communist rule if every member of the Progressive caucus is a communist." (He multiplied the 78 caucus members times the average district population of 646,000 based on the 2000 census. That gets you to about 50 million.) The Communist Party responds Communist Party USA does describe the Progressive Caucus as "our allies" on its website, and we found several other positive mentions of the Progressive Caucus on the site as well. But it also dishes out some criticism of Democrats in general as being "accommodationist." There are no members of Congress who are members of the Communist Party, said Libero Della Piana, vice president of the Communist Party USA, which has fewer than 5,000 members. Applicants have to apply through the national or local organizations and pay dues. Even if prospective members applied through a local group, Piana said he’d hear about it. (Generally, the party no longer issues cards. If someone asks for them, there are some older cards on hand.) "Trust me -- if a member of Congress applied to join the Communist Party we would know about it," Piana said. "It would set up some red flags -- pardon the pun." The Progressive Caucus promotes policies that the Communist Party thinks are better for the country than some promoted by other caucuses, but "our support of their policies does not mean they support us or our policies. That is pretty much guilt by association on steroids,’’ Piana said. We read West’s claim to Bertell Ollman, a professor who teaches political theory at New York University and an expert on Marxism. Ollman said he considers himself a Marxist and a communist with a small "c’’, since he’s not active in a political party. "I wish he was right," Ollman said of West’s claim. "If it was even 10 percent true I would be dancing in the streets. It would indicate that the Democrats are much more to the left than they really are." And what’s the difference between Marxism, communists and socialists? Ollman said Marxism is more of an analytical tool, looking at what capitalism is as a system and how it works for some and not others. Communists draw more on Marxism than socialists do and are generally critical of socialists for being too moderate. Also, he added, communists tend to argue a lot more among themselves about political theory. Our ruling West said, "I believe there's about 78 to 81 members of the Democrat Party who are members of the Communist Party." West said he was referring to the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and that the Communist Party has publicly referred to the Progressive Caucus as its ally. But just because the Communist Party has spoken positively about the Progressive Caucus doesn’t mean that the Democrats in that Caucus are communists. Heck, West has often pointed out that he and U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich -- a liberal Democrat from Ohio -- agreed on a resolution calling for withdrawing from Libya. That doesn’t make West a Democrat. West is using guilty by association here, and has failed to prove that any member of Congress is a communist. Pants on Fire!

pomt-01841	Republicans "went out of the way to praise (Eric) Holder's nomination. ... Not a single Republican senator opposed Eric Holder's nomination."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/16/rush-limbaugh/rush-limbaugh-revisits-gop-support-eric-holders-20/	In a recent edition of his talk radio show, Rush Limbaugh took umbrage at part of an interview that Attorney General Eric Holder gave to ABC News. During the interview with ABC, which aired on July 13, 2014, Holder suggested "there's a certain level of vehemence, it seems to me, that's directed at me, directed at the president," adding "there's a certain racial component to this for some people. I don't think this thing is a main driver, but for some there's a racial animus." Limbaugh countered that Republicans gave Obama and Holder a fair shake in 2009, when he was nominated to be attorney general. "The Republicans bent themselves into as many shapes as they could to agree with this president," Limbaugh said. "They went out of the way to praise Holder's nomination. I'll never forget that." Limbaugh went on to add, "By the way, not a single Republican senator opposed Eric Holder's nomination." Given that Holder’s tenure has subsequently become a focal point for Republican disapproval of the Obama administration, we wondered, did at least some Republican senators go "out of the way" to praise Holder’s nomination in 2009? And when it came time to vote on his nomination for attorney general, did every Republican vote to confirm him? We took a spin through the archives and found Limbaugh is partly correct. (He did not respond to an inquiry.) Did Republicans go out of their way to praise Holder’s nomination? They did -- at least a number of them did -- in public fashion. While Holder received a tough grilling from senators in both parties at his Senate Judiciary Committee hearing -- that’s the panel’s job, after all. Several Republican senators went out of their way to praise him in their introductory comments. And they weren’t just the most moderate members of the GOP caucus. For instance, Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., said, "Congratulations, Mr. Holder, on the nomination. You certainly bring excellent background and experience to the job as a federal prosecutor for a number of years and as a federal judge." Sessions even compared Holder favorably to a Republican attorney general, Alberto Gonzales. "I think you come to the office with far more experience than Attorney General Gonzales had," Sessions said. "I thought he was a good man, but when you lack experience, sometimes, you can make errors unintentionally. I think former Attorney General Janet Reno was a state prosecutor but was really inexperienced in a lot of the big issues that come before an attorney general." Then-Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., said he had "a number of questions to ask you, but I want to congratulate you and your family for an extraordinary American journey." Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, cited areas of common ground, including government transparency. "I don't want to speak for you, Mr. Holder, but I think you agreed that you would work with us to open up the government, to make it more transparent and more accountable," Cornyn said. And Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said, "I'm almost ready to vote for you right now." That appears to have been a joke -- the transcript reports that Graham’s comment was followed by laughter -- but other portions of Graham’s opening statement were more serious. "The president of the United States deserves the ability, within reason, to pick a lawyer in the attorney general that he or she has great confidence in," Graham said. "And the fact that this president has chosen you speaks well for you. And given your resume, even though we have probably a lot of political differences, I could understand why he has great confidence in you." Beyond the Senate, Holder received notable support from former Republican officials and officeholders. Former Reps. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., and Bob Barr, R-Ga. -- both of whom were managers of President Bill Clinton’s impeachment proceedings in the House -- wrote letters of support for Holder, according to the trade publication Main Justice. So did Manus Cooney, the top aide to Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Republican lawyers Ted Olson, George Terwilliger, Victoria Toensing and Joseph DiGenova. Of course, some of the senators’ comments could be characterized as simple good manners. Still, we do think they support Limbaugh’s assertion that Republicans "went out of the way to praise (Eric) Holder's nomination." Did no Republican senator oppose Holder's nomination? This is where Limbaugh’s claim outstrips the facts. When the Senate voted on Holder’s nomination on Feb. 2, 2009, he was confirmed by a vote of 75-21. Those voting in favor included 19 Republicans: Graham, Hatch and Sessions, plus Lamar Alexander (Tenn.), Robert Bennett (Utah), Kit Bond (Mo.), Saxby Chambliss (Ga.), Susan Collins (Maine), Bob Corker (Tenn.), Chuck Grassley (Iowa), Judd Gregg (N.H.), Johnny Isakson (Ga.), Jon Kyl (Ariz.), Richard Lugar (Ind.), John McCain (Ariz.), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Olympia Snowe (Maine), Arlen Specter (Pa.) and George Voinovich (Ohio). In fact, at the time, some conservative commentators were apoplectic that any Repubicans supported Holder. Michelle Malkin introduced the vote summary on her blog by writing, "Here are your 19 Bend Over Republicans who voted yes on Holder. Some disappointing names on the list in addition to the usual suspects." Among Holder’s 21 no votes -- all Republicans -- were two senators who offered praise during the committee hearing, Brownback and Cornyn. The other GOP senators who voted against Holder's nomination were: John Barrasso (Wyo.), Jim Bunning (Ky.), Richard Burr (N.C.), Tom Coburn (Okla.), Thad Cochran (Miss.), Mike Crapo (Idaho), Jim DeMint (S.C.), John Ensign (Nev.), Mike Enzi (Wyo.), Kay Bailey Hutchison (Texas), James Inhofe (Okla.), Mike Johanns (Neb.), Mitch McConnell (Ky.), Jim Risch (Idaho), Pat Roberts (Kan.), Richard Shelby (Ala.), John Thune (S.D.), David Vitter (La.), and Roger Wicker (Miss.). Holder ended up getting more no votes than some nominees received (such as former Sen. Hillary Clinton for Secretary of State, who was confirmed 94-2) but fewer no votes received by other nominees (for instance, Timothy Geithner for Treasury Secretary, 60-34, and Kathleen Sebelius for Health and Human Services, 65-31). So on Holder’s vote totals, Limbaugh is wrong. However, it’s worth noting that the previous time Holder faced Senate confirmation, he was confirmed without any Republican dissent. When he was nominated for deputy attorney general by Clinton in 1997, Holder won confirmation by a perfect 100-0 vote. However, there is no indication in the transcript of Limbaugh’s show that he was referring to Holder’s 1997 confirmation. The discussion on his show was about how Obama was treated after he took office in 2009. Our ruling Limbaugh said Republicans "went out of the way to praise (Eric) Holder's nomination. ... Not a single Republican senator opposed Eric Holder's nomination." He has a point that several prominent senators and other Republicans spoke highly of Holder as his nomination was being considered, but it’s not true that no GOP senator voted against Holder -- 21 did. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.	None	Rush Limbaugh	None	None	None	2014-07-16T13:00:57	2014-07-14	['Eric_Holder', 'Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-10697	"I do provide universal health care."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/03/barack-obama/he-says-universal-but-its-no-guarantee/	Under attack at a recent debate from rival Hillary Clinton on health care, Barack Obama shot back: "Well, let's talk about health care right now because the fact of the matter is that I do provide universal health care. The only difference between Sen. Clinton's health care plan and mine is that she thinks the problem for people without health care is that nobody has mandated — forced — them to get health care." Before jumping into this fray, it's important to note that when it comes to health care, the two Democratic presidential candidates have a lot in common. One of the few differences is that Clinton includes a universal mandate. That means that after everything else goes according to plan, individuals will be required by law to purchase insurance. Think of how people are required to buy auto insurance and you get an idea of what that might look like. Obama's plan includes a mandate to insure children, but it does not include a mandate for adults, as the Clinton and Edwards plans do. That likely means not as many people will be insured, said Kenneth Thorpe, professor of health policy and management at Emory University. Obama's decision not to include a mandate is a more cautious approach, one Obama says is designed not to penalize people with modest incomes. If premiums don't drop enough after all the reforms are implemented, people will still be unable to afford insurance. If a law mandates they buy it anyway, they probably won't. Obama's argument is that if you then fine them, you're essentially punishing the poor — and they will still be uninsured. Obama is betting that his plan will get costs low enough that many of the estimated 47-million uninsured will sign up without a mandate, and a mandate will come later. So is it fair for Obama to call his plan "universal"? Well, not really. Even if you buy his argument that his plan will create the market conditions to make health care universally available, nothing in his plan guarantees it. We rate his claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-09253	"This administration and this Congress have been systematically cutting funding to border security since the Democrats took control."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/05/mike-pence/republican-says-obama-cut-budget-illegal-immigrati/	While many Democrats have criticized Arizona's tough new immigration laws, it's many of those same Democrats who have made the illegal immigration problem worse in Arizona, U.S. Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana, chairman of the House Republican Conference, said in an interview on NBC's Meet the Press on May 2, 2010. "This administration and this Congress have been systematically cutting funding to border security since the Democrats took control," Pence said. Later, Pence was more specific. "Here's the numbers," Pence said. "Fiscal 2007, the last year Republicans wrote a budget, $1.2 billion for border security and fencing. By 2010 that was cut to $800 million ... I mean, the Democrats have cut three-quarters of a trillion out of this, and the president wants to go to 50 percent of the level that Republicans spent on border security. We have got to take border security seriously." Pence toggles between two statistics here, spending on border security and a subset of that, spending on border fencing. The fact is, between 2007 and now, while spending on border fencing has gone down, overall spending on border security has increased. Let's get to some numbers. In 2007, discretionary spending on border security was $6.3 billion. As Pence noted, that was the last year of full Republican control. After that, while George W. Bush remained in the presidency, Congress was controlled by Democrats. But discretionary spending on border security continued to rise year after year. It went to $7.9 billion in 2008; to $9.8 billion in 2009; and to $10.1 billion in fiscal year 2010. President Barack Obama's proposed 2011 budget calls for a slight decrease in discretionary spending on border security, but even at the proposed level of $9.8 billion, that's a 55 percent increase between 2007 and 2011. A spokesman in Pence's office said Pence was focusing specifically on funding for the border fence. Spending under the budget heading "border security, fencing, infrastructure and technology" has gone down -- from $1.2 billion in 2007 to $800 million this fiscal year. Obama's proposed 2011 budget calls for trimming the fence budget again, to $574 million. Funding for new border fencing surged in 2007 and 2008 after Republicans passed the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which called for the construction of hundreds of miles of new border fencing. Much of that fencing has been completed. The other major piece of the fencing budget is the so-called "virtual border fence" championed by Bush. Earlier this year, the Department of Homeland Security announced it was freezing funding for the "virtual border fence" along the U.S. Mexican border. The virtual fence -- which includes cameras, radar and ground sensors to detect illegal border crossings -- has been plagued by cost overruns, missed deadlines and technical bugs, such as the radar motion detector being unable to distinguish between humans and animals crossing the border. The program had gotten several dreadful reviews from the Government Accountability Office. So Pence is correct that border fence budgets have been trimmed since 2007. But Pence repeatedly said that funding for border security has been steadily cut by Democrats since 2007. And as we noted earlier, spending on border security has actually risen steadily. That's because Obama has focused more funding in other border security areas, such as increasing the number of border patrol officers. The 2011 proposed budget, for example, includes $94 million to expand the number of Customs and Border Patrol officers -- putting the country on target to reach Bush's goal of 20,000 officers. Between 2007 and 2011, the Border Patrol budget increased from $2.3 billion to $3.6 billion. The budget for inspections at ports of entry increased from $1.8 billion in 2007 to $2.9 billion in 2011. In addition, Obama's proposed 2011 budget calls for $1.6 billion for customs enforcement programs to identify and remove illegal aliens who commit crimes; and $137 million to expand immigration-related verification programs. "I would not say the Obama administration has cut back on border enforcement in general," said Marc Rosenblum, senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. Rather, Democrats have shifted funding from border fencing to other border security items, such as increasing the number of border patrol officers. "Most immigration experts will tell you that adding personnel is much more important than additional fencing," Rosenblum said. "No one thinks building fences, in and of itself, is very effective." That's a policy debate. But when Pence said "this administration and this Congress have been systematically cutting funding to border security since the Democrats took control," that's wrong. Funding for fencing is down, but funding for border security is up. In fact, discretionary spending on border security is up 55 percent between 2007 and 2011, even with a small proposed cut in 2011. We rate Pence's claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c10a8d81-2441-48cd-8144-d3c5f7a1fdcd	None	Mike Pence	None	None	None	2010-05-05T11:48:51	2010-05-02	['United_States_Congress', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-01953	Says of flood of non-Mexicans being apprehended at the border: "These are people that are coming from states like Syria that have substantial connections back to terrorist regimes and terrorist operations."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2014/jun/22/rick-perry/rick-perry-airs-ridiculous-unsupported-claim-about/	On the "Fox & Friends" program, Gov. Rick Perry bemoaned record-high apprehensions of individuals not from Mexico near the nation’s southern border. Perry then said: "These are people that are coming from states like Syria that have substantial connections back to terrorist regimes and terrorist operations." After Perry spoke, we confirmed the U.S. Border Patrol is setting at least a 17-year record for apprehensions near the border of individuals not from Mexico, rating that part of Perry’s statement True. On June 18, 2014, Perry and other state leaders ordered a surge in state spending on border security in the wake of an uptick in unaccompanied minors, many from Central America, crossing the Rio Grande. Is Perry also right that all these apprehended immigrants not from Mexico hail from countries with substantial ties to terrorist regimes and operations? In 2011, we rated as Half True a softer statement by U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, that in the first 19 months of Barack Obama’s presidency, the U.S. detained people from nations designated as state sponsors of terrorism on the southwestern border. While nearly everyone detained near the border was a Mexican national, Cornyn showed that in the cited period, there were 153 apprehensions of Cubans, 17 of Iranians, seven of Sudanese and two of Syrians. That fact check noted, too, that while an "apprehension" is an arrest for being in the United States illegally, the number of people actually detained will be smaller because some individuals are arrested more than once. When we sought backup for Perry’s 2014 statement, state officials offered no figures. After Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed said by email Perry drew on information from the Texas Department of Public Safety, DPS spokesman Tom Vinger replied to us by email: "On a regular basis, undocumented immigrants from countries with ties to or which sponsor terrorism are being apprehended by Border Patrol." He later named Syria, Somalia, Pakistan, Yemen and Afghanistan as such countries, adding that the department had no further response. Terrorist states, safe havens Next, we sought afresh to define a terrorist state, spotting online a U.S. State Department list of four nations "determined to have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism." They are Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Syria. Another agency web page lists about a dozen countries, as of 2013, considered "terrorist safe havens," which "include ungoverned, under-governed, or ill-governed physical areas where terrorists are able to organize, plan, raise funds, communicate, recruit, train, transit, and operate in relative security because of inadequate governance capacity, political will, or both." These included Somalia, Mali, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Yemen, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Colombia and Venezuela. Countries of origin And how many of the individuals stopped after crossing the border are coming from those countries? We were unable to come up with up-to-date data. By telephone, Dennis Smith, a Del Rio spokesman for the Border Patrol, guided us to a chart in the agency’s "2012 Yearbook of Immigration Statistics" indicating dozens of countries of origin for more than 643,000 individuals apprehended in the 12 months through September 2012. We set aside the 448,697 individuals from Mexico, finding that about 7,800 of the apprehended individuals -- 4 percent of the non-Mexican detainees -- hailed either from the U.S.-designated terrorist states or 10 "safe haven" countries. Some specifics: Cuba, 4,041 detainees; Iran, 276 individuals; Sudan, 220 individuals; and Syria, 56 individuals. Border Patrol officials didn't offer more recent information. But when we reached out to Megan Mitchell, a Cornyn aide, she emailed us a chart she attributed to a House committee showing countries of origin for the Border Patrol’s 153,055 OTM apprehensions in the 12 months through September 2013. According to the chart, 577, or 0.4 percent of such apprehensions, involved people from the government’s identified terrorist states or safe havens with Colombia accounting for the biggest single share, 457. From Iran, the chart showed, there were 7 apprehensions; from Cuba, 4; from Syria, 2; and from Sudan, 1. Countries with most immigrants removed from U.S. Analyst Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that seeks to reduce immigration, helped us see another way to probe this topic by turning to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency within Homeland Security responsible for deporting people not legally authorized to be in the United States. ICE published a report and chart in December 2013 showing no countries outside the Western Hemisphere ranked among the top 10 countries of origin for immigrants returned to home countries by the U.S. government in the 12 months that ran through September of that year. Alone among them, Colombia is one of the U.S.-designated terrorist havens. In the period, the agency said, "Mexico continued to be the leading country of origin for those removed" from the United States, "followed by Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador." Removed Population by Citizenship* October 2012 through September 2013 Citizenship Total Mexico 241,493 Guatemala 47,769 Honduras 37,049 El Salvador 21,602 Dominican Republic 2,462 Ecuador 1,616 Brazil 1,500 Colombia 1,429 Nicaragua 1,383 Jamaica 1,119 Top 10 Total 357,422 *This counts individuals caught near border and beyond Source: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, December 2013 (accessed June 19, 2014) According to the report, the government removed 90,461 people from countries other than Mexico who had been caught by the Border Patrol after crossing the border--a 27 percent increase from the year before. Around the country, overall, ICE removed 368,644 individuals, the report said. Put another way, the top 10 countries--all but Mexico, the Dominican Republic and Jamaica located in Central and South America--accounted for 97 percent of the foreigners removed. By email, Vaughan said her search of an ICE database covering 2013 yielded "a handful of cases of aliens who had been arrested by the Border Patrol who were citizens of countries linked to terrorism and had crossed the border illegally from Mexico recently. There were 2 from Nigeria, 3 from Pakistan, 1 from Egypt, 1 from Morocco and 1 from Afghanistan," she wrote. "All were between the ages of 26 and 50." Generally, Vaughan said, "some" border crossers detained by the Border Patrol originated in terrorist states. By phone, she said the majority of OTM apprehensions have long involved people from Central America. Also to our inquiry, Douglas Massey, a Princeton University professor expert on immigration, questioned Perry’s claim, emailing us charts he made indicating that over the past decade, apprehensions of individuals from non-terrorist states have far outnumbered individuals from terrorist-linked nations. See Massey’s charts here. "Apprehensions of nationals from potential terrorist nations are not increasing," Massey said. Our ruling Speaking of a flood of immigrants from countries other than Mexico being apprehended at the U.S-Mexico border, Perry said, "These are people that are coming from states like Syria that have substantial connections back to terrorist regimes and terrorist operations." The latest available data show that less than 5 percent of "other than Mexican" apprehensions in the last two completed federal fiscal years involved people from U.S.-designated terrorist states or safe havens. Perry, in contrast, placed all such people being apprehended by U.S. border officials into that category, a conclusion neither the governor or the agency described as his source backed up with evidence.

pomt-11177	"The #irandeal ultimately would have guaranteed Iran a nuclear bomb capable of reaching the US."	false	/north-carolina/statements/2018/may/22/david-rouzer/congressman-deal-ensured-iran-could-hit-us-nuclear/	Most congressional Republicans applauded as President Donald Trump announced plans to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement. Among them was Rep. David Rouzer, a Republican from southeastern North Carolina. Rouzer argued (accurately) on Twitter that Iran is the top state sponsor of terrorism. But then he went a step further. "The #irandeal ultimately would have guaranteed Iran a nuclear bomb capable of reaching the US," Rouzer tweeted on May 8. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com PolitiFact has heard and reported on a lot of rhetoric surrounding the Iran deal, an agreement signed in 2015 by Iran, the United States, and other nations and championed by former President Barack Obama. In Rouzer’s claim about a nuclear bomb "capable of reaching the U.S.," the word "guaranteed" stands out to us. We contacted Rouzer’s office and asked for evidence to support his claim. His staffer, Danielle Smotkin, referenced three people’s comments to support the congressman’s claim: In an April 2015 interview with NBC’s Meet the Press, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran was developing intercontinental ballistic missiles to reach the United States. In an August 2015 interview with an Iranian news outlet, a member of Iran’s negotiating team said Iran expected to reach "complete industrial (uranium) enrichment" eight years after the deal. In October 2017, Iranian Major-General Mohammad Ali Jafari said Iran’s missiles can hit U.S. forces and interests within 2,000 kilometers, which is 1,200 miles. About that missile range: That means Iran is capable of reaching U.S. interests in the Middle East, but isn’t capable of striking the United States mainland — 7,200 miles away. (PolitiFact has written before about how likely it is that Iran will develop intercontinental ballistic missiles.) The Iran deal, officially titled the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, puts a cap on how much uranium Iran can enrich until 2030. How it works As part of the deal, Iran drastically limited its ability to build a weapon by giving up 97 percent of its enriched uranium stockpile when it signed the deal. Iran could also build a weapon with plutonium, but the agreement bans plutonium reactors for 15 years and stipulates that Iran must dismantle its current one. Some of the deal’s terms last forever, including a ban on nuclear weapon design and manufacturing. The Additional Protocol, separate inspection guidelines for the International Atomic Energy Agency, improves international oversight of nuclear fuel. It also allows broader inspections, such as collecting environmental samples at any location to detect radioactive materials. "In fact, the text of the JCPOA explicitly states that ‘under no circumstances will Iran ever seek, develop or acquire any nuclear weapons’," said Elena Chachko, coordinator of Harvard’s Empirical Legal Studies Series and a doctoral student at its law school. So the deal, on paper, restricts Iran from building nuclear weapons. And so does an agreement among about 190 countries to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, Chachko said. "As a non-nuclear-weapon state under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), Iran is banned from acquiring nuclear weapons under international law regardless of the JCPOA," she said. A broader point David Albright, founder of the Institute for Science and International Security, suggested that the public not judge Rouzer’s words in the literal sense. He agreed with Rouzer’s broader point that, years from now, Iran could have enough materials to secretly build a nuclear bomb. The Iran deal "kicked the can down the road and did not settle the question of Iran building nuclear weapons," he said. Ian Williams, managing editor of Missile Threat, a product of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, agreed. "The deal does not completely block the path" toward a nuclear bomb, Williams said. "On a very fundamental level, it leaves them everything they would need," he said. However, the Iran deal "definitely made it harder" to make a bomb. However, "the tweet is inaccurate. It makes it seem like, in 10 years, we will give them a nuclear weapon," Williams said. Our ruling Rouzer tweeted that the Iran deal "ultimately would have guaranteed Iran a nuclear bomb capable of reaching the US." For one thing, the deal didn't promise Iran a nuclear weapon. In fact, language in the deal — and in the separate Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty — bans Iran from possessing such a weapon. Experts acknowledge the deal didn't necessarily prevent Iran from getting the bomb — but said it made it more difficult. Further, Iran is currently limited to missile strikes within a 1,200-mile range, not nearly far enough to reach the United States. We rate this statement False.

pomt-12515	Says Eric Trump said, "My father’s tax return is irrelevant because we’re going to cancel taxes for WEALTHY people anyway."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/apr/25/democraticmomscom/fake-news-story-claims-eric-trump-said-donald-trum/	A fake Internet post on a website filled with extremely left-leaning stories quoted Eric Trump as saying President Donald Trump was going to end taxes for the rich, making the release of his father’s tax returns irrelevant. The headline on an April 17, 2017, post on DemocraticMoms.com read, "Eric Trump: ‘My father’s tax return is irrelevant because we’re going to cancel taxes for WEALTHY people anyway.’" The story was flagged by Facebook users as possibly being fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to crack down on fake news. The post focuses on Donald Trump’s past promise to release his tax returns, referring to a tweet he sent out on April 16: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com DemocraticMoms.com cites a fake interview Eric Trump supposedly gave with "KXYL Radio." The post reads: "Eric argued that Trump’s tax return is ‘irrelevant,’ largely because ‘he knows all there is to know about following the letter of the law, especially when it comes to paying taxes.’ He said, ‘When you come from a background like the one my father comes from, you have to know all there is about paying taxes and doing your part to make this country a better place.’" The post goes on, but we know it’s fake, because it steals its content almost entirely from an April 16 story on Politicalo.com. The site is related to Newslo.com, which refers to itself in a disclaimer as "the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web." Stories on sites under the Newslo.com umbrella take a small bite of real news or quotes by real people and build fake stories around them. They feature a pair of buttons that allow readers to highlight the true parts of their stories, so readers can conceivably know the difference. But on other sites without the buttons, there’s no way to know. It appears DemocraticMoms.com edited some of the details of the original post, such as deleting Politicalo.com’s reference to another April 16 Donald Trump tweet backing off his promise to label China a currency manipulator: See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com The headline also has been changed. The original on Politicalo.com read, "Eric Trump: ‘My father’s tax return is irrelevant because we’re going to cancel taxes for "extra productive people" anyway.’" DemocraticMoms.com subbed in the word WEALTHY instead, IN ALL CAPS for extra effect. Otherwise, the story contains entire paragraphs of Politicalo.com’s story (Neither version notes that the radio interview is fake; Politicalo.com calls KXYL an Orlando station, but it’s based in Texas.) DemocraticMoms.com has a cryptic About Us description that says only that their "team will bring you everything you wanted to know, and some stuff you didn’t even know you needed!" There was no apparent way to contact the site, but every post was steeped in anti-Trump fervor. No author information accompanies the profile that posted the article, either. DemocraticMoms.com was registered anonymously on Nov. 20, 2016, after Donald Trump was elected The owner is likely looking to capitalize on anti-Trump sentiment. In this case, it’s by posting a parody story and implying it’s real. It’s clear Eric Trump didn’t say his dad was going to end taxes entirely for anyone, rich or otherwise.

pomt-08158	Said Republicans made historic gains in state legislatures during last month’s election	true	/georgia/statements/2010/dec/03/national-review/gop-made-historic-gains-state-level-year/	Just hours after the November election ended, the conservative journal National Review boasted online that the GOP had enjoyed a historic win. Not in Congress, but in state houses across the nation. That’s not a new story in Georgia, which elected its first Republican governor since Reconstruction in 2002. A few years later, both chambers of the state Legislature had GOP majorities. Those majorities increased in the 2010 election cycle, and a half-dozen lawmakers elected as Democrats on Nov. 2 have fled to the GOP in the election's aftermath. But nationally, did Republicans actually pick up historic ground in state legislatures in last month’s election as the National Review stated? PolitiFact Georgia checked with Tim Storey, an elections analyst with the National Conference of State Legislatures and a guy who knows about as much about political shifts at the state level as anyone around. "It’s a much different landscape than it was prior to the election," Storey said. The Colorado-based Storey said Republicans gained 691 state legislative seats in the November election. Nationwide, they now hold 3,928 seats to 3,366 for Democrats. "It was definitely historic gains," he said in a telephone interview. "It’s the most GOP [state] legislators since 1928." Republicans had the momentum going into the election, he said, but some questioned whether the GOP could surpass its 1994 performance, when the GOP picked up 525 seats at the state level. They easily surpassed that number and saw the biggest party shift in legislative seats since 1966, Storey said. Some of the state pickups surprised even the experts. Minnesota, the same state that made Democrat Al Franken a U.S. senator in 2008, saw its Legislature taken over by the GOP. And the Michigan House of Representatives went Republican. The GOP tilt was even greater in the South, where state-level offices had been trending Republican for two decades. Still, when the election began, 14 legislative chambers in the South were controlled by Democrats and 14 by Republicans. When the dust cleared, 19 of the region’s 28 chambers were controlled by Republicans. The 2010 election cycle in the South represents a "historic tipping point," Storey said. For the first time since Reconstruction, the GOP holds a majority of chambers and seats. The online journal Politico recently ran the headline "Democratic South finally falls." The change has been going on for some time, writer Jonathan Martin noted in the article. "But what this year’s elections, and the subsequent party switching, have made unambiguously clear is that the last ramparts have fallen and political realignment has finally taken hold in the South’s last citadels of Democratic strength: the state houses," Martin wrote. Democrats lost both chambers of the legislatures in Alabama and North Carolina. Democrats now control both legislative chambers in just two Southern states, Arkansas and Mississippi. The realignment of power in the state legislatures can have enormous consequences. State lawmakers soon will begin the process of redrawing political boundaries, a process known as redistricting that occurs every 10 years. The party in power will obviously try to draw those lines to benefit itself, so the GOP romp of 2010 could have some real staying power. We rate the National Review claim of historic GOP gains as True.	None	National Review	None	None	None	2010-12-03T06:00:00	2010-11-03	['None']
pomt-04384	"President Barack Obama (is) the first president in history to cut Medicare by $700 billion."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2012/oct/19/ohio-republican-party/ohio-republican-party-says-obama-cut-medicare-700-/	Claims about the Affordable Care Act, commonly called Obamacare, were staples of congressional campaigns in 2010. Many have resurfaced, or simply continued, in the 2012 federal elections. Several appear in a brochure sent to voters by the Ohio Republican Party in support of Mitt Romney's presidential campaign. Aimed specifically at seniors, the brochure says they can count on Romney, but not on President Obama, "the first president in history to cut Medicare by $700 billion." If the claim has a familiar ring to it, it’s because it similar to others that PolitiFact has reviewed. But its continued use, including in the presidential and vice-presidential debates, makes it worth another look. The "cut" refers to an aspect of the Affordable Care Act, the health care reform known as Obamacare. There are cuts and then there are CUTS. Neither Obama nor his health care law literally "cut" a dollar from the budget of Medicare, which operates as a government-run health insurance plan for Americans over age 65. Rather, the health care law instituted a number of changes to reduce the growth of Medicare costs. At the time the law was passed, those reductions amounted to $500 billion over the next 10 years. Time’s passage has only boosted that number. What kind of spending reductions? They were mainly aimed at insurance companies and hospitals, not beneficiaries. The law makes significant reductions to Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. Medicare Advantage was started under President George W. Bush, and the idea was that competition among the private insurers would reduce costs. But the plans have actually cost more than traditional Medicare. So the health care law scales back the payments to private insurers. Hospitals, too, will be paid less if they have too many re-admissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care. Still, the overall Medicare budget is projected to continue to increase. The health care law tries to limit that growth, making it less than it would have been without the law. But it doesn’t reduce its overall budget. That’s why claims that Obama would "cut" Medicare need more explanation to be fully accurate. And in the past, PolitiFact has rated similar statements Half True or Mostly False, depending on the wording and context. Because Medicare spending gets bigger every year, the cost-saving mechanisms in the health care law also get bigger. Also, it takes a few years for the health care law’s savings mechanisms to kick in. In fact, the effects of time are the main reason the $500 billion number has turned into $700 billion. The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan agency with expert staff that generates projections about how laws affect the federal budget and economy, determined in 2011 that the federal health care law would reduce Medicare outlays by $507 billion between 2012 and 2021. In a more recent estimate released this year, the CBO looked at the years 2013 to 2022 and determined the health care law affected Medicare outlays by $716 billion. That CBO estimate is cited as the supporting source for the claim in the brochure, that Obama is "the first president in history to cut Medicare by $700 billion." That claim is partially accurate. That amount refers to the savings expected from Obamacare’s reductions in growth of Medicare spending over 10 years, primarily paid to insurers and hospitals. Those savings were credited to the health care law to keep it from adding to the deficit. What the law does not do, as the claim implies, is chop $700 billion that was already allocated to Medicare for its programs.. One other point worth noting: The changes that lead to the projected savings are a result of legislation that was approved by both houses of Congress and signed into law by Obama -- not as a result of an executive order or decision Obama made individually in his administration. Those are important details that give context to the statement. On the Truth-O-Meter, the Ohio Republican Party’s claim rates Half True.
