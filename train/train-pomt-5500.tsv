pomt-01750	Says Rick Scott "raised property taxes."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/aug/01/charlie-crist/rick-scott-raised-property-taxes-charlie-crist-say/	Sorting through this year’s gubernatorial campaign attacks has long since become taxing -- namely, who raised taxes and how much they’ve cost voters. The latest charge from Democratic challenger Charlie Crist comes from a campaign ad released July 31, 2014. In it, he attacked Republican incumbent Gov. Rick Scott’s budget decisions. "Rick Scott raised property taxes," the ad said. A narrator doubles down on the claim, saying Scott raised "your" property taxes. Scott came into office promising to cut property taxes, so PolitiFact Florida thought this claim deserved an audit. Did Rick Scott raise Florida’s property taxes? We’ll budget some time to sort this one out. Taxes for schools Crist’s campaign said the claim came from a May 5, 2014, story in the Tampa Tribune detailing a projected increase in the property taxes municipalities contribute to public schools. This portion of your property tax bill, called the Required Local Effort, has been a Scott target since his 2010 campaign, when he promised to cut the rate first by one and later by two mills over seven years (we rated both Promise Broken). Both the Legislature and the governor have a say in the millage rate, which is used to calculate taxes on the assessed value of a property (one mill is equal to $1 in taxes per $1,000 in value). When Scott took office, the rate was 5.38 mills, which then went up to 5.446 in 2011, but was set at 5.18 in 2013. For 2014, Scott and the Legislature didn’t move the rate either up or down, leaving it at 5.18. Because of the way the rate is calculated, the state Department of Education in July adjusted the rate down to 5.08 mills. That’s important to note, because that means this year’s rate is actually lower than the year before. With a steady increase in property values across the state, the current rate will be bringing in more tax money than before, despite no action from the governor or lawmakers. "If Charlie Crist is accusing us of raising property tax rates, that’s just not true," Scott campaign spokesperson Matt Moon told PolitiFact Florida. Instead, Crist is focusing on the higher tax revenue. The latest Florida Education Finance Program calculations from the Department of Education estimate collections for the Required Local Effort would increase by about $370 million in an $18.9 billion budget. Critics (including the Crist campaign) have equated that rise in collections with a tax increase. Crist campaign spokesman Kevin Cate told PolitiFact Florida "inaction is also an action. And in this case, Rick Scott’s actions raised taxes." If that’s the case, the same logic could apply to Crist. The campaign doesn’t mention that Crist also oversaw changes in both the tax rate and collections from the Required Local Effort. We checked the rates and collections going back to before former Gov. Crist took office in 2007 and found that Crist also saw ups and downs among both. Fiscal year budget RLE millage tax rate Governor RLE tax collections 2006-07 5.01 Jeb Bush $7.3 billion 2007-08 4.84 Crist $7.9 billion 2008-09 5.136 Crist $8.24 billion 2009-10 5.288 Crist $7.8 billion 2010-11 5.38 Crist $7.19 billion 2011-12 5.446 Scott $6.9 billion 2012-13 5.295 Scott $6.7 billion 2013-14 5.18 Scott $6.8 billion 2014-15 5.08 Scott $7.17 billion Most notable is 2007, Crist’s first year, when the budget lowered the tax rate. But because of increasing taxable values just before the Great Recession, tax collections still went up. In subsequent years, Crist-era budgets kept raising the tax rate but saw falling collections by the end of his term. The current rate and projected collections under Scott are both less than they were during Crist’s last approved budget. Our ruling Crist said, "Rick Scott raised property taxes." As Florida homeowners know, the taxes they pay are based on both tax rates and what the current property values are. What Crist means is that because taxable values are rising, collections from school property taxes are going up, even though the tax rate for the Required Local Effort is not going up. Scott did sign a budget his first year that briefly raised those rates, but collections dropped anyway -- a phenomenon that happened to Crist, as well. Even as collections are projected to increase, both the rates and tax revenue are now less than when Scott took office. Collections are increasing because property values are going up after a historic recession and loss of real estate values. Given all these factors, we rate Crist’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-10642	Barack Obama "wants the government to take over health care, spend hundreds of billions of dollars of new money for health insurance for everyone."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/06/mitt-romney/obama-plan-not-a-takeover/	In a question at a New Hampshire debate, the Republican candidates were asked how they would campaign against Barack Obama if he wins the Democratic nomination. Mitt Romney's first response was to argue that Obama "wants the government to take over health care, spend hundreds of billions of dollars of new money for health insurance for everyone." Problem is, Obama's plan keeps the free-market health care system intact, particularly employer-based insurance. His plan expands existing programs for the uninsured by increaseing eligibility for the poor and children to enroll in initiatives like Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program. His plan also creates pools for individuals to buy their own cheaper insurance. And it outlines several strategies aimed at reining in costs for everyone, such as streamlining medical record-keeping and emphasizing preventative care. Romney is also off when he says that Obama wants to spend hundreds of billions of dollars. The Obama campaign has said that Obama believes the cost will be less than $100-billion — between $50-billion and $65-billion. Romney is correct when he says Obama wants to cover everyone; Obama has said that is his goal. But Obama has no mandate requiring that adults buy health insurance. How many people would remain uninsured has become a hot issue in the Democratic primary. (See our coverage of this issue here . ) At best, Romney is wrong on two out of three points in his attack on the Obama health plan. It's not a government takeover and the purported cost is less than what Romney stated. For these reasons, we rate Romney's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-11420	"Court orders Obama to pay $400 million in restitution."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/mar/19/daily-world-update/no-barack-obama-does-not-owe-400-million-restituti/	Rumors have spread that a fake court ordered former President Barack Obama to pay $400 million in restitution fees back to the American people. "Court orders Obama to pay $400 million in restitution," reads the headline on Daily World Update, a blog site claiming to produce fictitious material and conservative satire. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. The article cites the nonexistent West Texas Federal Appeals Court as ordering Obama to repay the $400 million. While there is a federal court serving the Western district of Texas, it is not an appeals court, and there is no official court that matches the name of the one mentioned in the story. The judges named in the fake news article are also made up. They listed Gary Jones, Amanda Perry and Kris Weinshenker as the primary judges who handled the case. When searching for them, we found no results of anyone by these names who serve in legal or judicial practices. The story attributed quotes to the fake judges accusing Obama of having done incomparable economic damage to the United States and evaluating the outcome of the restitution fees. The story claims the $400 million fees come from money that was "lost" in an illegal transaction with Iranian hard-liners. We suspect the reference comes from a $400 million payment made to Iran in 2016 for that amount which was part of a $1.7 billion settlement. PolitiFact fact-checked claims that this payment was a "ransom" deal when Iran released five American prisoners back to the United States on the same day that the payment was transferred by cash to Iran. The initial $400 million has been owed to Iran since 1979 when Iran purchased American fighter jets which the U.S. didn’t deliver following the Islamic Revolution. The payment is actually part of a $1.7 billion payment, in which an additional $1.3 billion serves as interest. Our ruling A fake news article claimed that a court ordered Obama to pay the American public $400 million in repayment fees due to an illegal transaction with Iran. The court and its judges were fictitious and the payment was a reference to a legitimate transaction given to Iran that the United States owed in 2016. We rate this Pants on Fire.

pomt-04009	Says his budget provides "the highest state funding level in history" for education.	half-true	/florida/statements/2013/feb/06/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-his-budget-proposal-has-highest-st/	Gov. Rick Scott trumpeted his "Florida Families First" budget as providing record-breaking money for schools, including $2,500 raises for teachers. "This total includes $10.7 billion in state funding for Florida K-12 schools, the highest state funding level in history," Scott said in a Jan. 31, 2013, news conference about his 2013-14 budget recommendations. The crowd of teachers and university presidents huddled around Scott applauded his comment. We thought it merited another look. Overall education spending vs. state spending Scott was very careful to specify state funding for education would be higher than ever in his proposed budget. But schools are funded by more sources than the state. The complex school-funding formula includes local taxes and, in recent years, federal stimulus dollars, too. Scott’s press team directed us to a breakdown of state and local school funding for the past 10 years. It does not include federal stimulus funding.The blue bar represents state funding, the green bar represents local funding, and the orange horizontal line at the top represents per-pupil funding. Looking at education spending this way excludes $1.78 billion in economic stimulus money Florida received to bolster its 2009-10 and 2010-11 budgets, so spending in those years should actually appear slightly closer to Scott’s new proposal. Let’s take a closer look at the education spending Scott proposed. He wants the state to spend $18.47 billion for education during the 2013-14 school year. Again, the state’s share of that would be about $10.7 billion. So if the Legislature passes a budget that precisely mirrors Scott’s education proposals, the state’s share of education spending would be its highest since 2007-08, when it was $9.71 billion. In terms of the state’s actual dollar investment, Scott is right that it would be the highest. However, total state and local education spending in Scott’s budget would be $280 million smaller than the 2007-08 budget signed by Gov. Charlie Crist. What’s in the $1.2 billion increase from last year’s education spending? About $480 million would go toward teacher raises and $300 million would go toward the unfunded liability of the state’s retirement system. There’s some debate as to whether the pension funding should be considered part of an education increase, but a couple experts told us it’s reasonable because past calculations of the state’s per-pupil funding have included the cost of teacher wages, part of which goes to the retirement system. Breaking it down per student Of course, there are other ways of looking at state education spending. One is to look at spending per student. As a whole, counting state and local funding, per-pupil funding under Scott’s new budget would be $6,799. That’s short of what it was before the economic recession, when per-pupil funding peaked in 2007-08 at $7,126. So back then, the state had fewer students and was providing more money for each. Now we have 85,000 more students, according to DOE numbers, but less money for each one. But if you only look at the state’s per-pupil level of $3,941 in Scott’s new budget, it does exceed funding levels for the past 10 years in terms of actual dollars. And inflation? We’ll close with a point about inflation. When adjusted for inflation, does Scott’s budget still stand up as the state’s biggest education investment? We used a Consumer Price Index calculator from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to compare Scott’s proposal with state spending on education for the past 10 years. (BLS has not released CPI data for January 2013, so the comparisons use 2012 inflation rates.) The takeaway is that state spending on education, when adjusted for inflation, would not be significantly different than it was from 2004 to 2007. Still, even the Florida Education Association, the state teachers union that sued Scott over the 2011 merit pay plan, conceded the state has never invested more, and that it is reasonable to consider the proposed $300 million contribution to the state’s retirement system as part of the $1.2 billion increase for education. "Added money spent on public schools always helps grow our economy," said FEA President Andy Ford in a statement. "We look forward to the governor’s strong advocacy of this proposal." Our ruling Scott said his budget "includes $10.7 billion in state funding for Florida K-12 schools, the highest state funding level in history." Floridians hearing this statement might think that means education funding for Florida schools has never been higher. That's not the case. Actually, Scott is referring only to the state government's specific contribution to overall spending. Scott drums up the state share as an historic investment, and it is in terms of actual dollars. But there are also local and federal dollars that fund Florida schools. When you consider those, Scott's overall recommendation for education spending is still short of what Florida students received before the economic crash. It's about the same as it was under Gov. Jeb Bush when considering inflation. Scott’s claim is partially accurate, but it leaves out important details that would give a different impression. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-13254	"Of course, there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/17/donald-trump/donald-trumps-pants-fire-claim-large-scale-voter-f/	Donald Trump tripled down on his baseless claim that the U.S. election system is rigged against him, capping a weekend of lashing out at the media for publishing "fabricated" allegations of sexual assault and at Alec Baldwin for impersonating Trump on Saturday Night Live. House Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republicans defended the Election Day process at an Oct. 15 rally, but Trump continued to blame the media for "pushing Crooked Hillary" and added that rigging is happening at "many polling places." "Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day. Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on? So naive!" Trump tweeted the morning of Oct. 17. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The Trump campaign reiterated Trump’s stance that the cards are stacked against Trump, pointing to a column from The Hill's media reporter Joe Concha on how the media could influence voter perceptions of Trump. To be clear, this is not the same thing as a voter committing fraud. The Trump campaign also pointed us to a 2012 Pew Center study that estimated about 24 million, equal to one in every eight, voter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or are inaccurate. But as we have previously reported, no evidence of voter fraud was found — this is about record-keeping that is badly managed and in disarray. The other piece of evidence offered by the Trump campaign is a 2014 study that says approximately 6.4 percent of noncitizens voted in 2008 and 2.2 percent in 2010. That study has been criticized by election experts for using an unreliable database of Internet respondents. And finally, the Trump campaign forwarded us reports of voting irregularities in swing states like Pennsylvania, Colorado and Virginia. But these reports were either of reported and prevented cases of fraud or isolated instances. They do not amount to rampant, widespread fraud or assert that the few cases affected the outcome of an election. Voter fraud is rare. Trump talking about it is not. Voter fraud isn’t a catch-all term for any election shenanigan. Voter fraud is rare and refers to illegal interference in voting, such as ballot stuffing, voter impersonation or vote buying. Before his White House bid, Trump tweeted about dead voters delivering President Barack Obama’s victory in 2012, floated charges about multiple voting in the primaries, and suggested that undocumented immigrants "just walk in and vote" in some polling places. These charges do not reflect reality. News 21, a national investigative reporting project funded by the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, found 150 alleged cases of double voting, 56 cases of noncitizens voting, and 10 cases of voter impersonation across all elections from 2000 to 2011. Many of these allegations never led to charges, while others were acquitted or dismissed. Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School and an expert on voter fraud, found an even smaller number: 31 credible incidents out of more than 1 billion votes cast from 2000 to 2014. Put it in another way: More people are struck by lightning or attacked by sharks than are accused of voter fraud. When voter fraud does occur, it’s not always intentional. Multiple studies have traced known cases not to willful deception but to clerical errors or confusion. For example, one case of a dead person voting (Alan J. Mandell) happened because a poll worker accidentally marked his name instead of the man who actually cast the ballot, Alan J. Mandel. Similarly, in one of just five cases of a noncitizen voting between 2000 and 2004, a permanent resident was told he was eligible and given a voter registration form by a DMV clerk when renewing his license. So, given the rarity of occurrence, the lack of intent, and a federal penalty of a $10,000 fine or up to five years in prison, experts say it would be extremely difficult to rig an election through the ways Trump has decried. "I'd like to see him try to vote 10 times on Election Day. It would be virtually impossible and a knuckle-headed way to try to corrupt an election," Lorraine Minnite, a political science professor at Rutgers University who wrote The Myth of Voter Fraud, previously told PolitiFact. For double or triple voting to sway an election, an army of voters would have to visit multiple polling locations each, know the names and addresses of the people they were impersonating and produce fake IDs (in many states) or forge their signatures — plus commit to committing perjury the entire time. "Campaigns don’t pay people to pretend to be people they’re not. That’s too stupid," said Mary Frances Berry, former chairwoman of the U.S Commission on Civil Rights and author of Five Dollars and a Pork Chop Sandwich, a book about electoral fraud. So there is no evidence of a massive attempt to rig the election on and before Election Day. Collusion confusion Trump elaborated on his voter fraud theory a few hours after his initial tweet. "Voter fraud! Crooked Hillary Clinton even got the questions to a debate, and nobody says a word. Can you imagine if I got the questions?" he tweeted. His follow-up is not evidence of large-scale voter fraud, though it does bring up a separate concern revealed by Wikileaks. Trump is referring to an email obtained by Wikileaks from then-CNN contributor and Democratic strategist Donna Brazile with the subject line, "From time to time, I get the the questions in advance." "Here’s one that worries me about HRC," Brazile wrote to Clinton’s communications director Jennifer Palmieri on March 12, 2016. "Should Ohio and the 30 other states join the current list and abolish the death penalty?" Palmieri wrote back: "Hi. Yes, it is one she gets asked about. Not everyone likes her answer but can share it." The next day, CNN co-moderated a Democratic primary town hall, and one person asked Clinton about the death penalty. But Brazile, who is now interim Democratic National Committee chairwoman, has denied that she notified the Clinton camp of the question and says she never had access to the questions in the first place. (The Clinton campaign has yet to confirm or deny the authenticity of the emails.) A CNN spokesperson told Politico, "we have never, ever given a town hall question to anyone beforehand." CNN host Jake Tapper, one of the debate moderators, called the leak "very, very upsetting," and the network has blamed debate partner TV One as the source. This is concerning, but none of it is evidence of voter fraud. Our ruling Trump said, "Of course, there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day." Actual instances of voter fraud — such as voter impersonation, ballot stuffing and bought votes — are extremely rare, often unintentional and not on a scale large enough to affect a national election. Trump's alarming claim, once again, is without proof. We rate Trump’s claim Pants on Fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/43048df5-6484-4ff3-b329-62f96846cd82 Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly characterized Joe Concha's current job title.

pomt-14888	Says he balanced the Milwaukee County budget "without raising taxes five years in a row."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/nov/10/chris-abele/chris-abele-claims-hes-balanced-5-milwaukee-county/	Facing an election challenge from a state senator in his own party, Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele unveiled two campaign ads on Nov. 2, 2015. Both TV spots make the same boast about taxes. In the ad titled "Foundation," the narrator puts it this way: "As county executive, he balanced the budget without raising taxes, five years in a row." Really? Then why is the property tax levy millions of dollars higher than when Abele took office? It’s been well documented that the county Board of Supervisors has generally raised property taxes in making changes to Abele’s budgets. But Abele has, in his own way, adopted those increases as well. The numbers Abele has proposed five county budgets since winning a special election in April 2011 to finish out the final year of Scott Walker’s term, after Walker was elected governor. Abele won a full four-year term in 2012, running unopposed. But he faces a serious challenge from state Sen. Chris Larson of Milwaukee in the April 2016 election. (Although both Abele and Larson are Democrats, the county executive position is officially nonpartisan.) As the following table shows, for each of his five budgets, Abele proposed a property tax levy freeze -- in other words, he proposed levying the same total amount of property taxes that was levied the previous year. But it’s also clear that Abele’s proposed levy has increased every year, and was $13 million higher in 2016 than it was in 2012. Budget Year Property tax levy proposed by Abele` Property tax levy adopted by County Board following vetoes and veto overrides 2011 (Proposed by Scott Walker) $269.6 million 2012 $269.6 million $275.4 million 2013 $275.4 million $279.3 million 2014 $279.3 million $279.3 million 2015 $279.3 million $282.9 million 2016 $282.9 million $287 million* *The County Board on Nov. 9, 2015, adopted the 2016 budget, though Abele can still issue vetoes. The pattern was essentially the same each year: Abele proposed a budget that would have frozen the levy. The County Board approved changes in the budget that -- except for 2014, when the levy stayed the same -- raised the levy. Abele issued a number of budget vetoes, some or all of which were overridden by the County Board. The result was that, except for 2014, the County Board ultimately adopted a budget that contained a property tax levy larger than what Abele proposed. So, by proposing the freezes, and issuing the vetoes, each year, Abele tried to keep the property levy from going up. But when it came time to propose a budget for the next year, Abele used the previous year’s levy. In other words, each year, Abele took advantage of the fact that the County Board had adopted a levy that was higher than he proposed. So, the "freeze" he proposed each year was on the higher amount adopted by the board, not the lower amount that he had proposed and tried to preserve with his vetoes. This was the same pattern Walker followed as county executive. Our rating Abele says he balanced the Milwaukee County budget "without raising taxes five years in a row." That claim has the ring of finality to it, as though Abele has presided over five budgets without a tax increase. In reality, Abele did propose a freeze in the property tax levy each year and he issued budget vetoes that would have kept the levy down. But the County Board ultimately adopted a budget that raised the total property tax take in four of the five years, and Abele took advantage of those actions when he proposed a freeze the following year. So, taxpayers are paying more than when he took office. For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True. More on Milwaukee County Edward Flynn: In Milwaukee County, juveniles arrested for car theft "get sent immediately home, because under the point system in juvenile court" on holding suspects, "a stolen car gets zero points."

pomt-09917	ACORN will be a paid partner with the Census Bureau and "they will be in charge of going door-to-door and collecting data from the American public."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jun/26/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-claims-acorn-getting-money-work-c/	Rep. Michele Bachmann sparked a new controversy recently when she declared she would provide the bare minimum to Census takers because she was concerned about the Census Bureau's partnership with ACORN, a left-leaning group that has become a popular villain for Republicans. (You remember ACORN: Formally known as the Association of Community Organization for Reform Now, it was lambasted in 2008 by many Republicans because its voter registration efforts included some fraudulent names such as Mickey Mouse. ACORN leaders said they discovered the fake names, notified authorities and fired some workers who cut corners. But Republican leaders still say it was a willful effort to manipulate the election to help the group's liberal agenda.) Here's how Bachmann explained her concerns in a Washington Times interview (which you can listen to here ): "Now ACORN has been named one of the national partners, which will be a recipient again of federal money," Bachmann said. "And they will be in charge of going door-to-door and collecting data from the American public. This is very concerning because the motherload of all data information will be from the Census. And, of course, we think of the Census as just counting how many people live in your home. Unfortunately, the Census data has become very intricate, very personal (with) a lot of the questions that are asked. "And I know for my family the only question that we will be answering is how many people are in our home. We won't be answering any information beyond that, because the Constitution doesn't require any information beyond that." Bachmann packs a lot of bad information into a short space there. So in this item we'll deal with her latest claim about ACORN, and we'll deal with her claim about the constitutional requirement with a different item . She is wildly wrong with her chraracterization of the Census Bureau's partnership program. Yes, the bureau does partner with organizations to help recruit workers. To date, it has 30,000 such partners. ACORN is one. Partners agree "to promote the 2010 Census among their constituents." As a partner, ACORN has agreed to spread the word among its people about the availability of temporary Census jobs. The U.S. Census Bureau expects to hire 1.4 million people through the course of the 2010 census, the bulk of them to do the door-to-door questionnaires, so the bureau casts a wide net to get applicants, including through its partners. Partners don't get paid, but they presumably benefit by getting the word out to members about jobs, and also by providing a public service emphasizing the importance of filling out the Census. According to Census Bureau information provided to Congress on June 1, 2009, "ACORN and other partner organizations simply promote the availability of temporary Census jobs, but have no role in the terms or conditions of employment beyond promotion of the availability of temporary jobs. Applicants that are hired by the Census Bureau to work on the 2010 Census are required to go through a background check that includes an FBI name check and fingerprint check so that felons are not hired to work on the 2010 Census." Partners are also encouraged to donate testing space for the millions of people who will apply for the temporary Census jobs. No payments are made for that. And lastly, partners are asked to promote full participation in the Census among their members, through newsletters, e-mails, local meetings etc. Again, there's no payment for that. So let's count the ways Bachmann is wrong: ACORN will not be "in charge" of going door-to-door and collecting data from the American public, as Bachmann said. The U.S. Census will be in charge of that. Some of the 1.4 million people who get Census-taking jobs may learn about the job through ACORN. Workers who apply to the Census through ACORN have no better shot at the job than those who apply through any of the 30,000 other partners. That's it. And despite Bachmann's claim, ACORN gets no money for signing on as a partner. Once again, she is making a scaremongering claim about ACORN with facts that are ridiculously wrong. So we have to set the meter on fire once again. She earns another Pants on Fire.	None	Michele Bachmann	None	None	None	2009-06-26T15:34:17	2009-06-17	['United_States']
pomt-00043	Says New York Rep. John Faso "cast the deciding vote" to try to kill health care protections provided by Obamacare.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/nov/05/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/whos-blame-almost-killing-obamacare-democrats-poin/	In 2017, as Republicans considered measures to repeal and replace Obamacare, the House Budget Committee took an important preliminary vote. It decided 19 to 17 to advance the American Health Care Act. That means, the Democratic Party says, that Rep. John Faso of New York "cast the deciding vote to deny protections for pre-existing conditions." The claim is in a new ad the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee put on the air in the closing days of the race in New York Congressional District 19 south of Albany, where Faso faces a challenge from Antonio Delgado. Faso, the DCCC says, could have stopped the whole bill, one that critics say could have been deeply harmful to people who need the protections the Affordable Care Act provides. It only failed later because the Senate lacked the support for its version. Was Faso the deciding vote? Let’s look at the math. Budget committee vote The committee vote on March 16, 2017, was 19-17. That means it passed by two votes. But if just one lawmaker who voted yes had voted no instead, the count would have been 18-18, a tie. "It fails if it is a tie," DCCC spokesman Evan Lukaske told us. And that could have stopped everything that followed, he said. Couldn’t any of the others have done the same thing? How can you say one member was the deciding vote? The DCCC allows that any member might have made a difference, but it doesn’t mean Faso couldn’t have been the key. Three other Republicans had voted no because they thought the bill didn’t do enough to kill the health program. Regardless of reasons, Faso could have joined them. "He could have made the decision to kill it," Lukaske said. In fact, the Times Herald-Record, a newspaper covering the Hudson Valley region, had a front page with Faso’s picture and the headline, "Deciding vote," with a story saying the congressman kept the "controversial health care bill alive." The front page is shown in the DCCC ad. The bill’s problems The committee vote was to move the bill along, a necessary step for putting the bill on the House floor. But Republican leaders including Speaker Paul Ryan acknowledged it would need changes to win full House approval. When the Budget Committee voted, the bill had provisions calling for reducing Medicaid payments to states. It had language eliminating penalties for people who refused to buy health insurance. It called for changing the subsidy system for those buying coverage. And it would have relaxed the rule that said insurers could charge their oldest customers no more than three times the premiums they charged their youngest ones. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the bill, as it existed at that point, would have led to 14 million more people being uninsured in 2018, a figure rising to 21 million in 2020 and 24 million in 2026. Democrats and health policy groups warned that if states got less money for Medicaid, they would pare back their programs, inevitably leaving some people with fewer medical services or more hurdles for enrollment. They said older customers with private insurance would face price hikes, and the subsidies to help pay would be inadequate. Republicans supporting the bill pointed out that it included money to help states stabilize their insurance markets. The CBO said states would probably use those grants "to limit the costs to insurers of enrollees with very high claims." At this point, would the bill have killed protections for pre-existing conditions, as the DCCC claims? The answer is indirectly, it could have weakened protections -- but the question is academic because the House made changes to the bill before its May 2017 passage. One included an amendment allowing states to seek waivers from other ACA rules, including one that health policy groups said would have eroded requirements for providing medical services for patients who need them the most. This could lead to a new round of debate on that final House bill, but we have covered that repeatedly and the point here is different: The DCCC says Faso could have stopped everything with his committee vote. Our ruling The DCCC says John Faso "cast the deciding vote to deny protections for preexisting conditions." Before we rule, it’s important to note that states had their own insurance rules before the ACA. New York already prohibited charging higher premiums based on health status. PolitiFact looked at this more fully when examining a related claim about Faso. We are interested here in whether Faso was the deciding vote -- whether, as the ad suggests, he could have stopped it all. We need not go far to decide, because the same kind of claim was used by Republicans against Democrats in past elections, when Republicans blasted Democrats for passing the ACA in the first place. They noted how a procedural motion needed for the bill passed by a single vote. Here were some of those claims: Bill Nelson "the deciding vote" on the health care law (2012) Warner cast "the tiebreaking vote" on Obamacare (2013) Mark Udall 'passed Obamacare with his vote' (2014) Russ Feingold cast deciding vote on Obamacare (2015) There’s more, but you get the gist. Faso was one of 19 House Budget Committee members who voted for the early version of the House repeal-and-replace bill last year. Had he voted no, things might have changed. But the same can be said for 18 others. To point out Faso as the singular villain or hero way overstates his role. Just as we did repeatedly on the ACA claim, we rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-03102	"You have to get a license to fish on our beaches."	true	/florida/statements/2013/sep/23/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-you-need-license-fish-beach-really/	Indulge us this fantasy: Beckoned by summer’s end, you escape work early and head for the sandy shores of your favorite Florida beach. It’s fishing time! As you stand near gentle waves, fishing rod in hand, an authority figure approaches with a buzzkill of a question: Where’s your license, pal? My what? Yep, there’s really a requirement for a saltwater shoreline fishing license under state law. We were as surprised to hear about it as Gov. Rick Scott during his recent "listening tour" for tax and fee cuts around the state. "You have to get a license to fish on our beaches. I didn't know that," Scott told health care workers in Tampa on Sept. 18. "We're going to get rid of that." Good news for amateur anglers: It’s free to state residents (not counting convenience fees for ordering by phone or Internet). So repealing it is a freebie for Scott’s promise to cut $500 million in taxes and fees. Florida used to have no such requirement, but the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission requested it during the 2009 legislative session. Otherwise, a federal registration requirement carrying a $15-$25 fee would have gone into effect in 2011, according to a Q&A about the license. "I think it’s important for people to realize that fish and wildlife resources belong to everyone," said FWC spokesman Gary Morse. "One of the most important reasons that we have to have the license is for the ability to manage our fisheries. We need to know how much pressure is being put on the fishery for both commercial (purposes) and recreation." With more information in hand, officials can make better decisions about fishing rules and regulations, he said. Popped for fishing on the beach without a license? Officials generally issue a warning -- the first time, Morse said. After that there could be fines. The shoreline license only covers people fishing from land or a structure attached to land, not someone fishing from a boat or a shore reached by boat. Wading into the water is okay, as long as you can stand on the bottom. You don’t have to have the free version if you already possess a saltwater fishing license (annual license starts at $17) or if you are under age 16 or a senior resident. There’s an exemption from the shoreline license for people approved for food stamps, temporary cash assistance or Medicaid by the Department of Children and Families. Actually, there are a lot of regulations and exemptions with all fishing licenses, and you can read more about them from FWC here. (If you want to avoid registration altogether, the state offers two upcoming license-free saltwater fishing days on Oct. 12 and Nov. 30.) Scott may have said he wants to get rid of the requirement, but his press office said there are no plans to formally propose a repeal. As for his statement about needing a license to fish on the beach, we found nothing fishy about it. We rate his claim True.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2013-09-23T10:27:49	2013-09-18	['None']
pomt-15177	Says "there’s 400,000" anchor babies born in the United States a year, which are "individuals coming to our country and having their children so their children can be U.S. citizens."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/23/corey-lewandowski/donald-trumps-campaign-manager-says-there-are-4000/	Donald Trump’s proposal to end automatic citizenship for the U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants spurred a week of talk about "anchor babies," a term that some say is derogatory. Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski tried to clarify his boss' views on CNN’s State of the Union on Aug. 23, 2015. "If you think of the term ‘anchor baby,’ which is those individuals coming to our country and having their children so their children can be U.S. citizens," Lewandowski said on Aug. 23. "There’s 400,000 of those taking place on a yearly basis. To put this in perspective, that’s equivalent of the population of Tulsa, Okla." We wondered whether there really were 400,000 "anchor babies" born in the United States every year (and yes, that is the population size of Tulsa). Are the undocumented mothers specifically coming here to give birth in hopes of some kind of legal status? We didn’t hear back from Lewandowski or the Trump campaign. We did, however, find the number in congressional testimony from the Center for Immigration Studies, a research organization that supports lower immigration levels. "Every year, 350,000 to 400,000 children are born to illegal immigrants in the United States," the center’s Jon Feere said on April 29, 2015. "To put it another way, as many as one out of 10 births in the United States is now to an illegal immigrant mother." Those figures may have been accurate several years ago, but they are outdated when compared to current estimates, said Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer with the Pew Research Center. Passel is the author of a widely cited 2010 Pew Hispanic Center report that pins the number of children born to undocumented immigrants at 340,000 in 2008 (about 8 percent of all births that year). "Figures as high as 400,000 per year are plausible for the mid 2000s, but our current estimates are around 300,000 per year," he told us. "The numbers were higher in the mid 2000s than now — in part because there were more unauthorized immigrants then and overall birth rates, for natives and immigrants alike, were higher before the recession." So Lewandowski’s number is slightly exaggerated. His characterization of these births as "anchor babies" is also problematic, however, as the metaphor implies intent that the numbers don’t back up. Based on past reporting, it’s not clear whether every birth to an undocumented mother was for the purpose of tethering the family to American soil. "There are a million hardworking Hispanic people in San Diego who came here to work and then happened to have a baby," midwife Lauren Weber said in the 2010 fact-check. "Then, there are people who come over in order to have a baby." Weber also described a practice known as "birth tourism," in which middle- and upper-class visitors on tourist visas travel to the United States specifically to have a baby. The numbers for these types of births are much lower, at around 8,600, or 0.2 percent of all births, in 2013, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As for undocummented immigrants, experts don't think they have the same motivations. "I believe that most migrants come for economic reasons and opportunity," said Theresa Brown, the director of immigration policy at the Bipartisan Policy Institute. "The idea that their child may be able to sponsor them for a green card in 21 years is probably too long term to be a primary driver of immigration." Roberto Suro, a communications and journalism professor at the University of Southern California who specializes in Hispanic issues, had also pointed that if undocumented immigration was spurred by "anchor babies," more undocumented immigrants would be women of childbearing age. The data shows the exact opposite: Adult immigrant men vastly outnumber women. Our ruling Lewandowski said that 400,000 "anchor babies" are born in the U.S. every year. The claim is not as straight-forward as it seems. First, the figure is outdated — a more accurate number for the amount of births to undocumented immigrants is 300,000. Lewandowski also makes a blanket statement when he says all of these births occurred specifically to anchor the undocumented families to the United States. While the practice occurs, it’s not safe to draw a single broad conclusion from the data and apply it to the intentions of every pregnant undocumented woman. We rate his claim Mostly False.

pomt-04736	Says that as Providence’s mayor, David Cicilline said the city had a "world-class … school system. Not only did Providence not have a world-class school system but as measured, was amongst the last school system in the entire country."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/aug/30/anthony-gemma/anthony-gemma-says-when-us-rep-david-cicilline-was/	In between leveling charges Tuesday night that U.S. Rep. David Cicilline was a liar and had committed voter fraud -- charges that Cicilline strenuously denied -- challenger Anthony Gemma claimed that the first-term congressman’s "number one lie" pertained to the condition of Providence’s schools while Cicilline was mayor. During their first television debate in the 2012 primary race, broadcast on WPRI-Channel 12, Gemma said Cicilline had described the capital city’s school system during his eight years as mayor in glowing terms when that was far from the truth. "When Mr. Cicilline was mayor of Providence -- we’re going to stumble on the number one lie of Mr. Cicilline during his tenure as mayor --what he said is that the City of Providence during his eight years had a world-class -- and he used the word world-class -- school system. And not only did Providence not have a world-class school system but, as measured, was amongst the last school system [sic] in the entire country." We knew that the city’s schools -- like those in many urban centers -- have problems and are among the most troubled in Rhode Island. But we wondered whether they are among the worst in the entire country. We called the Gemma campaign to get the candidate’s supporting evidence and, while we waited for a response, started doing our own research. At no time in American history are students and their schools more tested and ranked than today. With every changing season, it seems, comes another report evaluating their educational progress and slippage. There are tests that can be used to compare schools within the same district and school districts within each state. There is even the rare instance of one state’s schools ranked against another state's. But we could not find one ranking that measured Providence’s school system against other city systems around the country, as Gemma claimed, let alone that ranked it so poorly. We called the state Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, and Rhode Island KIDS COUNT, a statewide children’s policy organization. Neither knew of any national test rankings that ever compared the performance of Providence’s school system with, for example, Los Angeles or Cincinnati. Terris Ross, a research scientist at The National Center for Education Statistics, an arm of the U.S. Department of Education, said the center does compile an annual list of statistics on the nation’s 100 largest school districts. But it does not rank or compare school districts by achievement or performance. Locally, Providence’s schools rank among the worst in Rhode Island. According to data by Rhode Island KIDS COUNT, 65 percent of Providence’s public schools made "insufficient progress" in 2008 while Cicilline was serving the third of his four terms as mayor. But what Gemma’s campaign spokesman supplied as evidence supporting the candidate’s remarks was way off the mark. In an e-mail, Alex Morash said Gemma’s claims were based on low marks given in several studies to "Rhode Island and/or Providence schools. " But how Rhode Island schools fared is not at issue here at all. Gemma specifically criticized Cicilline for the low marks Providence schools allegedly received while Cicilline was mayor. And none of the studies his campaign provided links to specifically ranked Providence against other cities in the nation. Further, the only reference the Gemma campaign provided of Cicilline using the phrase "world class" was a speech Cicilline gave at a school in Cumberland talking about the importance of students -- in general -- receiving a "world- class" education. Cicilline was using the phrase as a goal to shoot for -- not, as Gemma claimed, to describe Providence’s schools. Our ruling Anthony Gemma, who is challenging David Cicilline in the Democratic primary for Rhode Island’s 1st District congressional seat, said the former Providence mayor had described the capital city’s school system as world class when, in fact, "not only did Providence not have a world-class school system but as measured, was amongst the last school system in the entire country." We’ve already cited why Gemma was wrong about the "world-class" remark. Concerning the schools, neither state nor federal education officials know of any national school-district ranking that would have placed the city’s school system among the worst in the country. And Gemma didn’t provide any. For those reasons, we rate his statement a world-class False.	None	Anthony Gemma	None	None	None	2012-08-30T00:03:00	2012-08-28	['None']
pomt-11738	"Breaking: woman says she was offered big money by Washington Post to accuse Roy Moore of misconduct."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/dec/11/evening-world/fake-news-about-washington-post-and-roy-moore-accu/	A fake news story said a Washington Post reporter offered a woman money if she would accuse Alabama U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore of a crime. "Breaking: Woman says she was offered big money by Washington Post to accuse Roy Moore of misconduct," stated a Nov. 13 headline in Evening World, which is similar to an earlier story by The Gateway Pundit, a website that posts some fake news. The Washington Post reported in November that Moore, while in his 30s, initiated sexual encounters with several teenagers, according to the women interviewed by the newspaper. The allegations have become the hot topic in his Dec. 12 race against Democrat Doug Jones. Facebook users flagged the Evening World story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The article is based on a since-deleted twitter account and is fake. The website based the claim that a Post reporter offered money to a woman by citing the Twitter account of @umpire43 who identified himself as Doug Lewis #MAGA. "A family friend who lives in Alabama just told my wife that a WAPO reporter named Beth offered her 1000$ to accuse Roy Moore????," Lewis tweeted Nov. 10. One of the Post reporters who wrote about Moore was Beth Reinhard. Lewis also tweeted that the family friend had photographs of the reporter and had recorded the telephone conversation. He directed her to bring that information to her local district attorney’s office. Lewis wrote that "Jean" provided evidence to the Etowah County District Attorney in Alabama. Multiple news outlets including The Daily Beast, the Post and Snopes reported in November that @umpire43 had since deleted his account. The account user had a history of perpetuating hoaxes. The Daily Beast reported that the author of the account had repeatedly invented stories about his own background claiming to be a Navy veteran, a pollster, a baseball umpire, an expert on rigged voting machines, an American consulate worker in Calgary and "a beleaguered soul who needed time off after the 9/11 attacks when he saw Muslims ‘dancing on rooftops.’ " The Daily Beast contacted all of his alleged employers and affiliates and found that he hadn’t held any of the positions. The Twitter account launched in 2011 peaked at around 18,000 followers by the time that the Gateway Pundit reported on his claim against the Post. Tweets from @umpire43 had drawn attention from InfoWars and other right-wing sources. The Gateway Pundit added a an update at the bottom of its story about @umpire43’s tweets: "We have not been able to confirm these allegations by Doug Lewis." Reinhard, the Post reporter targeted in the fake news story, directed PolitiFact to a spokeswoman for the Post, Shani George. "The accusation against the Post is categorically false," George told PolitiFact in an email. "We have an explicit policy that prohibits paying sources." We found no contact information or disclaimer on the Evening World’s website, eveningw.com. The pro-Donald Trump website lifts accounts from other conservative websites. (The Evening World was an actual newspaper that published in New York City from 1887-1931). There is no evidence that a Post reporter offered a woman money to make an accusation against Moore.

Its claims were deemed "absurd" by the National Hurricane Center. With a headline "12 More Hurricanes Headed Towards US," the post was published on react365.com and alleged to be sourced to the National Hurricane Center. "The National Hurricane Center has issued 12 more hurricane warnings for the East Coast of the U.S.," read the post, "‘Regardless of which coast you live on, be prepared to evacuate at least 12 times, the National Weather Services said Thursday, not ruling out the possibility of a 13th hurricane by the end of the year." Despite the assumed validity of the sources, the entirety of this post is false. PolitiFact has written about similar "prank" posts in the past. This post and React365.com are part of a social media trend that allows people to create bogus news articles and publish them as if they are true. These so-called prank posts can leave users vulnerable to "like-farming," where scammers use click-bait posts to get as many likes as possible and spread malware through popularly clicked links. We first saw the post on Sept. 21, 2017, but it appears to have been updated by the publisher to look more current. The content of the post hasn’t changed. Since we first saw the post, there have been only three hurricanes in the Atlantic: Jose, Maria and Lee. Jose, which was quickly downgraded to a tropical storm when it came close to the East Coast, has fallen off the National Hurricane Center radar since Sept. 22. Maria has moved north off the shores of North Carolina and is predicted to move northeast, farther away from the East Coast. And Lee remains a idle swirl in the middle of the Atlantic with no apparent intent to touch American shores. The National Hurricane Center has yet to issue anything more severe than a tropical storm warning for any of these storms. Though the post is false, Dennis Feltgen of the National Hurricane Center advises people to stay vigilant during this active hurricane season. Since May, the National Weather Service has forecast that this year’s Atlantic hurricane season would be more active than past seasons. On Aug. 9, they updated their forecast, stating that this may be the most active hurricane season since 2010. But, in the eyes of the National Hurricane Center, the react365.com claim is still nothing more than fake news and, according to Feltgen, "totally unfounded, totally baseless and totally irresponsible."

pomt-07180	Out of 150,000 tenured teachers in the last 10 years, only 17 have been dismissed for incompetence.	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jun/10/chris-christie/gov-chris-christie-claims-only-17-150000-tenured-n/	In his ongoing attempts at education reform in New Jersey, Gov. Chris Christie has a statistic to prove his point that tenure in the public school system provides a "job for life": only 17 out of 150,000 tenured teachers have been dismissed for incompetence during the past decade. The Republican governor offered those figures during his April 29 address before about 250 students and professors at Harvard University's Graduate School of Education. Here’s what Christie told the Ivy League institution: "In New Jersey, despite whatever the union will tell you, tenure is a job for life after three years and one day. It is a job for life. Here’s the evidence of it. We have about 150,000 public school teachers in New Jersey. In the last ten years how many teachers do you believe were dismissed for incompetence who were tenured teachers? Now keep it in context. Ten years at 150,000, 1.5M (1.5 million) opportunities to do this in the last ten years. The answer is seventeen. Seventeen in ten years." PolitiFact New Jersey was intrigued by the low number, and we reached out to the governor’s office and the state Department of Education to check it. The governor’s representatives could not prove there have been 150,000 tenured teachers during the past decade, but state records mostly support Christie’s argument that only 17 teachers were removed from the classroom following charges of "inefficiency" or "incompetence" during the past 10 years. First, let’s talk about that bigger number -- 150,000 tenured teachers? According to the New Jersey Department of Education’s website, the number of certified teachers climbed from 102,723 in the 2001-02 school year to about 114,704 in the 2009-10 school year. Those figures likely include nontenured teachers. PolitiFact New Jersey submitted an open public records request seeking, in part, documents detailing the number of tenured teachers in the public school system from 2000 to 2011, but state education officials told us they don’t have any such records. We reached out to the governor’s office for an explanation of the 150,000 figure, but two phone messages were never returned. Now, let’s return to those 17 dismissals cited by Christie at Harvard. Through the same open public records request, state education officials provided records of 17 cases from between 2001 and 2010 where tenured individuals were dismissed or resigned from their jobs following charges of inefficiency or incompetence. Christie had used the word "incompetence," but education spokesman Alan Guenther told us the correct term is "inefficiency," which covers incompetence. The cases typically involve teachers failing to provide adequate instruction for students. PolitiFact New Jersey found a few discrepancies between Christie’s statement and the records provided by the education department. Christie said 17 teachers were dismissed, but the records show that nine individuals resigned through settlement agreements and another person resigned before an agreement was reached. The remaining seven individuals were dismissed from their positions by the commissioner or acting commissioner of education. Also, the 17 individuals include a social worker, a facilities manager and a secretary. We also conducted our own review of more than 140 legal decisions available on the Department of Education’s website involving tenure hearings during the past decade. That research turned up only two cases ending in teacher dismissals between 2001 and 2010 involving inefficiency charges that were not included in the records provided by the education department. Excluding cases involving inefficiency or incompetence, 64 staff members in public schools were dismissed between 2001 and 2010 for other tenure charges, such as unbecoming conduct, according to decisions on the department’s website. Another eight individuals lost their jobs by other means in the face of tenure charges. Here’s where all that research leaves us: If we include the case involving the social worker, our research and the records provided to us support Christie’s statement that 17 teachers left their jobs following charges of inefficiency or incompetence. A New Jersey Education Association spokesman and a Rutgers professor took exception to Christie’s figure. NJEA spokesman Steve Baker pointed to state data showing that, on average, nearly 40 percent of first-year certified staff members in New Jersey do not attain tenure. By the time individuals attain tenure, they have proven to be competent teachers, Baker said. "Because they are essentially at-will employees for three years, there is no way to know why each one left or was not brought back. However, it is clear that a large number were dismissed, or chose to leave, because they were not effective," Baker wrote in an email. "Those who make it through the process and earn tenure have already pretty convincingly demonstrated to their administrators that they are effective and capable." Bruce Baker, an associate professor in the Graduate School of Education at Rutgers University, who is not related to Steve Baker, said the 17 figure is not very meaningful because teachers are dismissed before reaching tenure status or they’re forced out later without charges being filed. There also is no benchmark of how many bad teachers are out there, Baker said. Two experts said proving charges of inefficiency and incompetence presents a challenge to school districts. The existing evaluation system makes it difficult to determine ineffectiveness among tenured teachers, said Patrick McGuinn, an associate professor of political science at Drew University. The cost and time involved in pursuing such tenure cases also are disincentives for districts, he said. Middlesex County attorney David Rubin, who represents various school districts, added: "What constitutes lousy teaching is somewhat subjective to begin with." Let’s return to Christie’s statement: The governor said 17 out of 150,000 tenured teachers were dismissed for incompetence in the last 10 years. The 150,000 figure is off, since state records show no more than 114,704 certified teachers have been working in the past decade. But state records back up his statement about the 17 cases involving inefficiency or incompetence charges. Still, his underlying point is largely correct. The state has tens of thousands of teachers and only 17 have lost their jobs through dismissals or resignations in the past decade following charges of incompetence or inefficiency. We rate his statement Mostly True. To comment on this ruling, join the conversation at www.NJ.com.	None	Chris Christie	None	None	None	2011-06-10T05:02:00	2011-04-29	['None']
pomt-07052	Says he can’t release his internal affairs record because there are Attorney General guidelines in place protecting it.	false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jun/30/samuel-demaio/acting-newark-police-director-samuel-demaio-says-h/	Acting Newark Police Director Samuel DeMaio has set many precedents during his tenure with the Newark Police Department. But there is one distinction he doesn’t want: "to be the first cop in the state of New Jersey" to release his internal affairs record. During a recent interview on FOX 5’s "Good Day New York" program, a reporter said to DeMaio, "The city council president, Donald Payne Jr., has really been pressing. He wants to see your internal affairs record. He believes there have been infractions in the past, committed by you. He wants to see your record. Why not release it to him?" "It's really that I can't," DeMaio replied. "There are Attorney General guidelines in place that protect it because of what's in those records. It's any allegation ... what I can say is there’s no sustained complaints on my record. I don't want to be the first cop in the state of New Jersey to set that precedent. It’s just not an issue." PolitiFact New Jersey learned there are guidelines covering different files kept on police officers, and there are strict protections on internal affairs files to maintain their confidentiality. But there are exceptions -- one of which would allow the release of DeMaio’s internal affairs file. First, let’s explain why DeMaio is being asked to release his records. DeMaio was appointed acting top cop in Newark days before the U.S. Justice Department announced an investigation into the Newark Police Department. The American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey last year petitioned the federal government to investigate alleged civil-rights abuses by the department. When the previous police director, Garry McCarthy, announced his departure, ACLU-NJ Executive Director Deborah Jacobs asked Newark Mayor Cory Booker to require any internal candidate for the position to "voluntarily disclose to the public their work assignment history and their internal affairs/disciplinary history." After DeMaio’s appointment was announced, Jacobs wrote in a May 10 opinion-editorial piece, "For DeMaio, the need for transparency is especially pressing," citing a 2007 incident when DeMaio was reprimanded by the state Attorney General’s Office for questioning a witness about his immigration status, as well as other concerns about DeMaio’s reputation in the community. In Jacobs’ op-ed, she referred to the files she wants released as both internal affairs records and disciplinary records. City council members and a group of Newark pastors have also called for DeMaio to release his file, which they often refer to as his disciplinary record. But a disciplinary record is generally not maintained as a separate file. The state Attorney General’s Office recommends police departments keep a personnel file, an internal affairs file and a medical file on police officers. A Booker spokeswoman told us the Newark Police Department follows that system. DeMaio correctly stated that state Attorney General guidelines protect internal affairs files. The guidelines state that "the nature and source of internal allegations, the progress of internal affairs investigations, and the resulting materials are confidential information." The guidelines describe several "limited circumstances" under which records from internal affairs investigations can be released, including upon a court order and upon the request of the county prosecutor or Attorney General. But the guidelines also state, "the law enforcement executive officer may authorize access [to] a particular file or record for good cause." The state Attorney General’s Office refused to confirm that the guidelines authorize Newark’s police director to release an internal affairs file. Booker’s spokeswoman said the police director is the "law enforcement executive officer" in the city. She also noted, "it should be pointed out that when they say a ‘particular file’ they mean incident specific." James Drylie, executive director of Kean University’s school of criminal justice, said that while DeMaio has the authority to release his internal affairs file as the "law enforcement executive officer," the state Attorney General guidelines clearly aim to keep those files confidential. The city administration sent this statement when we requested comment from DeMaio: "Acting Police Director DeMaio remains focused on his number one priority - the public safety of our residents and making sure that this summer will be Newark’s safest." Let’s review. DeMaio said he can’t release his internal affairs record because there are state Attorney General guidelines protecting it. The state Attorney General’s guidelines describe an internal affairs file as a confidential document, but also lays out specific exceptions to that policy -- one of which technically allows DeMaio to release his file. We rate DeMaio’s statement False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.	None	Samuel DeMaio	None	None	None	2011-06-30T05:15:00	2011-06-09	['None']
pomt-12848	Obamacare is "hurting people right now" with premium increases of up to 116 percent.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/feb/03/paul-ryan/testing-paul-ryan-claim-obamacare-premium-increase/	U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan has received a lot of criticism (and a False rating from us) for his claims that actuaries say Obamacare is in a "death spiral." But it’s far from his only criticism of the former president’s trademark health care law. Ryan has repeatedly brought up rising premiums as well, notably in his Jan. 5, 2017 weekly briefing where he ran off a list of increases for 2017. "This law is hurting people right now. I mean, look at these premium increases," the Janesville Republican said, then ticked off a series of states. "This year Arizona, 116 percent increase in premiums. Tennessee, 63 percent increase in premiums. Oklahoma, 69 percent increase in premiums. Illinois, 43 percent increase in premiums. North Carolina, 40 percent increase in premiums. Nebraska, 51 percent. Pennsylvania, 53 percent. These aren’t statistics, these are real lives," he said. "These are real families facing huge premium increases." Are the premium increases Ryan cited correct, "hurting people right now" and attributable to Obamacare? Numbers are on the mark The basic numbers are easy to confirm: Those increases are indeed accurate for 2017 compared to 2016 within the Obamacare marketplace. Arizona has by far the largest increase in the nation, and Oklahoma is second. The states all are among the Top 10 in percentage increase over 2016, according to estimates the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released in October 2016. As such, they are not a representative sample of all 50 states, but Ryan never claimed they were. And they are the headlines in a clear national trend. Premiums rose an average of 25 percent across the 39 states that use the HealthCare.gov marketplace. Only one state (Indiana) saw premiums drop in 2017. The calculation is based on the average cost in each county for the second-lowest-cost silver level plan for a 27-year-old, a plan widely used as a benchmark to compare rates between years and geographic areas. Premiums affect many people Ryan’s description of the law as "hurting people right now" is a bit subjective, but it’s clear enough for us to examine since he later expanded on this by referencing "families facing huge premium increases." Obamacare supporters often claim premium increases are irrelevant due to the subsidies built into Obamacare. Those subsidies cap premium prices at a certain percentage of income for anyone below 400% of the federal poverty level (that’s $48,240 in 2017 for a single person). For 2017, 81 percent of consumers enrolled in the marketplace through Dec. 24, 2016 were in line to receive a subsidy. That means 19% of those insured will receive no subsidy and therefore bear the full weight of those premium increases (assuming they stay on the same plan). That’s more than 2 million people, based on the latest enrollment data. Fair to attribute increase to Obamacare? The final hurdle for Ryan’s claim is the matter of blame. He says the law itself is hurting people right now — in other words, that increases due to Obamacare go beyond the general trend of rising health care costs. This year’s 25 percent increase is by far the largest since Obamacare began. Premiums rose around 7 percent in 2016 and 3 percent in 2015, based on the HHS analysis of the same benchmark plan. For starters, that jump is far beyond what is expected industry wide. The National Business Group on Health estimates employees of the nation’s largest businesses — an indicator of overall health insurance costs — will see about a 5 percent premium increase in 2017, based on a survey of 425 large employers. Obamacare premiums are rising far more in part because of several mechanisms built into the healthcare law that have ended or not worked as intended — reinsurance and risk corridors. Both were set up as temporary measures from 2014 to 2016 to subsidize the marketplace, artificially keeping prices low. Reinsurance was designed to reduce the incentive for insurers to charge higher premiums to higher-cost policyholders in the first years of Obamacare, which was accomplished by transferring funds to the plans for those policyholders. Risk corridors were designed to transfer money from profitable insurers to those losing money on the ACA exchange, discourage insurers from setting high premiums due to the uncertainty of the new market. They were originally pitched as a mechanism that would bring in money, then as one that would break even. But the latest data shows in 2015 claims from insurers for payment through the program outweighed the money paid in by $5.8 billion, so the expected funds weren’t available to redistribute. Now that the programs have ended as designed, premiums are rising to more closely match what it actually costs insurers to offer plans in the marketplace. This is by no means an exhaustive accounting of the factors driving 2017 premiums upward. Experts say general growth in health care costs still play a role, as do changes in who is signing up, provider networks and the small group market, among others. Our rating Ryan said soaring Obamacare premiums are "hurting people right now," including one state with an increase of 116 percent. The state-by-state increases he cited were correct based on the commonly used benchmark plan. The increases appear likely to affect several million people since about one-fifth of those enrolled in Obamacare aren’t eligible for subsidies. And while we can’t exactly identify all the factors in the rising premiums, they are clearly going up more than non-Obamacare premiums due in part to how the system was set up. The missing nuance in Ryan’s claim is that it doesn’t acknowledge the millions of people who wouldn’t have any insurance without Obamacare and would presumably end up hurting even more. And we’ll note some level of financial hurt would exist regardless due to ever-rising cost of health care. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, our rating is Mostly True.

pomt-03670	"Odd fact for odd draft: No. 2 overall pick will earn more than the No. 1 pick due to no state tax in Florida. So 2 not so bad."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2013/apr/26/adam-schefter/nfl-reporter-says-no-2-pick-nfl-draft-will-earn-mo/	Don’t get us wrong: We love analyzing tax policy and following legislative gamesmanship as much as the next political junkie. But we like our work even more when we get to pull in sports and pop culture. And when our Twitter feed dangled a widespread claim combining Florida’s income tax (or, lack thereof) and football on the first night of the NFL draft, we could not resist giving it a second look. In a tweet shared by more than 3,600 users, ESPN reporter Adam Schefter wrote: "Odd fact for odd draft: No. 2 overall pick will earn more than the No. 1 pick due to no state tax in Florida. So 2 not so bad." The Kansas City Chiefs had the top pick, and the Jacksonville Jaguars got the second. We wondered if Texas A&M offensive lineman Luke Joeckel, headed for Jacksonville, will really make more after income taxes than the draft’s No. 1 pick, University of Central Michigan offensive lineman Eric Fisher, who is going to Missouri. Twitter helped our mission from the start. A user named @SportsTaxMan, New Jersey-based sports and entertainment accountant Robert Raiola, responded to Schefter’s tweet with even more detail. "Eric Fisher was picked 1st by #Chiefs The #Jaguars, selected Luke Joeckel. Luke will get approx $285K > after tax than 1st pick," he tweeted. How’d he figure that? Reached by phone, Raiola called the instance of the No. 2 pick’s after-tax pay exceeding No. 1 after-tax pay "an anomaly" in this year’s draft. His method involves some eyeballing. Since we don’t know for sure what these players’ salaries and signing bonuses will be, he used last year’s contracts for the top two picks (quarterbacks Andrew Luck and Robert Griffin III, respectively). There isn’t likely to be a big dollar difference between the top two picks in 2013 because of rules regarding rookie contracts that were adopted as part of the NFL’s 2011 Collective Bargaining Agreement. The minimum base salary for a rookie player is $405,000 in 2013, up from $390,000 in 2012. The big money comes in the form of a signing bonus. Counting base pay and a signing bonus in the first year of their deal, Luck received $14.9 million, and Griffin got $14.1 million. Now fast forward to this year. Florida has no state income tax. Missouri has a 6 percent tax on income over $9,000, and Kansas City, Mo., has a 1 percent tax on top of that. So Raiola figures that if Fisher makes $14.9 million, he will pay a little more than $1 million in state and city income taxes -- dropping his pay (pre-federal tax) to about $13.85 million. That’s less than Joeckel’s expected pre-federal tax haul. There is one complicating factor. Professional athletes pay "jock taxes" when they play in certain states and cities on the road. Technically, they’re working in the state in which they are playing when they go on the road, Raiola said. It creates headaches for athletes but isn’t a huge drain given their high incomes, he said. (You can read about how the jock tax got its start, here. It's an interesting story.) He assumes each NFL away game counts for two duty days. Jacksonville has seven preseason and regular season games on its 2013 schedule in states and cities that have a jock tax: the Atlanta Falcons, New York Jets, Oakland Raiders, Denver Broncos, St. Louis Rams, Cleveland Browns and the Indianapolis Colts. Assuming a 7 percent tax rate, jock taxes will cost Joeckel approximately $99,000. (He won’t pay the tax when he plays the Tennessee Titans, Seattle Seahawks or the Houston Texans). After taking out federal, state and local income taxes, Joeckel comes out approximately $285,000 ahead of Fisher, according to Raiola. But Joeckel isn’t even the luckiest top pick in Raiola’s eyes. That distinction goes to defensive end Dion Jordan, who was drafted by the Miami Dolphins after the team traded up to get the No. 3 pick. "The trade to Miami will save him approx $1.7M in state tax in 2013," he tweeted. (That comparison is with the tax situation in Oakland, Calif., because the Oakland Raiders had held the third draft pick.) Now for some caveats. This analysis focuses on income tax. Florida’s overall state and local tax burden, as measured by the Tax Foundation, is a bit higher than Missouri’s, mainly because of property taxes. Using a few cost-of-living calculators, we found Jacksonville is still cheaper to live in than Kansas City. A $500,000 salary goes about $30,000 further in Jacksonville than Kansas City. There’s also no telling if these newly minted millionaires will take any number of actions that would affect their tax bill, including buying a house, socking money away into a 401(k) savings account or any number of credits and deductions they could take. But if we accept that we’re talking approximations -- and if we assume they live in the state they play in -- we found some agreement. "If we just look at the after-tax pay, that comparison is accurate," said Saku Aura, University of Missouri public economics associate professor. "A state without an income tax, like Florida, will be always attractive from a very high-income individual's perspective." Even though Joeckel did not have a choice about moving to Jacksonville, some free agents may consider income tax as a factor in their decision to come to another team. Cornerback Darrelle Revis was traded to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers this week from the New York Jets, a move Raiola thinks will save him roughly $1,435,000 in state income tax. Of course, an income tax levied against an athlete is probably not going to lead to many tears -- from athletes, or the rest of us. "I guess I don’t have that much sympathy given that there are a whole host of people who would like to be in either of their positions," said Kim Rueben, Tax Policy Institute senior fellow. Our ruling ESPN’s Adam Schefter merged the worlds of the NFL and tax policy on the first day of the NFL draft when he said that No. 2 pick Luke Joeckel will take home more pay than No. 1 pick Luke Fisher because Florida has no state tax. When looking at income tax, Schefter is largely right. If the 2013 salaries hold at about their 2012 levels, which is part of new NFL rules, Joeckel is better off financially by being selected No. 2 by a Florida team than being picked No. 1 somewhere else. There are two caveats. First, the salaries of Joeckel and Fisher are not yet officially known. Also, there are some other ways to look at income that could affect the bottom for Joeckel and Fisher -- whether it be sales taxes or property taxes or overall cost-of-living. We rate Schefter’s claim Mostly True.	None	Adam Schefter	None	None	None	2013-04-26T17:37:49	2013-04-25	['None']
pomt-07903	"The New START treaty was passed despite significant concerns among some people in the State and Defense Departments."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2011/feb/02/bill-janis/bill-janis-says-new-start-treaty-was-passed-despit/	Del. Bill Janis, a Republican from Henrico, recently criticized the U.S. Senate’s ratification of the New START nuclear arms treaty with Russia. According to a Senate roll call, the vote in favor of ratification was 71-26, with three senators not voting. Janis, in a Jan. 25 speech on the floor of the House of Delegates, argued the bill was rushed through the "lame duck" session of Congress despite "significant concerns among some people in the State and Defense Departments." His comments came when he was speaking in support of a proposed U.S. constitutional amendment that would give states the collective right to repeal any law or regulation passed by Congress. We wondered about those "significant concerns" Janis cited and looked to see if there was indeed major opposition to the treaty among former diplomats and generals. First, a word about the pact. New START replaces the 1991 START agreement between the United States and Soviet Union. START stands for Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. The latest agreement was signed in 2010 by President Barack Obama and Russian President Dimitry Medvedev. The treaty limits each nation to 1,550 nuclear warheads, 74 percent lower than the 1991 treaty’s limits. It also contains agreements for each nation to inspect the other’s weapons facilities and exchange missile telemetry. The treaty is set to run for 10 years, with the possibility of being extended for another five years. When we called Janis, he said his comment was based on news reports saying senators and some former members of the diplomatic corps had concerns about the treaty. "I saw media reporting where former secretaries of state had concerns," he told us. There are nine living people who have served as Secretary of State: Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, James Baker, Lawrence Eagleburger, Warren Christopher, Madeleine Albright, Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice and Hillary Clinton. Clinton, the current secretary of state, has backed the treaty in repeated public statements and praised its eventual ratification. Kissinger, Shultz, Baker, Eagleburger and Powell, all of whom served Republican presidents, endorsed the treaty in a Dec. 2, 2010 editorial in The Washington Post. Condoleezza Rice, who served under Republican George W. Bush, backed the treaty in a Dec. 7, 2010 editorial in The Wall Street Journal, though she noted her endorsement carried caveats. She said approval should be accompanied by spending to modernize the U.S. nuclear arsenal and that the treaty should not establish a link between offensive weapons and missile defense systems. Madeleine Albright backed the treaty in a separate editorial in The Washington Post. And Warren Christopher’s support was noted in a November statement released by the office of Vice President Joe Biden. That means every living secretary of state endorsed the treaty. What about at the Defense Department? When the agreement was announced in March 2010, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said the treaty would "strengthen nuclear stability" and that he would work with Congress to ensure ratification. Admiral Michael Mullen, Chairman of the Join Chiefs of Staff, said "I, the Vice Chairman, and the Joint Chiefs, as well as our combatant commanders around the world, stand solidly behind this new treaty, having had the opportunity to provide our counsel, to make our recommendations, and to help shape the final agreements." But what about opposition from former members of the military or diplomatic corps? After some searching we found that John Bolton, who served as Bush’s ambassador to the United Nations, argued against ratifying the treaty. Bolton, writing with former Bush Justice Department official John Yoo, argued "New Start’s faults are legion. The low limits it would place on nuclear warheads ignore the enormous disparities between American and Russian global responsibilities and the importance of America’s 'nuclear umbrella' in maintaining international security." The men also argued that the treaty would also hinder efforts by the United States to use conventional warheads in future conflicts. We also found a joint letter opposing the treaty that included the signatures of Bolton; retired Admiral James Lyons, Jr.; retired Major Gen. Paul Vallely; retired Brig Gen. Jimmy Cash; Paula DeSutter, a former Assistant Secretary of State for Verification, Compliance, and Implementation; Fred Iklé, a former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy and Bruce Gelb, the former ambassador to Belgium. Let’s review the evidence. In our follow-up interview, Janis said he made his comments to show that the treaty "was not without controversy." He also says he thinks the treaty was "rushed through the ‘lame duck’ Congress." Janis has a point about the controversy; the New START treaty had more opposition in the Senate than its two predecessors. The Senate approved the New START treaty on a 71-26 vote. Only four senators opposed START II in 1996, and just six were against the original START treaty in 1992. But he got it wrong when he said there was opposition from former secretaries of state or top brass in the United States military. And the only truly notable former diplomat we found who opposed the treaty was John Bolton. Other opponents of the treaty existed, but their combined stature is a far cry from the roster of every living secretary of state. While trying to make a point about the sometimes-contentious treaty debate, Janis exceeded the facts. The treaty was backed by virtually every top official, past and present, at both the State Department and Defense Department. Therefore we find his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-08714	"Both the state and federal governments make more per gallon in gas taxes than the oil companies make themselves for doing all the work."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2010/sep/03/ron-johnson/ron-johnson-says-gas-taxes-exceed-oil-company-prof/	The BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico was still an accident waiting to happen when Ron Johnson rose to address a political rally last fall, months before he formally entered the U.S. Senate race as a Republican. But the spill would make oil a key issue in many Senate races, including in Johnson’s bid for the seat held by Democratic U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold. And oil company profits have long been a debating point between the parties. In his speech, Johnson spoke in defense of oil industry profits and against candidates who criticize the big oil companies. He said the industry’s success fuels further exploration -- and its stock helps fund the retirement accounts of millions of Americans. "How many times have you heard a politician attack Big Oil and Big Pharma as if these were some kind of evil enterprises preying on our society?" Johnson said at the rally. "Why do they do this? Well, I guess it sounds good to some people, and might help them get elected in some districts. But I can guarantee you, it does nothing to help our country. "I don’t know about you, but I want businesses to succeed ... I want oil companies to make enough money to continue to explore, drill, refine and deliver gas to virtually every corner of America. "Almost everyone's 401(k) or retirement fund owns stock in these companies. And I hope everyone realizes that both the state and federal governments make more per gallon in gas taxes than the oil companies make themselves for doing all the work." So is Johnson on the money regarding the government’s take of gasoline sales? His campaign offers evidence from the American Petroleum Institute, the national trade group representing oil and gas companies. An institute report released in August suggests that, per dollar of sales, gas taxes are more than double the net income earned by the largest oil companies. But Stephen Comstock, API’s manager of tax policy, steered PolitiFact Wisconsin away from the institute’s own per-gallon breakdown. He said it could be confusing and might not be appropriate for assessing the notion that gas taxes exceed profits. Comstock suggested the U.S. Energy Information Administration, a federal agency that compiles tax and revenue data about the biggest oil companies. Their numbers aren’t a perfect fit for the Johnson claim, in part because they include profits from products other than gasoline. But government and private researchers say they are the best available. We found that Johnson’s equation holds up in some years but is off base in others. The reason: Industry profits fluctuate wildly with the price of crude oil. We examined U.S. profits as well as the total net profits including foreign sales. Here’s the scorecard: U.S. profits: Gas taxes topped big oil’s domestic profits in six years out of the last 10, ending in 2008. Foreign and domestic profits: Taxes beat profits twice in 10 years. This comparison, though, leaves out foreign gas taxes. In individual years, the range can be wide. In down years, gas taxes paid by the industry -- and passed along to drivers at the pump -- can exceed even combined US-foreign profits by 100 percent (1999). In boom times, U.S. profits alone can top gas taxes paid by almost 40 percent (2006). A 2010 study by the Tax Foundation, a conservative research organization, went back even further. It found that excise taxes collected from the industry outstripped combined foreign and domestic profits in 12 of the 28 years reviewed. So let’s take stock. Johnson’s timing was good: When he gave his speech, taxes the year before came in higher than U.S. profits by the big companies. That 2008 comparison is the latest available on the federal website. But he didn’t put a time frame on his statement, stating the equation as a timeless fact. And if you include foreign profits, it’s not on target even for 2008. The reality is it depends on the year, which is an important detail. We rate Johnson’s statement Half True.	None	Ron Johnson	None	None	None	2010-09-03T16:11:58	2009-10-10	['None']
pomt-09758	The cap-and-trade bill will mean "2 million jobs lost."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/05/energycitizensorg/claims-cap-and-trade-will-cause-job-losses/	EnergyCitizens.org has a new complaint about the cap-and-trade bill: It's a job killer. In an Oct. 4, 2009, ad in the Washington Post , the group said that "2 million jobs lost" is "another unfortunate truth about Congress's climate bill." The organization, which includes business associations, antitax groups, transportation companies and the American Petroleum Institute, has ramped up criticism of the sweeping cap-and-trade bill since the Senate took up its own version of the legislation in late September. The House has already passed its version of the bill; it aims to lower carbon pollution 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050 by capping carbon emissions and requiring firms to buy credits, either from the government or from other companies, to continue polluting. Opponents of cap-and-trade argue that forcing industry to buy pollution credits will ultimately harm consumers and business. They argue that phasing out fossil fuels will require big job cuts and many employment opportunities will be sent overseas. EnergyCitizens.org is among the critics. The group's ad cites a May 27 study of the House bill written for the National Black Chamber of Commerce, which opposes the bill, by private consulting firm CRA International. The study predicts that net job losses could be as high as 2.5 million by 2030 and 3 million in 2050. CRA International does not dispute the fact that cap-and-trade would create new jobs. But, "despite the promise of green jobs, ACESA would, if enacted, inevitably depress total employment from baseline levels. The bill would divert resources now used to produce additional goods and services into the work of obtaining energy from sources that are more costly than fossil fuels." That outlook doesn't square with what we've been hearing from lawmakers who support a cap-and-trade plan. The backers of the House version say the legislation would create "millions of new clean-energy jobs." The authors of the Senate version say, "This bill includes targeted protection for our manufacturing sector to ensure that American companies remain competitive and jobs remain here at home. New programs will train workers to succeed in the new energy economy. Agriculture and rural America will see a boom in investments in biofuels and alternative energy sources." Both bills include funding for worker training and expanded unemployment benefits; for example, the House bill would provide 156 weeks of benefits, helping to pay for health insurance, job training and employment search assistance to those who lose their jobs as the result of cap-and-trade. But neither House nor Senate lawmakers working on the legislation have pinned down exactly how many jobs their bills would eliminate and create, so we decided to look at other estimates. The Center for American Progress, another liberal group, says the bill could create a net increase of about 1.7 million jobs so long as $150 billion is dedicated to the clean-energy industry every year. "These job gains would be enough — on their own — to reduce the unemployment rate in today’s economy by about one full percentage point, to 8.4 percent from current 9.4 percent levels — even after taking into full account the inevitable job losses in conventional fossil fuel sectors of the U.S. economy as they contract," according to the June 2009 report. And a second analysis done by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a group that is supporting the bill, estimates that the cap-and-trade bill could create anywhere between 600,000 and 1 million new jobs by 2030. Meanwhile, the Congressional Budget Office issued a report in September 2009 that the cap-and-trade plan would have a minor effect on employment in the long-run. "The small effect on overall employment would mask a significant shift in the composition of employment over time," according to the report. "A cap-and-trade program for carbon dioxide emissions would reduce the number of jobs in industries that produce carbon-based energy, use energy intensively in their production processes, or produce products whose use involves energy consumption, because those industries would experience the greatest increases in costs and declines in sales." But "the shifts in demand caused by the policy would also create new employment opportunities in some industries." Stephen Seidel, vice president for policy analysis and general counsel at the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said, "Estimating jobs is a very difficult task for the limited modeling tools that we have." Jobs will almost certainly be lost and created under a cap-and-trade program, it's just a matter to what degree, he said. The CRA International report used in the EnergyCitizens.org ad "falls on the high end." So, back to EnergyCitizens.org's claim that 2 million jobs will be lost under cap-and-trade. As we've shown, the job predictions are all over the map. Supporters of cap-and-trade predict an increase. CRA, which was hired by an opponent of the proposal, says jobs will be lost. The independent CBO characterizes it as a wash. Of all these groups, we're inclined to believe the CBO, since it is independent. But we can't rule out the possibility that there could be gains or losses on either end, as the predictions aligned with supporters and opponents suggest. So we find the ad's claim to be Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-07650	Says that President Obama said in 2008 that his proposed greenhouse gas regulations "will bankrupt" anyone who wants to build a new coal-fired power plant.	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/mar/14/ohio-coal-association/ohio-coal-industry-says-obama-promised-bankrupt-co/	It’s 2008 all over again, based on a claim that recently surfaced from Ohio’s coal industry. That was the year Barack Obama won the presidency. Ten months earlier, the candidate -- a Democratic senator from Illinois who was campaigning for the presidential nomination -- did a wide-ranging, videotaped interview with the San Francisco Chronicle’s editorial board that included his prescription for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Before the campaign would end, his political opponents, including Sarah Palin, discovered the interview on the newspaper’s website and tried to use it against Obama in coal-rich states like Ohio. Maybe you’ve forgotten about it. The coal industry, in a long battle against proposals to cut greenhouse gas emissions by reducing coal use, has not. Mike Carey, president of the Ohio Coal Association, brought up Obama’s statement anew when he testified March 1 to a House subcommittee on energy and power, in advance of a proposed House Republican bill that would strip the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency of its ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. "We absolutely must oppose the new effort by the Obama administration to eliminate coal through the new proposed plant emissions and greenhouse gas regulations," Carey said. "In 2008, President Obama said, ‘If someone wants to build a new coal-fired power plant they can, but it will bankrupt them because they will be charged a huge sum for all the greenhouse gas that’s being emitted.’ " Later in his testimony, Carey added, "Remember what President Obama promised; they will bankrupt anyone who plans to build a coal facility." Did Obama really promise that? It’s a question that matters in states that employ coal miners and rely on coal-fired electricity, especially as the U.S. EPA under Obama prepares to restrict carbon emissions. During a break in the House hearing, we asked Carey for his source for the quote. Then we went back to the original San Francisco Chronicle interview in its entirety, transcribed the parts in which Obama discussed coal, and examined the context of Obama’s remarks. Obama at the time had proposed an aggressive plan to reduce the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere by attaching a price for emissions. The allowable level of emissions would ratchet down yearly, Obama said, with money raised from this system getting invested in cleaner technologies. This would not only create incentives for reducing carbon emissions, he said, but it would also expand the use of wind and solar power, bio-fuels and, potentially, "clean coal," in which carbon emissions could be captured and sequestered in a way that might do no harm. Such clean coal research is ongoing, with vigorous debate as to whether it will someday be applied on a commercial scale. Obama made clear in the interview that he was not suggesting an end to coal use. Too much of the country already uses it in existing power plants and factories. In a portion of the interview his critics failed to note, he said: "This notion of no coal, I think, is an illusion, because the fact of the matter is that right now, we are getting a lot of our energy from coal, and China is building a coal-fired plant once a week. So what we have to do then is we have to figure out how can we use coal without emitting greenhouse gases and carbon. And how can we sequester that carbon and capture it? If we can't, then we're going to still be working on alternatives." But Obama also made clear that he wanted to transition away from building new coal-fired plants, saying that the price on emissions for building one -- using old technology -- would be prohibitive under his plan. Carey said in his testimony that the Obama administration "promised" a "war on coal," which is a claim we believe goes too far. The Obama administration has unquestionably angered the coal industry with rules or proposals affecting air quality standards, coal ash, renewable energy and the issuance of permits needed for coal mining -- all mentioned by Carey in his testimony. But Obama never declared war, and environmentalists and many others have a very different take on this so-called assault. Yet Obama said exactly what Carey quoted him as saying on a point that is especially current, considering the EPA’s new rules, announced this year. To repeat the then-candidate’s statement: "If someone wants to build a new coal-fired power plant they can, but it will bankrupt them because they will be charged a huge sum for all the greenhouse gas that's being emitted." Why, then, aren’t we rating Carey’s claim True? Two reasons: "President Obama" did not make the statement. Obama the U.S. senator and candidate for president did. And that leads to the second reason. Carey suggests that Obama is carrying out the threat he made in 2008, but the new rules from the EPA are different from the cap-and-trade proposal Obama had in 2008. Candidate Obama’s methods were to be more aggressive. In fact, the EPA has shown some flexibility, agreeing to phase in carbon restrictions on new or expanded plants based on their size. The agency also announced on the same day as Carey testified that it will delay its deadlines for businesses that must report their emissions. Carey quoted Obama accurately but not fully, and the regulations and methods that Obama’s EPA wants -- backed by a U.S. Supreme Court decision saying the agency has to regulate greenhouse gas emissions -- are not the same as the candidate proposed. The quote is right, but given the need for clarification or additional information, we rate Carey’s statement as Mostly True.

pomt-12488	"Ted Nugent killed in hunting accident."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/may/01/blog-posting/reports-about-ted-nugent-dying-or-not-hunting-trip/	A series of Internet posts that claimed outspoken rocker Ted Nugent had been killed in a hunting accident — then was assassinated, then was faking his own death — was all fake news. A fake news story that appeared on multiple disreputable websites on April 28, 2017, carried a headline that read, "Conservative icon Ted Nugent killed in hunting accident." Facebook users reported the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the site’s efforts to keep fake news out of users’ news feeds. The story, which is fake, said Nugent was hunting from a tree stand before dawn somewhere in Montana when he was shot "in the chest by a hunter with a scope nearly a quarter of a mile away who believed he was a brown bear." The unnamed hunter faced manslaughter charges and was being held by state police in Boseman (which is really spelled Bozeman). But that’s not the end of the story, by a long shot. The post originated on April 28 at TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a parody website that has been the source of several fake news stories that we’ve previously checked. TheLastLineOfDefense.org fabricates posts keyed to topics designed to inflame conservatives. The articles quite often end up being passed around on multiple websites, often without an indication that they are fake. TheLastLineOfDefense.org doesn’t immediately indicate that any of its stories are fake, but its About Us link notes that "all articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney." In this case, the site followed up its own story with another fake post the same day that said Nugent actually had been killed purposely by a "white sympathizer" named James Alan Whitland, under the alias Alex Hayne. This story also ended up on multiple sites. Whitland, the second post read, had been a teenage hitman for the Black Panthers and had assisted the man who killed five Dallas police officers in 2016. The post said Whitland had been caught by a game warden after Nugent was killed. Nugent and his wife Shermane posted a Facebook Live video the same day he was supposedly shot, confirming that he was alive. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com But there’s more: TheLastLineOfDefense.org then posted a third item, on April 29, saying that Nugent was actually still alive. The third post said Nugent actually had called "local channel WKLU NBC2" (actually an Indianapolis-area radio station) and made up the story and had been "drinking iced tea at the local police station with his accomplices" as the news hit social media. This fake post said two Bozeman police officers had been charged with helping create the hoax and had been "relieved of their duties." Nugent faced a year in jail and more than $1 million in fines over the waste of resources committed to the hoax, the site said, admitting that TheLastLineOfDefense.org had been fooled, too. Of course, this was all fake, because the site is the outlet that made up the stories in the first place. Our contact with the supposed creator of TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a person who says his name is Zeke Wilekenmeyer, did not reply to our email seeking comment on the ruse. Nugent’s assistant, Linda Peterson, did reply to PolitiFact’s questions about the stories, sending a two-word email that read, "Fake news." It’s apparent Nugent was not killed, nor did he perpetrate his own death hoax. The only real news about him recently is his trip to the White House on April 19. We rate the statement Pants On Fire!

pomt-11362	Says Rep. Martha McSally "is a #FlipFlopBorderHawk."	half-true	/arizona/statements/2018/apr/03/kelli-ward/Is-GOP-congresswoman-McSally-a-border-hawk-flip-fl/	U.S. Senate hopeful Kelli Ward called out her Republican opponent as a flip-flopper on a crucial matter to Arizona: border security. "Hey Martha McSally, we could discuss your record a lot easier if you agreed to publicly debate the issues. But since you refuse to, will you at least agree to be honest with the voters? #FlipFlopBorderHawk #TimeToDebate #NoMoreFlakes #AZSEN," Ward said in a March 16 Facebook post. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com The Senate seat is up for grabs as Republican Sen. Jeff Flake’s term comes to an end. Flake isn’t running for re-election. The Republican primary is Aug. 28. Ward, a Republican physician who has served in the state Senate, linked her comment against McSally to a post on Newsmax headlined, "Republicans side with Dems against border wall funding." It cited a joint statement from McSally, a U.S. House member since 2015, and Rep. Will Hurd, R-Texas, acknowledging both the need for border security and for stewardship of taxpayer dollars. Has McSally flip-flopped on her support for the border wall? Ward's campaign pointed to McSally's past reservations on the effectiveness of a 2,000-mile border wall, as well as her initial hesitation to approve money for border barriers requested by President Donald Trump. Yet McSally — who chairs a House subcommittee responsible for oversight of border security programs — ultimately voted to appropriate the funds. Overall, McSally has been neither a fierce critic nor a staunch supporter of the border wall. Ward campaign spotlights McSally’s questions on border wall funding Ward’s team turned the spotlight on a March 15 tweet from McSally that said, "I have always supported building a wall," linking to a Fox News interview in which she decried California’s immigration policies as too lenient. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com But McSally wasn’t always such a fan, Ward's campaign said, pointing to comments about her and that she made in 2017. The Hill in January 2017 reported that Hurd, from Texas, "actively opposes the wall," while McSally and Rep. Steve Pearce, R-N.M., "expressed skepticism" about its effectiveness in stopping illegal immigration. CNN reported on a rowdy town hall in her district the next month and said McSally "made it clear she wasn't sold on Trump's plan to build a border wall." "Not a continuous, 2,000-mile border wall, no," CNN quoted McSally as saying. The Wall Street Journal in April 2017 reported that McSally said walls do little to stop criminal organizations from getting across the border. It cited the McSally-Hurd oversight letter with questions about the request for taxpayer money. (McSally and Hurd are chair and vice-chair, respectively, of the House Committee on Homeland Security’s Border and Maritime Security Subcommittee.) "While we have both publicly stated in the past that we believe physical barriers to be one of many tools required to gain operational control of the border, we also believe that an expenditure this large, and submitted with limited details, deserves additional scrutiny to ensure funds are being used effectively in pursuit of our shared goal of securing the southwest border," their letter said. It listed several questions, including whether the department would consider existing manmade and natural barriers when constructing new barriers. After Trump issued an executive order in January 2017 calling for the border wall and the hiring of an additional 5,000 Border Patrol agents, McSally said it was a "strong start in the right direction." "When it comes to barriers, they are important where appropriate, but only part of the equation. What we need is a comprehensive strategy to grow situational awareness, build operational control, and dismantle the cartels and their networks," she said. In July 2017, McSally voted in favor of a spending bill that included money for border fencing and wall construction planning. But as AZCentral.com noted, McSally praised the bill for what it did for defense, veterans and water, but stopped short of mentioning the border wall. McSally campaign spokeswoman Torunn Sinclair told PolitiFact that McSally is "unequivocally in favor of building a wall," with the addition of technology and agents. McSally has also sponsored and supported several bills to increase border security since joining Congress in 2015, her campaign said. In a November 2017 Fox News interview, McSally said a necessary border strategy is one that "absolutely includes the border wall and physical infrastructure where appropriate." McSally's remarks and actions in 2017 show that while she hasn't been an effusive supporter of the wall, she favors it to an extent. It's worth mentioning that McSally represents a district that voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. Flip-flop or not? Does that mean McSally has flip-flopped on border wall funding? Josiah M. Heyman, an anthropology professor and director of the Center for Interamerican and Border Studies at the University of Texas at El Paso, said he understood Ward’s point given McSally’s 2017 reticence. He noted that an appropriations bill she voted for was for "a very limited version of the wall," and much of it restricted to reworking segments that already exist. The funds also can’t be used to build any of the new wall prototypes, Heyman said. Elizabeth F. Cohen, an associate professor of political science at Syracuse University, said "it is disingenuous to claim that someone who has acted cautiously or recommended scrutiny of border wall plans is either for or against building the wall." "McSally has voted in favor of funding border fencing and wall construction," Cohen said. "Cautious support may in fact ultimately be quite important to the realization of effective border security given that there are many types of border fences and walls that are ineffective or dangerous." Our ruling Ward in a Facebook post called McSally a #FlipFlopBorderHawk. In 2017, McSally publicly questioned a funding request for border barriers — due to limited details — but ultimately voted in favor of it. McSally has said a border wall alone will not stop illegal immigration or criminal organizations, but can work in certain areas. In 2018, McSally has offered a strong embrace, saying she has "always supported building a wall." Ward’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.

It's an extreme charge, since brain death is defined as "irreversible unconciousness with complete loss of brain function" (Encyclopedia of Death and Dying). Needless to say, we find the charge ridiculous. There's no evidence Biden performed the necessary medical tests to make such a diagnosis. We would have accepted the results of a cerebral blood flow study or proof that Biden had examined Bush to see if he had an oculocephalic reflex. Indeed, even people who disagree with the president about Iraq and assorted other issues will acknowledge that the president has spontaneous respiration and is responding to stimuli.

pomt-02313	"Wisconsin wages are declining at double the rate of other states."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2014/mar/31/mary-burke/mary-burke-says-wages-are-declining-wisconsin-doub/	At the center of Mary Burke’s economic critique of the Gov. Scott Walker era is the charge that Wisconsin’s recovery from the Great Recession has lagged behind other states. In her recently unveiled jobs plan, the Democratic candidate for governor marshalled statistics to make a case that progress on jobs and earnings has been lackluster or even nonexistent. One example: "Wisconsin wages are declining at double the rate of other states, and current indicators suggest these trends will continue if we stay on the current path," according to Burke’s plan, which came out March 25, 2014. Are we really losing ground on wages that quickly? We started with the source cited in Burke’s plan: "According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, private-sector wages in Wisconsin fell 2.2% in the 12 months ending September 2012, double the 1.1% decline experienced by the nation overall." Those numbers were familiar to us. They were included in a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story headlined "American workers losing ground on wages." That story ran May 26, 2013, citing the most-recent wage data published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. It showed Wisconsin wages were declining at double the rate of other states. But that was then, and this is now. Newer numbers Wage data for both the state and nation is volatile and fluctuates strongly when measured in increments of 12 months or one quarter. Since those September 2012 figures were released, the BLS has published four quarterly updates. Each update looks at one quarter and compares it with the same quarter a year earlier. (Data notes: There’s a reporting lag of about six months due to the time spent collecting and analyzing the data; the most recent available runs through September 2013. These are averages, so they point to a general trend.) It turns out Burke’s campaign plan selected the worst quarterly wages report during the Walker era and the end of the final term of Gov. Jim Doyle, who left office after 2010. The report she cited ranked Wisconsin at 47th among the states for percent change in average weekly wage (including bonuses) for the one-year period ending in September 2012 quarter. The average wage fell -- losing 2.2 percent in preliminary calculations and 2.3 percent in the final analysis. That was a reduction for workers of $18 a week. But that trend did not hold either in Wisconsin or nationally. Wisconsin’s private-sector wage growth has made a big move in the opposite direction, topping the national average starting with the March 2013 quarterly report. We found: -- For the quarter ending December 2012, the average weekly wage went up (4.9 percent), not down, compared with the same period a year earlier. That was tied for 18th best among the states, and only slightly trailed the national average wage increase. -- By March 2013, the average increase was 1.2 percent, three times better than the national average. -- By June 2013, the increase was 2.2 percent, slightly above the national average and tied for 19th. -- For the one-year period ending in the September 2013 quarter, the state’s wage growth was fifth best in the country, beating the national average (3.4 percent gain vs. 1.9 percent gain). The picture changes This latest report came out five days before the release of Burke’s economic plan. It shows Wisconsin’s wage growth in that period ahead of all adjoining Midwest states and behind only North Dakota, South Dakota, Louisiana and Nebraska nationally. Drilling down, average Wisconsin wages grew 2.8 percent in goods-producing jobs and 3.7 percent in service jobs. In sum, the 2013 picture on wage growth so far is much different than the one for 2012, but is omitted by Burke. Her jobs plan pointedly blames "misguided" Walker actions over three years for helping make Wisconsin’s recovery an outlier -- while examining only one quarterly report of wage data from 2012. We filled in that gap some more by looking at other quarterly wage reports that reflect wage trends in Walker’s first year, 2011. In those, Wisconsin’s wage increase topped the national mark twice. In a third, average wages dropped both nationally and in Wisconsin (-1.6 percent and -2.2 percent, respectively). Burke’s campaign told us she meant to spotlight a long-term gap between Wisconsin and U.S. earnings growth trends. That gap exists, according to a Journal Sentinel story on March 25, 2014 that said, since 2009, Wisconsin's personal net earnings have rebounded after the recession but more slowly than the nation, based on data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. That data came out the same day Burke made her jobs plan public. Burke’s jobs plan does, we note, discuss job and wage trends in the context both of Walker and the years preceding his election. But her campaign pointed us to nothing that shows Wisconsin’s average wages have dropped over an extended period, much less at twice the rate of the mark in other states. Our rating Burke’s economic plan said that "Wisconsin wages are declining at double the rate of other states." That was the situation in one quarter ending in September 2012, but Wisconsin wages are not declining at all based on much more current data. Burke’s plan cherry-picked an outdated report that turned out to be an anomaly. More recent data that shows Wisconsin’s average wages not only growing but topping the national mark three quarters in a row. All this is easily accessed on federal websites and publicized in news releases issued by federal officials. We think that makes this claim not only false but ridiculous. Pants on Fire.

pomt-11139	Says Austin has "been ranked repeatedly as one of the most, if not the most, economically segregated cities in the country."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2018/may/31/greg-casar/greg-casar-says-austin-ranked-repeatedly-high-econ/	An official concerned about government not enforcing fair housing regulations says Austin has long been known to be a city divided. Greg Casar, who represents District 4 on the Austin City Council, told the Austin American-Statesman in May 2018: "We do have a really serious problem in Austin. We’ve been ranked repeatedly as one of the most, if not the most, economically segregated cities in the country." Economic segregation can briefly be defined as residential division by income. And has Austin repeatedly been ranked high by that metric? Casar notes three studies To our request for elaboration, Shelby Alexander in Casar’s council office said by email that three recent studies classified Austin as economically segregated to a great degree. A February 2015 study, explored at the time in an American-Statesman news story, ranked the Austin-Round Rock-San Marcos area the country’s most economically segregated large metro area. That study, overseen by Richard Florida for the University of Toronto-based Martin Prosperity Institute, evaluated the nation’s 350-plus metro areas based on individual and combined measures of income, educational and occupational segregation plus an overall economic segregation index. The study ranked Austin first for economic segregation among metro areas with populations of 1 million or more. The San Antonio area ranked third, the Houston area was fourth and the Dallas area was seventh. Among all U.S. metros, the study found the Tallahassee and Trenton areas to have the greatest economic segregation, followed by the metro areas of Austin, Tucson, San Antonio, Houston, Ann Arbor, Bridgeport and Los Angeles: SOURCE: Report, "Segregated City, The Geography of Economic Segregation in America’s Metros," Martin Prosperity Institute, Rotman School of Management University of Toronto, February 2015 We followed up with Florida, who pointed us by email to his 2017 book, "The New Urban Crisis," in which Florida says that since 2003, he’s explored his finding that the country’s "creative cities" including Austin double as "epicenters of economic inequality." "Austin," the book says, "is divided east to west… Its creative class is concentrated in a huge wedge to the west that runs from downtown through its high-end suburbs out to Round Rock and in another separate bloc in the far southeastern portion of the metro. Austin’s downtown has seen substantial revitalization, including the development of large amounts of new housing. The service-class and smaller working-class areas are massed entirely in the more disadvantaged areas of the east." Also pointed out by Casar's aide: A 2017 study funded by the Urban Institute presenting economic segregation indexes for the 100 most populous U.S. "commuting zones" (similar to metro areas) as of the 1990 census. Generally, the institute study says, the "share of Americans living in middle-income neighborhoods dropped from 65 percent in 1970 to 42 percent in 2009, and the share of families living in neighborhoods defined as either rich or poor has grown rapidly." Since 2000, the report says, "the number of people living in areas of concentrated poverty has nearly doubled, from 7.2 million to 13.8 million in 2013." Also, the report says, "the proportion of families living in high-income neighborhoods has risen." The researchers analyzed economic segregation, the report says, by using the Generalized Neighborhood Sorting Index (GNSI), described as measuring how many people of similar incomes "clump" together within a metro region, how many poor households tend to live in neighborhoods made up of mostly other poor households and how many rich households tend to live in neighborhoods made up of other richer households. From 1990 through 2010, the report says, Austin ranked among a dozen communities consistently placing in the top quarter of the nation’s economically segregated areas. But as of 2010, 10 of the 12 areas had greater eco-segregation, the report says: New York; Charlotte, N.C.; Kansas City; Philadelphia; Louisville; San Francisco; Nashville; Dallas; St. Louis; and Washington, D.C. Among all 100 zones, Austin in 2010 ranked 18th in economic segregation--up from 25th in 2000 but down from 13th in 1990, according to a table in the study’s appendix. Dallas, the table says, was 15th, Houston was 28th, El Paso was 36th, San Antonio was 42nd, Fort Worth was 43rd, Brownsville was 86th. That year, the table says, New York ranked first by the metric ahead of No. 2 Bridgeport, Conn., and No. 3 Charlotte. Alexander also noted an April 2018 institute report ranking cities--not metro areas--by income and racial inclusion. By email, the institute’s Christina Stacy answered our inquiry by confirming that in 2013 by the institute’s analysis, Austin was outpaced for "income segregation" by only nine of 274 cities. INCOME SEGREGATION INDEX, 2013, AUSTIN (BLUE) AND NATIONAL AVG (YELLOW) SOURCE: Report, "Measuring Inclusion in America’s Cities," the Urban Institute, April 25, 2018 "Although Austin ranks as highly segregated," Stacy wrote, "it did improve on segregation between 2000 and 2013 while most other cities worsened. So, it has shown some improvement, but is still toward the bottom of the pack." Another expert Another expert, Brown University sociologist John Logan, answered our inquiry with an email pointing out research placing the Austin area in 2010-14 16th among the nation’s most populous cities and 17th among all evaluated metro areas for economic segregation. Logan, presented with Casar’s claim, commented that the "Austin metro is on the high end, but not so high as to merit the characterization as ‘one of the most, if not the most, economically segregated cities in the country.’" "The general point is that all U.S. metro areas are highly segregated by income," Logan wrote, "and that has consequences for the lives of residents." We circled back to Casar, who agreed in replies emailed by his office that Austin’s level of economic segregation might be decreasing and that no study placed Austin by itself No. 1 by that metric. "You could see how looking beyond the city proper makes sense," Casar replied. "Consider, for example, that it’s commonplace for smaller municipalities within a larger metro area to show segregation, with some predominantly higher income and others predominantly lower income. It's also a problem that some central city neighborhoods see higher income people leave to suburbs nearby, thereby exacerbating segregation. It's also common for some lower income people to be pushed out of city limits, further away from services, also exacerbating segregation." Our ruling Casar said Austin has "been ranked repeatedly as one of the most, if not the most, economically segregated cities in the country." Austin and the Austin region have repeatedly been ranked among the nation’s most economically segregated areas. We didn’t find a ranking that placed the city or area No. 1 by this indicator though the University of Toronto study ranked the Austin area first among areas of 1 million residents or more. In that analysis, the Austin area landed third overall. We rate Casar’s claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-04333	"We got back every dime used to rescue the banks."	mostly true	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/oct/25/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-banks-paid-back-all-federal-bail/	On the campaign trail, President Barack Obama has spoken much more of the bailouts for auto companies than their bank brethren. But, far from Detroit, the president raised the issue of the bank bailouts last week in New Hampshire. Speaking before a crowd of about 6,000 voters in Manchester, N.H., Obama assured supporters that of all the fiscal issues facing the nation, the bank bailouts are no longer among them. "We got back every dime used to rescue the banks," he told the crowd gathered Oct. 18 in Victory Park. "We made that happen." As of this month, four years have passed since federal lawmakers salvaged some of the nations largest banks with the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. But, now, the question is, how much of the money has the government received back? We decided to crunch the numbers. In past rulings, PolitiFact has looked into statements about the auto industry bailout, and last month, we ruled Mostly False on a claim from former President Bill Clinton’s that the total bailout program has earned a profit. But, Obama’s claim about the bank bailouts, specifically, seemed to be worth a fresh look. To start, we reached out to the Obama campaign, which directed us first to the U.S. Treasury, which releases daily updates on the Temporary Assets Relief Program. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, which created the TARP, initially offered up to $700 billion to banks, auto companies, insurance agencies and mortgage lenders, among other groups. In 2010, Congress amended the law to limit the spending to $475 billion. Now, four years later, lawmakers have thus far distributed $466 billion of that total, according to the Treasury, and, of that total, about $370.4 billion has been returned, including $41.9 billion from interest and dividends, among other income sources. But, of those the totals, the bank payments that the president referenced are only a portion. Of the $466 billion distributed, about $245.2 billion have gone to banks, both national and local. And, as of Oct. 18, the day of the president’s speech, the government had taken back about $266.7 billion, according to the treasury count-- about $21.5 billion more than the initial investment. "TARP’s bank programs have already earned a significant profit for taxpayers," Matthew Anderson, a Treasury Department spokesman, wrote in an email to PolitiFact NH. But, that total doesn’t necessarily mean the banks have paid back in full. The treasury report shows that, of the $245.2 billion disbursements, $232.9 been have been repaid. The $33.8 billion difference between the repayments and the total cash collected has come through interest, dividends and other revenue sources. These numbers differ slightly from those reported by ProPublica, a Pulitzer-winning investigative group, which tracks the federal figures on its Bailout Tracker. ProPublica, which categorizes the payments differently, reports that banks have returned $223.9 billion, which, along with $31.9 billion collected in interest other revenues, has left the government with a $19.6 billion gain. But, the point is the same, noted Paul Kiel, who authors the Bailout Tracker. "Essentially, the treasury has realized a profit on the bank portion of the TARP investments," Kiel wrote last week in an email message. Those profits could rise even higher. The treasury, which purchased stock from 707 banks, still holds investments in about 280 of them. But, if we expand the definition, as ProPublica does, to include investment agencies and credit card companies, among other financial institutions, more than 400 companies still have debts outstanding with the government, Kiel wrote in a September blog post. Most of these banks, however, are small institutions who are struggling to stay afloat, Kiel wrote. Of the 400-plus, 162 have fallen behind on their dividend payments to the treasury, he wrote, and, according to a March report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, 130 banks were included on the government’s list of "problem banks," demonstrating "financial, operational, or managerial weaknesses that threatened their continued financial viability." "While repayments, dividends, and interest from institutions participating ... have exceeded the program’s original investment disbursements, the number of missed payments has increased over the life of the program," government officials wrote in the GAO report. "Institutions that continue to miss payments and problem institutions may have difficulty ever fully repaying their … investments." Our ruling: Not all of the banks who received TARP money have repaid the loans. In fact, 400-plus banks are still on the government’s red list -- more than have completed the payments -- and, according to the GAO, some may never pay the money back. But, the fact remains, due to interest, dividends and other revenue streams, the government has received more money back ($266.7 billion, according to the Treasury) than it handed out to banks under the bailout law ($245.2 billion).

pomt-01899	"Light rail does not reduce congestion."	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/jul/03/no-tax-tracks/greenlight-pinellas-opponent-says-light-rail-does-/	Critics of the Greenlight Pinellas mass transit initiative are attacking the plan at full speed by questioning the effectiveness of the proposal’s light rail line. The group’s home page, RailTaxFacts.com, features a commercial arguing against pro-transit talking points, such as light rail creating long-term economic growth and reducing traffic congestion. The video shows a "Truth Meter" (not to be confused with PolitiFact Florida’s Truth-O-Meter) rating the statements false. "Light rail does not reduce congestion," the website says under the video. Greenlight Pinellas plans a 24-mile light rail route from St. Petersburg to Clearwater projected to cost $2 billion over a decade. We wondered if the idea of reduced congestion was a dependable guidepost, or if we’re all being taken for a ride. Railing against rail Light rail is generally considered to be a rail line that either shares space with roads or is a separate, above-ground commuter line, as opposed to a subway or elevated train. The Greenlight Pinellas plan calls for a proposed line with 16 stations to provide a 57-minute total trip time between St. Pete and Clearwater. It’s slated to be installed and operational within 10 years and serve as an anchor for future transit additions. Greenlight also has plans for bus rapid transit and expanded service, which we’ve addressed before, but in this case, No Tax For Tracks says a common talking point by light rail advocates is that a rail system will decrease congestion. One of the group’s supporting links is a Washington Post Wonkblog post linking to another post from The Atlantic suggesting light rail’s effects on congestion are debatable. The other piece of evidence is an April 2014 analysis by David McKalip, a St. Petersburg neurosurgeon and No Tax For Tracks supporter, concluding light rail actually increases congestion. McKalip writes about how despite extensive rail investment in Portland, Ore., the city saw more people in cars and higher traffic volumes in the subsequent years. He also cites another Atlantic post discussing a study of four British cities that showed light rail didn’t get people out of their cars, but did take them off buses. "I have yet to find any science ever that says congestion goes down," McKalip told PolitiFact Florida. "Experts say, ‘do not make that assertion.’ " McKalip followed up his post with another on July 1 saying car travel times in the Tampa Bay area are routinely faster than in other cities with rail and there is no concrete evidence of a relationship between congestion reduction and light rail. An essay by public transit planning consultant and author Jarrett Walker says that while transit has several benefits that make cities more sustainable and improves quality of life, a definite correlation between service and fewer cars isn’t apparent. Thinking ahead Many transit experts don’t agree with that conclusion. Todd Litman, founder and executive director of the Victoria Transport Policy Institute in Canada, said "traffic congestion and economic impacts vary considerably depending on specific circumstances and how the impacts are measured." He said that a transit system with sufficient demand and adequate supporting policies can indeed reduce congestion. He cited several studies that showed congestion increased at a higher rate in areas without light rail. One showed that in Denver, there was a 31 percent increase in vehicle traffic in light rail corridors, as opposed to 41 percent elsewhere. Another said Baltimore’s congestion increase dropped from 2.8 percent to 1.5 percent annually after building light rail. One Los Angeles study said people who lived within a half-mile of one light rail line in the city traveled an average of 10 to 12 miles less by car per day. Another said that Utah’s TRAX system dropped the estimated number of vehicles on the studied corridor from 44,000 to 22,300 per day. PSTA told PolitiFact Florida that reducing future congestion is the guideline Greenlight Pinellas is addressing, offering Pinellas County residents a transportation option in the face of projected population growth across the region. Vukan Vuchic, transportation engineering professor at the University of Pennsylvania, said that’s a sufficient way to measure a reduction in congestion. Cities inevitably will keep growing, and thanks to an ingrained car culture, the only way to ensure a net loss of vehicles is to completely reorganize entire cities with pedestrian zones and policies that make car ownership prohibitive. "Yes, we see people are buying more cars and driving more miles, but we didn’t give people a choice," he said, adding that communities must make a conscious choice to enact many policies aimed at reducing congestion. "It’s not automatic. It’s not like you put in a rail line and it’s automatically beautiful." Our ruling No Tax For Tracks said "light rail does not reduce congestion." The studies we looked at didn’t show a strict reduction in congestion. However, there are studies that show congestion grows more slowly in communities that have implemented light rail, especially if they do so in conjunction with other policies that give people an option not to drive.

pomt-06185	"Only one president has ever cut Medicare for seniors in this country . . . Barack Obama."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/12/mitt-romney/romney-says-only-obama-has-cut-medicare/	Medicare, the health insurance program for seniors and the disabled, constitutes a massive and growing share of federal spending. Yet Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney says that in the more than four decades since its inception, only one president has ever cut the program’s budget. "Let's not forget, only one president has ever cut Medicare for seniors in this country, and it's Barack Obama," Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, said in a Republican presidential debate on Dec. 10, 2011. We looked into the accuracy of that statement and found Romney is way off. First, did Obama cut Medicare? The Romney campaign did not respond to our inquiry about this statement. We assume that when he said Obama cut Medicare, he was talking about the 2010 health care reform law that, among other things, reduces future Medicare spending by $500 billion. But that’s just it -- the cuts don’t come from the current Medicare budget, they put a leash on future growth and payment increases. PolitiFact has explored this before: "The Affordable Care Act does reduce Medicare spending by $500 billion over the next 10 years. But here’s the catch: Those dollars aren’t taken out of the current budget, they are not actual cuts, and nowhere does the bill actually eliminate any current benefits," we wrote last month. Which brings us to the next point. We note that, in the debate, Romney specified that Obama cut Medicare "for seniors." That sounds like he meant that Obama cut Medicare benefits. That notion falls flat too. The health care law does not reduce benefits -- in fact, it enhances them. "The Affordable Care Act improves the benefits in Medicare, in terms of prevention, in terms of filling in the donut hole in Medicare Part D for prescription drugs," said Jonathan Oberlander, a health policy professor at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. Oberlander said there’s only one "leg to stand on" in interpreting that the law reduces benefits. "The Affordable Care Act reduces payments to Medicare Advantage plans. They’re overpaid by quite a lot -- excess payments above and beyond what it costs to treat people," he said. "As a result of that, there are projections that some of those (plans) are going to trim some of the extra benefits." Those could include benefits for vision or dental care. "But," Oberlander said, "that hasn’t happened so far, and it doesn’t affect the core benefits, the required Medicare benefits." Did other presidents make cuts? In short, yes. John Rother, president and CEO of the National Coalition on Health Care, a coalition of trade associations, labor unions and advocacy groups that supports health care reform, offered some historical perspective on the matter. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan in his first year in office signed an omnibus budget reconciliation act that raised Medicare deductibles for beneficiaries. Rother said he considers that a cut in benefits. Two years later, Reagan and Congress enacted legislation that changed the way Medicare reimbursed hospitals. The program’s costs had been growing exponentially as hospitals treated patients and then sent the federal government the bills. It was known as "retrospective cost-based reimbursement." The new law established a "prospective payment system," which categorized inpatient admission cases into what were called diagnosis-related groups (DRGs). In this system, Medicare pays hospitals a flat rate for each inpatient case. "The system was intended to motivate hospitals to change the way they deliver services. With DRGs, it did not matter what hospitals charged anymore -- Medicare capped their payments," according to a 2001 report by the Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General. The resulting savings to Medicare were $21-billion in the first three years, exceeding even the Congressional Budget Office projections. It cut the program, Rother said, but did not affect benefits. In 1987, Reagan signed a law that expanded Medicare benefits, including drug coverage and catastrophic illness coverage. But when George H.W. Bush took office, he repealed it. So Rother puts Bush in the column of presidents who cut Medicare for seniors. The Medicare program saw another major overhaul in 1997. President Bill Clinton signed the Balanced Budget Act, which tightened payments to doctors, nursing homes, home health agencies and health insurance plans and expanded the types of private plans that could participate in Medicare (the part of the program now known as Medicare Advantage). Its goal was to trim $393.8 billion in spending over 10 years. But it’s a trickier question to answer whether that law cut benefits. "With Clinton, it’s an indirect effect," Rother said. "It did cut reimbursements to several providers who claimed they would not be able to serve the beneficiary population." The tally, then: * Reagan cut Medicare by reducing payments to hospitals, and he cut benefits by raising deductibles. * George H.W. Bush cut benefits by repealing a law that would have expanded coverage for drugs and catastrophic illness. * Clinton cut Medicare by changing payments to doctors and other providers, which could be considered to have an indirect effect on beneficiaries. * Obama cut future Medicare spending but expanded benefits. Our ruling Romney said, "only one president has ever cut Medicare for seniors in this country and it's Barack Obama." The statement gets it wrong on every front. The Medicare belt was tightened in 1981 and 1982 under Reagan, in 1989 under the first President Bush and again in 1997 under Clinton. So Obama is in no way the only president to cut the program. Further, by specifying that Obama cut Medicare "for seniors," Romney seems to mean that the president slashed benefits, not just the program’s spending. That’s even more egregious. Other presidents have made changes to Medicare that reduced benefits for seniors, while the health care law Obama signed actually increases them. That’s a lot of inaccuracy in a single sentence. We rate Romney’s statement False.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2011-12-12T17:47:59	2011-12-10	['Medicare_(United_States)', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-11793	"We’ve cut taxes 75 times, cut $7.5 billion worth in taxes, and as a result we’ve added over 1.3 million jobs."	half-true	/florida/statements/2017/nov/21/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-he-cut-taxes-75-times-created-13-m/	For years, Republican Gov. Rick Scott has touted an ever-growing pile of tax cuts he has achieved for the state. In 2013, he claimed he cut taxes 24 times. In 2014, that number grew to 40. Now, as Scott rounds out his last full year in office (and ponders a run for the U.S. Senate), the tally has been raised once more. "We’ve cut taxes 75 times, cut $7.5 billion worth in taxes, and as a result we’ve added over 1.3 million jobs," Scott said Nov. 9 during a news conference in Tampa. Scott's past boasts rated Half True, because Scott relied on some creative math to reach his tax cut total. He did that again in this claim, but he went even further when he said those tax cuts resulted in the creation of 1.3 million jobs. Experts say the cuts may be a factor in job growth, but they're likely not the most critical one. "The governor takes credit for all the jobs created since he took office, but with so many other driving factors at play, it's difficult to attribute these jobs to the tax cuts," said Joe Pennisi with the Florida Policy Institute. Breaking down the cuts Scott’s team sent PolitiFact Florida a list of 82 "tax cuts" that reduced government revenues by a combined $7.7 billion. (You can see the list from 2011-16 here; the 2017 list is here.) As in times past, the list counts Florida's mostly annual sales tax holiday, includes reductions in fees such as lowering the cost to obtain a concealed weapons permit, and counts a measure that stopped an automatic fee increase to obtain a hunting or fishing license. Many of the measures are extremely targeted and many only affect businesses. However, they do reduce state government revenue, which is why Scott broadly defines them as a tax cut, even if they aren't. Asked to back up the governor's statement, his office sent us a more nuanced statement about how the tax cuts "helped" contribute to positive economic growth — it did not as directly link the cuts to jobs. "As the governor has said for the past seven years, cutting taxes has helped turn around Florida’s economy, made our state more business-friendly, and has allowed job creators to invest more in creating new opportunities — all of which has helped Florida businesses create more than 1.3 million new jobs," said Scott spokeswoman Kerri Wyland. We organized the list into four broad categories: targeted breaks (21 items), sales tax reductions or exemptions (25), breaks for businesses (17), and fee reductions (12). Targeted breaks The largest chunk of tax cuts reduce the amount of taxes collected on a very specific good, service or industry. Examples include tax exemptions for first responders and surviving spouses, eliminating the sales taxes on repairs to planes between 2,000 and 15,000 pounds, and increasing financial assistance for businesses to donate to community development and housing projects for low-income residents. Also counted is a renewable energy tax exemption that exempts 80 percent of the value of a renewable energy source from tangible personal property tax for all applicants, residential and nonresidential. Sales tax breaks One thing to remember about sales tax exemptions and reductions: You have to consume the goods to get the break — and most offered temporary relief. The tax cut package from 2014 included several exemptions, including a temporary cut for the purchase of cement mixing drums for cement trucks. Scott’s list also counts about $20 million worth of sales tax exemptions for child car seats and youth bike helmets, prescribed diet pet food, and prepaid college meal plans. These last until the end of 2017. The agriculture industry has also seen sales tax breaks, such as the 2015 exemption that was extended for trailers and irrigation equipment related to production. The manufacturing industry also got a permanent exemption on mechanical equipment. Exemptions in 2017 include health products for livestock poultry and aquaculture, construction building materials, feminine hygiene products and medical marijuana delivery devices. Scott counted the mostly annual tax-free shopping holiday around seven different times since 2017. From 2011-17 there was a tax-free holiday in the month of August for shoes, clothing and school supply purchases. It also exempted sales taxes on laptops and tablets, up to $750 in four of the years. Most of the holidays were three days, but in 2015, there was a 10-day period for the break. The state has offered the holiday since 1998 except in 2002, 2003, 2008, 2009. Cuts for businesses Kurt Wenner, Florida TaxWatch vice president of research, pointed out that several tax cuts on Scott’s list aim to build a more competitive business climate, such as the permanent sales tax exemption for manufacturing equipment. He said targeting capital expenses, particularly in industries with high wages, stimulates the economy. Scott and the Legislature have worked to expand tax credits for businesses for areas such as research and development; cleaning up contaminated sites known as brownfields; and increasing the amount of money available for credits under a "new market" program. Per Scott’s wishes, the Legislature expanded the exemption for corporate income taxes from $5,000 to $25,000 in 2011, and again in 2012 to $50,000, sparing thousands of businesses from paying the tax. The hit to the state budget for both is about $30 million a year. Another notable example in this section came in the most recent legislative session when lawmakers pared the sales tax on the total rent paid for any commercial property from 6 percent to 5.8 percent, a loss of $25 million in tax revenue in 2017. Fee reductions The Legislature has targeted fees for specific licenses during Scott’s tenure. Lawmakers blocked an automatic inflation adjustment for hunting and fishing license fees costing the state almost $20 million from 2013-17. They also reduced the cost of licenses renewal for concealed weapons from $60 to $50, and then again in 2017 to $45. One significant fee reduction came in 2014 with SB 156, which rolled back motor vehicle registration fee increases, saving motorists about $25 a year per vehicle registration. No hard evidence tax cuts led to jobs No doubt, Scott has cut taxes in his seven years as governor. Our quibble is with the claim that he did it 75 times, which is an inflated statistic. His claim that those tax cuts created 1.3 million jobs, however, is on shakier ground. "It’s hard to determine exactly how many jobs the tax cuts produced; however, it's economically expected that spending more is going to help the economy and in turn create jobs," Wenner said. Experts said a bulk of the tax cuts (especially the sales tax holidays and narrow sales tax exemptions) have a minimal effect on the economy. "What causes businesses to hire more employees is demand for their services," said Jonathan Hamilton, an economic professor at the University of Florida. "The (tax cuts) on Scott’s list all account for a relatively small reduction in their costs." Pennisi pointed to research from left-leaning organizations that show tax cuts and business incentives fail to have a significant impact on economic activity and job creation. Businesses don’t necessarily use extra savings to hire more employees. "Hiring is driven by the demand for a business’ goods and services rather than the presence in the owner’s pocket of a few more dollars made available through tax cuts," Pennisi said in a 2016 brief. He said the bulk of the governor’s tax cuts would not be expected to create that demand. Looking for more evidence Scott's tax cuts can't solely be the reason the state added 1.3 million jobs? In July 2010, before Scott was elected governor, state economists predicted that the national economic recovery would mean 1 million new jobs for Florida by 2017. That was before Scott was elected or ever cut a tax. Our ruling Scott said, "We’ve cut taxes 75 times, cut $7.5 billion worth in taxes, and as a result we’ve added over 1.3 million jobs." Scott is including anything that reduces government revenues to claim he's cut taxes 75 times. But, as we've said before, the list includes things that are clearly not tax cuts. In addition, Scott is claiming those tax cuts have resulted in the creation of 1.3 million jobs. The fact is, state economists predicted Florida would add 1 million jobs in over the same time period before Scott was even elected governor and had an opportunity to enact his policies. Experts say tax cuts may be a reason the state has seen jobs rebound, but it's not the sole or even most important reason. Scott’s claim is partially accurate and overplays the connection to more than 1 million jobs. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-10277	John McCain has seven houses.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/22/barack-obama/updated-eight-houses-for-john-and-cindy-mccain/	UPDATED: How many homes John McCain owns became an unlikely campaign issue on Aug. 20, 2008, when he told the Politico Web site that he didn't know the answer. "I think — I'll have my staff get to you," McCain told Politico in Las Cruces, N.M. "It's condominiums where — I'll have them get to you." It's not hard to see how McCain got confused. The McCain family owns properties in multiple states under several names. We checked this issue earlier when it was raised on the campaign trail by Barack Obama's top strategist, David Axelrod. Axelrod was arguing that the McCain campaign is guilty of hypocrisy in trying to paint Obama as an elitist. "Obviously, his strategists met on the portico of the McCain estate in Sedona — or maybe in one of his six other houses — and decided what line of attack they were going to use," Axelrod told Adam Nagourney of the New York Times. The Democratic National Committee has also attacked McCain as being out of touch. In an Aug. 12 news release called "Seven Months of Job Losses for Americans, Seven Houses for McCain," the DNC said McCain fails to understand the economic difficulties of Americans. Bloggers have repeated the claim and created video tours of the McCain properties. Initially we confirmed that McCain owns seven homes, but Politico found a third condo that the McCains own in Phoenix, which we missed, and that brings the total to eight. One of their properties, a ranch in Sedona, also has multiple buildings on it that could be counted as additional homes. We count it as one. The property is owned under several names, including limited liability companies and family trusts. Public records connect these entities to Cindy McCain, chairwoman of Hensley & Co, a huge Anheuser-Busch beer distributorship that was founded by her parents. Here's a rundown of the properties and how we get to our total. 1. The largest home is a creekside ranch near Sedona, Ariz., spread over more than six acres. That's where McCain entertained vice presidential prospects, including Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, over Memorial Day weekend. Records from Yavapai County Assessor's Office show it includes three houses and is worth about $1.1-million. CNN reported that McCain said there are six houses on the property. The owner is listed as the Cindy Hensley McCain Family Trust. If McCain is correct that there are six houses on the property and you counted each one, the total homes owned would rise to 13 (though again, when pressed by Politico about properties, McCain said he wasn't sure). 2. and 3. In nearby Phoenix, Cindy McCain owns two combined condo units worth about $1.7-million. They're part of the Residences at 2211 Camelback, which bills itself as "The Valley of the Sun's finest example of life beyond the expected" at "the most preferred urban residential address in the prestigious Camelback Corridor." Wild River Rental LLC, which records show is controlled by Cindy McCain, owns another unit in the building, which was purchased in 2007 for $830,000. (This is the unit we missed in our first go round.) 4. In Arlington, Va., the McCains live in a three-bedroom high-rise condo worth $847,800, property records show. 5. They also own a condo in La Jolla, Calif., that's worth more than $1-million. The building overlooks a park and the Pacific Ocean. Records also link the McCains to three other residences. 6. Wild River Rental LLC, the company controlled by Cindy McCain, is listed as the owner of Phoenix condo worth more than half a million dollars. The McCains bought the condo for their daughter Meghan, according to a story in GQ magazine and confirmed through a public records search. The reporter compared the inside to "a spaceship furnished by West Elm. There's a giant silver chimney that extends out of her fireplace into the ceiling about twenty feet above." 7. and 8. Dream Catcher Family LLC, a domestic corporation formed by the McCain family, owns two condos in a beachfront complex in Coronado, Calif. Tax records show one is valued at $2.7-million. The other was purchased this year, according to sales records. A sales price was not available. The Obama campaign has released two ads since McCain's gaffe saying that McCain owns seven homes. The Obama campaign doesn't mention that trusts and companies controlled by Cindy McCain generally own the properties. And their count is off by one; the McCain family actually owns eight. We'll be monitoring this property issue as the campaign goes on. It's possible that there are other properties owned by corporate entities related to the McCains of which we are not aware. As we re-examined this claim after confirming the eighth property, we've come to a slightly different conclusion about the true ownership of the homes. Because there is indirect ownership here, though these are clearly the McCains' homes, we rule the statement Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-08-22T00:00:00	2008-08-11	['None']
pomt-10271	The Bush administration's latest plans for troop withdrawal from Iraq by 2011 are "more or less the same time frame I announced two years ago."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/24/barack-obama/more-like-one-year-ago/	As events unfold in Iraq, the political campaigns react. On Aug. 21, 2008, for example, news broke that the Bush administration and officials in Iraq were negotiating an agreement that envisioned U.S. troops leaving Iraq by 2011. Barack Obama gave an interview to USA Today the same day in which he discussed his Iraq policy. He pointed to the 2011 date and said it matched his own policies. "It's more or less the same time frame I announced two years ago," Obama said. We looked back two years ago to find Obama's statements on Iraq. The most salient example from that time was a speech he gave on Iraq to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs on Nov. 20, 2006. Obama criticized the Bush administration's handling of the war in Iraq and emphasized the need for a strategy that finds a political solution to the conflict. "The first part of this strategy begins by exerting the greatest leverage we have on the Iraqi government — a phased redeployment of U.S. troops from Iraq on a timetable that would begin in four to six months," Obama said. "When I first advocated steps along these lines over a year ago, I had hoped that this phased redeployment could begin by the end of 2006. Such a timetable may now need to begin in 2007, but begin it must." A few months later, in January 2007, Obama proposed legislation that would have started pulling out troops in May 2007 with a goal of having all combat troops out by March 31, 2008. The legislation included provisions to halt the withdrawal in case of national interest or if the Iraqi government met certain targets. The legislation didn't pass, and it probably never had much of a chance given President Bush's opposition to withdrawal. On the campaign trail in 2007, Obama began discussing timetables for withdrawal that would begin with a new administration taking office in 2009. At a debate on Sept. 26, 2007, Obama said, "I believe that we should have all our troops out by 2013, but I don't want to make promises not knowing what the situation's going to be three or four years out." As the campaign proceeded, Obama discussed removing troops at a pace of about one brigade a month, noting that complete withdrawal would take "about 16 months," or around the middle of 2010. He included caveats to allow for changing circumstances on the ground and the advice of military advisers. To sum up the timetables here: • The Bush administration is negotiating a 2011 withdrawal date. • Two years ago, Obama proposed a withdrawal date of 2008. • When that proposal foundered, Obama moved to a withdrawal window based on a 16-month timeline, withdrawing all troops between 2010 and 2013. Obama's statement to USA Today says the Bush administration's latest plans for troop withdrawal from Iraq are "more or less the same time frame I announced two years ago." We'll agree that the 2011 date could be "more or less" the timeframe that Obama has proposed. But we don't see much similarity between the new 2011 withdrawal date and what Obama advocated two years ago. It's closer to what he began advocating a year ago. Obama stretches the timeline a little bit here in a way that's not supported by the facts, though we'll grant that Obama was calling for a general withdrawal two years ago and John McCain was not. So we rate Obama's statement Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-08-24T00:00:00	2008-08-21	['Iraq', 'George_W._Bush']
pomt-12638	"K-12 education is getting more money this year than they did last year. ... It is a total increase of 4.1 percent."	mostly false	/missouri/statements/2017/mar/28/eric-greitens/greitens-hasnt-increased-education-budget-4-percen/	Gov. Eric Greitens announced his recommended budget for fiscal year 2018 at a preschool for students with special needs in Nixa, Mo., instead of at the Capitol in Jefferson City. By speaking at a preschool, the new Republican governor said he was highlighting his commitment to public elementary and secondary education. Greitens described the difficult challenge he encountered making cuts to balance Missouri's "broken budget." The budget was broken, he said, by decreased tax revenues paid by special interests and by rising health care costs due to the Affordable Care Act. He promised K-12 classrooms would be protected from budget cuts. After the speech, Greitens took questions from the press. One reporter asked for clarification about elementary and secondary education funding and higher education funding. Greitens said: "K-12 education is getting more money this year than they did last year. And just to be specific, I’ll give you the exact numbers. Last year it was $5,914,000,000. This year is $5,951,000,000. We’re actually increasing spending for K-12 education. There will be more money from gaming funds, federal funds and state funds into K-12 education. It is a total increase of 4.1 percent." We wanted to check into this claim, especially because cuts Greitens proposed to school transportation would cause some schools to dip into other accounts to transport kids to and from school. Education department numbers Right off the bat, Greitens is correct in saying that the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education would receive more total funding than in FY 2017 under his proposed FY 2018 budget. And the budgeted numbers he cited also check out. According to the governor's FY 2018 budget, last year the department received a total of $5,914,605,606 to fund public schools and other programs. This year Greitens recommends appropriating $5,950,859,927. But the governor said this was a 4.1 percent increase. The $36.3 million increase was actually an increase of 0.613 percent — just a little off. PolitiFact tried to get in contact with Greitens to understand where he came up with his 4.1 percent figure. His office referred us to the Department of Revenue, and his press secretary has not responded to our calls and emails. Throughout the speech, Greitens reiterated he was was increasing funds to K-12 education, but according to records available in the Office of Administration, he’s not increasing funds as much as previous years. Since unveiling his budget proposal, Greitens recommended that $11 million of $52 million received from a tobacco legal settlement be put toward K-12 school bus transportation. That increases the total amount for the department to $5.96 billion, or an 0.8 percent increase over the previous year. School transportation allocation Even with this additional money, Greitens’ proposal would still underfund school districts’ requests for reimbursement in transportation spending. To fully fund all of the school district's transportation requests, the department would need to dole out $280 million, said Roger Dorson, deputy commissioner of financial and administrative services for the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. The extra $11 million puts the total for transportation up to $80 million. School administrators were quick to point out when Greitens first unveiled his budget that school transportation funding decreased 34 percent from the previous year — or $36 million. To make up for this, administrators said they’d have to take money from classrooms or make changes to their local busing policy. By law, districts must transport students who live more than 3.5 miles from school, and the state will reimburse up to 75 percent of the total cost for the district. Additionally, the governor’s budget won’t fully fund the Foundation Formula by nearly $45 million. The formula determines how state money will be allocated to each district to ensure that every student, no matter where he or she lives, receives an adequate education. When the formula isn’t fully funded, schools must find other sources of money — or make cuts — to meet their financial needs, said Shari LaPage, the the chief budget officer of the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. Greitens is giving $3.2 million more to the formula than the previous fiscal year, yet the amount still isn’t enough to allocate the amount of money to each school as required by law. Since 2014, the Foundation Formula hasn’t been fully funded. Our ruling Greitens said, "K-12 education is getting more money this year than they did last year. ... It is a total increase of 4.1 percent." Greitens is right that his proposal for FY 2018 would allocate more money to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, but he is overstates the size of the increase. Even after including the money from the tobacco legal settlement, the increase would still be less than 1 percent. And the funding for core K-12 education falls short of the state’s own benchmark formula. We rate this claim Mostly False.	None	Eric Greitens	None	None	None	2017-03-28T17:24:46	2017-02-02	['None']
pomt-02249	Says Gov. Scott Walker’s repeal of a 2009 law has left Wisconsin as "one of five states without an equal pay law protecting women from gender discrimination in their paycheck."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/apr/13/mary-burke/mary-burke-says-scott-walker-left-wisconsin-women-/	Democratic candidate for governor Mary Burke minced no words on Equal Pay Day, April 8, 2014, charging that Gov. Scott Walker has left women behind in the Wisconsin workplace. "Following Scott Walker's repeal in 2012 of protections against gender discrimination, Wisconsin is now one of just five states without an equal pay law," the Madison School Board member said in a media statement. Burke pledged to reinstate Wisconsin’s 2009 Equal Pay Enforcement Act, saying that in Wisconsin, "a woman only earns $0.80 for every dollar a man earns, and pay discrimination doesn't just hurt our families, it hurts our economies too." The former Trek Bicycle executive also sent supporters an email saying that due to Walker’s action, Wisconsin now is "without an equal pay law protecting women from gender discrimination in their paycheck." In bringing up Walker’s repeal of the 2009 law, Burke echoed Democratic Party attacks that Republicans are conducting a "war on women." Is Burke on target in saying that Wisconsin women are working without an anti-discrimination safety net? Before we dive in, we should note that several federal laws give Wisconsin women a way to pursue cases of pay discrimination. It seems clear, though, that Burke was talking about state-level laws that are separate from the federal laws. So that’s what we’ll examine. Burke campaign spokesman Joe Zepecki pointed us to research posted online by the National Conference of State Legislatures, which concluded that Wisconsin, Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Utah lack equal-pay laws. That nugget was picked up by the Washington Post and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in March 2014. How did the group come to that conclusion? The NCSL told us they searched an online legal research service for terms such as "equal pay" and got no hits for Wisconsin. But Wisconsin has a longstanding law by another name, the state Fair Employment Act, which explicitly prohibits gender-based employment discrimination "in promotion (and) compensation paid for equal or substantially similar work." Attorneys on both sides of discrimination cases told us the state’s Fair Employment Act allows people who believe they’ve faced pay discrimination to seek back wages and legal fees from their employers through a state administrative hearing process. So what was the 2009 law passed by Democrats then in full control of the Capitol? That legislation, approved by then-Gov. Jim Doyle, sought to expand the state penalties employers could face if found guilty of discrimination against women and other protected groups on pay or other employment issues. Democrats, women’s professional groups and plaintiff’s lawyers had argued that the Fair Employment law needed more teeth (while Republican opponents said businesses would see more frivolous lawsuits). So the 2009 bill allowed persons to sue in court -- and get compensatory and punitive damages -- after they had exhausted their administrative cases in the state Department of Workforce Development. But that 2009 law -- the one repealed in 2012 by Walker and Republicans -- was a fairly narrow one focused on tougher enforcement of existing protections for women and other groups. It did not establish a new set of equal-pay protections -- those already were in the Fair Employment law, where they have been since 1982 and where they remained even after the 2012 repeal. "The bill will help all workers who are already protected under Wisconsin’s Fair Employment Law to fight these kinds of discrimination," state Rep. Christine Sinicki (D-Milwaukee), a co-sponsor, said in 2009. She added: "The bill does not create any protected new groups, just backs up those who, despite current law, are still unfairly denied work, fired from work or compensated less than others for the same work." All of that history undermines Burke’s sweeping claim. States have changed laws There’s another angle here. It’s tougher on employees to win under Wisconsin law than in some other states where workers can turn to state statutes written more explicitly to require equal pay for equal work, said Janet Heins, managing partner of a Mequon law firm that represents workers. States have adopted those measures in recent years under the heading of "Equal Pay" laws. One result: some states, mirroring federal laws, require only that employees prove unequal pay for equal work instead of showing that employers had a discriminatory motive, said Heins. Ronald Stadler, who defends employers accused of discrimination, agreed but noted that the 2009 Wisconsin law changes did not alter the standard for proving discrimination. Instead, those changes focused on adding remedies such as punitive damages that are already in federal laws. Wisconsin sought in its 2009 "equal pay enforcement" changes to make the state process more appealing and available to employees, in part because its more affordable than filing a federal action. Many state-law claimants proceed without an attorney. In Stadler’s view, the bottom line is that Wisconsin women have a state-law course of action on pay discrimination despite what he called a semantic difference. "We don’t have an ‘equal pay act,’ but we have a ‘fair employment act’ that says you can’t have one male and one female at different pay rates for same job," Stadler, a Milwaukee attorney, said. Heins thinks it’s a "tricky" question to answer, but believes it’s technically accurate to say there’s no state "equal pay" law. Without tougher remedies, some would-be plaintiffs may not be pursuing state claims because it does not make financial sense, Heins said. Burke portrays the 2009 changes as major. But they were repealed before that could be determined, Heins and Stadler said. Heins said that workers’ attorneys may have gained a bit more leverage over employers to settle more cases under the changes. The number of cases that go to state administrative law hearings is not large and most are settled privately, are withdrawn or dismissed for various reasons, according to numbers provided by state Workforce Development officials. In gender pay cases from January 2011 to April 2014 that got to the hearing stage, judges found discrimination in three cases, no discrimination in one and another 33 were settled privately. About 35 other complaints were dismissed, withdrawn or the judges affirmed an earlier finding of no probable cause. Earlier ratings We examined similar statement by Democrats in March 2012 when Republicans were repealing the 2009 change. State Rep. Cory Mason (D-Racine) said the GOP bill would repeal a law that ensures "that women cannot get paid less than a man for doing the same job." We rated that Mostly False, noting the 2009 law did not ensure pay equity, but rather gave discriminated workers the right to sue in state court for compensatory and punitive damages. And we rated False a claim by Kathleen Falk, Democrat running for governor, that Wisconsin women facing pay discrimination "can’t do something about it" under the repeal bill passed by Republicans. We noted that women suffering pay discrimination could still file a state or federal complaint in an effort to be made whole. And they could still seek larger monetary damages by suing in federal court. As for Burke’s claim, there’s a case to be made that Walker’s 2012 action filed down some of the (potentially) sharp new teeth put into the law in 2009. But Burke goes much further, saying that thanks to the governor, Wisconsin is "without an equal pay law." This is highly misleading. Our rating Burke said that Walker’s repeal of a 2009 law has left Wisconsin as "just one of five states without an equal pay law protecting women from gender discrimination in their paycheck." But while Walker reversed an attempt to toughen up Wisconsin law, its protections against gender discrimination in workplace pay date back decades. The governor’s 2012 action left those in place, albeit without tougher penalties for employers. We rate Burke’s claim False.

pomt-01819	"The so-called defense minister of the People's Republic of Donetsk ... actually posted a bragging social media posting of having shot down a military transport. And then when it became apparent it was civilian, they pulled it down from social media."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/20/john-kerry/kerry-ukrainian-separatist-bragged-social-media/	John Kerry made a strong case Sunday tying Ukrainian separatists to the missile that shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. Kerry spoke on all the major networks about what he knows so far about MH 17, the Boeing 777 carrying nearly 300 people that was shot down over eastern Ukraine July 17. The evidence clearly points to Ukraine’s Russian separatists, who have already shot down 12 Ukrainian military planes, he said. Kerry’s cache of evidence included a flow of major weapons (including tanks and rocket launchers) from Russia to the rebels over the past month. And he says the Russians trained the rebels to use an SA-11 missile launcher like the one used to shoot down MH 17. Additionally, an SA-11 passed through the area where the launch originated in the past couple of days, but it did not belong to Ukraine. To top it off, the separatists have implicated themselves, Kerry claimed. Intelligence intercepted conversations among separatists talking about knocking down a plane. And one separatist leader allegedly bragged on social media about shooting down a plane. "We know that very shortly (after the crash), separatists were bragging in the social media about having shot down a transport plane," Kerry said on Fox News Sunday. "We know that the so-called defense minister of the People's Republic of Donetsk, Mr. Igor Strelkov, actually posted a bragging social media posting of having shot down a military transport. And then when it became apparent it was civilian, they pulled it down from social media." While much of Kerry’s evidence relies on intelligence that the public can’t access, we can fact-check his claim that a rebel leader posted on social media about shooting down a plane. We quickly found this screenshot of a post from Strelkov’s social media profile -- allegedly the smoking gun -- that has made its way around the Internet since Thursday: The post has since been deleted. But the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine -- which periodically saves versions of websites -- shows the post did appear on Strelkov’s page at one point, so we know it was it was a real post. But does it indicate that the rebels are behind the attack like Kerry said. First, some background. Who is Igor Strelkov? Igor Strelkov is the rebel commander of Ukraine’s pro-Kremlin forces and an alleged former Russian intelligence agent. His real name is Igor Girkin (Strelkov is Russian for "gunman"), and he’s also called "Igor the Terrible." Strelkov is a shadowy figure. He is a veteran of the Russian military, having fought in post-Soviet conflicts in Transnistria, Serbia and Chechnya, according to the New York Times. Kiev leadership believes Strelkov currently works for Russian military intelligence -- taken by some as proof of Russia’s assistance in the separatist uprising, according to BBC reports. Strelkov last legally crossed into Ukraine from Russia on Feb. 26 of this year. In an interview with the Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda, he admitted to participating in the conflicts in Crimea in the spring and in Slovyansk in April. There, he was named the commander of the rebel forces of the Donetsk People's Republic -- the separatists’ self-proclaimed state in eastern Ukraine. The New York Times describes him as an "iron-fisted" solo operator, who has openly criticized the Kremlin for not providing aid to the rebels. Strelkov wrote for the right-wing Russian nationalist newspaper Zavtra in the 1990s, and he is a war re-enactment enthusiast. Bloggers have discovered photos of him dressed in period military costumes. What do we know about his post? The U.S. State Department confirmed that the post pictured above is the one Kerry was referring to in his statement on Fox. The post comes from Strelkov’s profile on VKontakte (VK), Russia’s version of Facebook. This is a translation of the post, according to the Ukraine Crisis Media Center: 17.07.2014 17:50 (Moscow time) In the region of Torez AN-26 plane has been shot, it is somewhere near the ‘Progress’ mine. We have warned them – not to fly ‘in our sky.’ Here is video-proof of yet another ‘bird fall.’ The bird has fallen behind the (waste heap), it missed the residential quarters. Peaceful citizens were not hurt. The post also included two videos showing some sort of explosion from a distance that are similar to other videos of the MH 17 aftermath. One of the videos is still on YouTube. Supporting the idea that the post was referring to MH 17, it went up at 5:50 p.m. local time, which was about a half hour after MH 17 went down. It says the plane went down in Torez, which is just a few miles south of the MH 17 crash site. The post says, though, that the rebels shot down an AN-26, which is a military transport plane about one-third the length of a Boeing 777. (People in the alleged leaked audio of intercepted conversations also mention confusion over whether the downed plane was a civilian or AN-26.) Separatists had recently shot down at least two transport planes. And the post is no longer on VK -- leading Kerry and others to the conclusion that it was deleted after Strelkov realized that it was a civilian plane, not a transport. But Strelkov denies involvement in the post. In a later VK post, translated for Forbes, Strelkov said the announcement about the transport plane going down was not an official one: "ATTENTION. This announcement declared that the news of the downing of the AN-26 was not official but came from residents and militia members on the scene. The only official announcements are published under the banner: Strelkov INFORMS. In other words, Strelkov asks his readers to forget the earlier announcement of the successful downing of a fascist Ukrainian plane." Later, he posted that Donetsk supports an objective investigation but denies involvement in the missile launch and instead blames the Ukrainian military. Additionally, some separatists in Donetsk told Max Seddon, a BuzzFeed reporter, that Streklov’s VK page is a fake made by fans. But of course, the separatists have an incentive to distance themselves from any evidence tying them to an action that killed 300 civilians. Our ruling Kerry said, "(Strelkov) posted a bragging social media posting of having shot down a military transport. And then when it became apparent it was civilian, they pulled it down from social media." We know that a post appeared on Strelkov’s social media profile bragging about shooting down a transport plane close to the MH 17 crash site. In a subsequent post, Strelkov said the information passed along came not from him directly, but from militia members on the scene. He said the information was unofficial and incorrect. It’s impossible to know with certainty Strelkov's role in the post, or when the post was pulled, but we do know that the posts come from within the separatist movement -- as Strelkov himself said. The evidence is largely on Kerry's side, though there are some points that are unclear. We rate his statement Mostly True.	None	John Kerry	None	None	None	2014-07-20T17:40:05	2014-07-20	['None']
pomt-05555	Says Obama has failed to pass a budget.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/apr/06/mitt-romney/romney-says-obama-failed-pass-budget/	In a speech that looked beyond the primary to the general election, Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, hit President Barack Obama over his handling of the recession. "President Obama's answer to our economic crisis was more spending, more debt and larger government. And by the end of his term in office he will have added nearly as much public debt as all the prior presidents combined," Romney said in an April 4, 2012, speech to newspaper editors. "No president has ever run a trillion-dollar deficit. The new normal the president would have us embrace is trillion-dollar deficits and 8 percent unemployment. Through all of this, President Obama has failed to even pass a budget." There are a lot of accusations packed in there, but that last one -- that Obama failed to pass a budget -- piqued our interest most. How the budget happens The federal budget doesn’t get enacted the way other laws do. The process starts with the president submitting his budget request to Congress early in the year. That voluminous document is partly a presidential wish list, but it also gives Congress a framework. "The ‘PresBud,’ as it is called, forms the basis of the fiscal year budget that starts the following October," according to this post from the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense. In Congress, the House and Senate have budget committees tasked with creating concurrent budget resolutions, using the president’s budget as a guide. As Taxpayers for Common Sense wrote, "The legislation they draft is for Congressional use only: it doesn't go to the President, it isn't law, it just helps Congress keep its budgetary ducks in a row." So there is the first problem with Romney’s statement. The president doesn’t "pass" a budget. That’s Congress’ job. In Obama’s case, he has submitted his budget request each year he has been in office. Voting on his requests Romney said in his speech that "In February, (Obama) put forward a proposal that included the largest tax increase in history and still left our national debt spiraling out of control, and the House rejected it unanimously." He’s right about the rejection. After Obama submitted his fiscal year 2013 budget proposal on Feb. 13, 2012, House Republicans put it up for a floor vote. The result: 414-0 against. The same thing happened a year earlier in the Senate. That vote: 97-0 against. Democrats didn’t support the plan because it has been supplanted by another deficit-reduction plan Obama had later outlined. Republican leaders demanded a vote on Obama’s budget to show that Democrats don’t support any detailed budget blueprint, according to The Hill. Such votes are taken "just as a means of embarrassing the president and his party," said Patrick Louis Knudsen, a senior fellow with the conservative Heritage Foundation. "Usually it’s brought up by the opposition party because they generally anticipate that a president’s budget won’t get very much support especially if it has controversial elements to it," he said. Other experts agree. Said Steve Ellis, of Taxpayers for Common Sense: "That was pure political theater and was done to score rhetorical points." And Norman Ornstein, a scholar with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said, "it doesn’t mean a damn thing. It’s only a symbolic gesture." These votes are also what Romney’s campaign cited when we asked for documentation of his statement. "Everyone understands that the president has a unique and important role in facilitating that process," said spokesman Ryan Williams in an email. "President Obama has been an unprecedented failure in that respect. His FY 2012 budget went down 97-0 in the Senate and his FY 2013 budget went down 414-0 in the House." Speaking of precedent We wondered what other budgetary scenarios have played out recently. Knudsen pointed to 2009, when Democrats still held a majority in the House. They introduced a resolution that included the mechanism for the health care legislation championed by Obama in his budget. The resolution had many elements of the president’s budget, Knudsen said, though it wasn’t strictly speaking that document. Ornstein referred us to the gridlock of 2011 that resulted from the debate over raising the debt ceiling. The budget control act, which was passed to avoid a default on our debt and signed by Obama wasn’t a traditional budget resolution, Ornstein said. But he noted: "That was actually a budget adopted by a president." Ornstein also noted that during George W. Bush’s presidency, there were years that Democrats in Congress failed to pass joint resolutions. "To suggest that was Bush not passing a budget would be a misstatement," Ornstein said. He called Romney’s rap on Obama "at best a gross exaggeration." But in Knudsen’s view, Romney’s statement was "technically accurate." "The president’s budgets have been brought to the floor twice and they have failed," Knudsen said. "It’s not atypical that that should happen, but nevertheless the governor is correct." PolitiFact has examined similar accusations about a lack of budgeting when they’ve been leveled at Congress. In January 2012, Republican House member Paul Ryan charged that Senate Democrats "have gone without any budget at all" for more than 1,000 days. PolitiFact Wisconsin rated that Mostly True, finding he was slightly off about the number of days but correct that the Democrat-controlled Senate had gone a long time with passing a budget resolution. Former Louisiana Congressman and Gov. Buddy Roemer earned a Half True from us when he said in July 2011 that "Obama has never submitted a budget, and Congress has worked for two years without passing one." He was right about Congress but wrong about Obama. Our ruling In his speech, Romney faulted Obama for failing to pass a budget. He was correct that the two times Congress voted on the president’s budget requests, both times they were voted down. But the job of passing a budget resolution is not the president’s. That responsibility falls to Congress, and even then the president doesn’t sign it. As Ellis, our expert, put it: "The president has no role in passing a budget. The president can cajole Congress about passing a budget and advocate for positions and funding levels, but in the end, Congress approves the budget resolution for their own purposes." That’s the difference between this and other claims we’ve rated which blamed Congress for inaction on the budget. Romney’s statement contains a grain of truth, in that two of Obama’s budget requests failed to pass. But citing those votes leaves a wrong impression -- namely that the votes were anything more than political theater. Romney omitted the more critical information that passing a federal budget is the job of Congress. Given all that, we rate his statement Mostly False.

pomt-03048	Domestic violence "is seen as a pre-existing" health condition and "women had to pay 50 percent more for health care because of gender ratings," but under Obamacare, "all of that is over."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/oct/06/gwen-moore/obamacare-stop-domestic-violence-pre-existing-cond/	On Sept. 29, 2013, two days before a political showdown over Obamacare led to a government shutdown, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore defended the health care law. On MSNBC’s "Disrupt with Karen Finney" show, the Milwaukee Democrat described how bad women have had it -- and how things will improve with the Affordable Care Act. She stated: "If you’re a victim of domestic violence, even that’s seen as a pre-existing condition. Women had to pay 50 percent more for health care because of gender rating. All of that is over." So, we need to determine whether being a domestic violence victim is regarded as a pre-existing health condition; and whether women have had to pay 50 percent more for their health care because of "gender rating." We also need to see how the health care law handles domestic violence and gender rating. Pre-existing conditions In 2009, first lady Michelle Obama made a statement similar to the first part of Moore’s claim. She said it was legal in some states to regard domestic violence as a pre-existing condition and use it as a basis for denying health insurance coverage. PolitiFact National rated Obama’s statement True because at the time, eight states permitted treating domestic violence as a pre-existing condition, according to the National Women’s Law Center. The law center told us that its most recent check, in 2010, showed the District of Columbia as well as six states -- Idaho, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Vermont and Wyoming -- had no law prohibiting the insurers from designating domestic violence as a pre-existing condition. However, there were restrictions in some of those states. (The Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health policy research group, also referred us to the law center on this question.) In rating Michelle Obama’s statement, our colleagues pointed out that just because it's legal in some states for insurance companies to cite domestic violence as a pre-existing condition, it doesn't mean insurance companies are actually taking advantage of the loophole. Indeed, an insurer might deny a woman coverage based on an injury or condition without it being disclosed that the injury or condition was a result of domestic violence. There was evidence in the 1990s that using domestic violence to deny coverage was widespread, but the law center told us it is not aware of any data on how many insurance companies actually use domestic violence now as a pre-existing condition. Beginning on Jan. 1, 2014, the Affordable Care Act will prohibit insurance companies from denying coverage to people who already have health problems, such as high blood pressure, depression or diabetes, as well as "conditions arising out of domestic violence." So, while there isn’t evidence that health insurers commonly use domestic violence as a pre-existing condition to deny coverage, it is "seen" as such in that it is legal in a handful of states for health insurers to do so. Moore is also correct that practice is being outlawed under Obamacare. "Gender rating" The second part of Moore’s claim is that women have had to pay 50 percent more for their health care because of "gender rating." There’s no dispute that health insurers use gender as one factor in setting rates; others include age, family size, geographic region and health status. But Moore’s broad claim that women pay 50 percent higher rates isn’t so clear. Moore cited a March 2012 report, again from the National Women’s Law Center. The center said it used the eHealthInsurance website to calculate premiums in the individual market -- in other words, premiums for women who purchase health insurance themselves, rather than getting it through their employer or spouse. The individual market is a key target of the Affordable Care Act. The center said premiums were at least 50 percent higher for women than for men in a number of instances, including health plans for 25-year-olds in Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Virginia and Wyoming; and for 40-year-olds in Alabama, Arizona, Kansas and Kentucky. Although federal anti-discrimination protections enacted prior to the Affordable Care Act generally prohibit employers from charging female employees higher premiums than male employees, businesses with predominantly female workforces are routinely charged more for group coverage, according to the law center. The reform law prohibits gender rating, beginning Jan. 1, 2014. So, there is evidence that some women buying health insurance in the individual market, a key target of Obamacare, are charged 50 percent more than men for the same coverage. Such gender rating is made illegal under the health reform law. Our rating Moore said domestic violence "is seen as a pre-existing" health condition and "women had to pay 50 percent more for health care because of gender ratings," but under Obamacare, "all of that is over." The thrust of what Moore said is partially accurate, in that there is some evidence to back the pre-existing condition and 50 percent parts of her claim. She’s correct that the Affordable Care Act eliminates the treatment of domestic violence as a pre-existing condition and eliminates gender rating. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, we give Moore a Half True. If you would like to comment on this item, you can do so on the Journal Sentinel’s web page.

pomt-13779	"It was Hillary Clinton who left Americans in harm's way in Benghazi and after four Americans fell said, 'What difference at this point does it make?' "	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/21/mike-pence/mike-pences-false-claim-about-clintons-role-and-re/	Indiana Gov. Mike Pence officially accepted the GOP’s nomination for vice president July 21, 2016, in Cleveland, and didn’t miss a beat when it came to assailing Hillary Clinton. "It was Hillary Clinton who left Americans in harm's way in Benghazi and after four Americans fell said, 'What difference at this point does it make?' " Pence said, eliciting loud boos from the audience. We’ve heard a version of this attack several times at the Republican National Convention, with some versions more accurate than others. Both parts of this particular claim are inaccurate. There is no evidence showing Clinton personally "left Americans in harm’s way in Benghazi." And while he’s using Clinton words, he’s misattributing their meaning. Leaving Americans ‘in harm’s way’ We reached out to the Trump campaign to clarify what Pence meant by Clinton leaving "Americans in harm’s way" but didn’t hear back immediately. It could refer to her alleged inaction after the attacks in sending troops to the scene. Or, to her allegedly brushing off requests for more security at the Benghazi compound. Or, her "sleeping through" the attacks. No matter, all of these claims are inaccurate -- some more so than others. Let’s take a look one by one. Before he officially got the job, Pence knocked Clinton for taking "13 hours to send help to Americans under fire." We rated that False. Clinton was not responsible for sending help to Benghazi; that fell to military officials. The Defense Department attempted to send help to the scene, but was unable to reach Benghazi before the deaths occurred. Others have accused Clinton of ignoring requests for more security for the Benghazi consulate. It’s undeniable that officials in Libya repeatedly asked for better security, but there’s no evidence that Clinton herself was aware or that she willfully denied them. And finally, Pence may have been making his running mate’s point that the Benghazi victims were "left helpless to die as Hillary Clinton soundly slept in her bed." That’s also False. Clinton was not literally sleeping when the attacks unfolded, as it was mid afternoon in Washington. Emails show she worked late into the night. Taking Trump’s and Pence’s claim more broadly, was Clinton inattentive as the attacks unfolded? In its recently released report, the House select committee on Benghazi did conclude that there were State Department and overall administrative failings, but Pence and Trump blamed Clinton specifically. And neither that probe nor the seven congressional investigations before it have suggested Clinton was personally responsible or could have prevented the attack. Clinton, for her part, has accepted responsibility for the attack as the head of the State Department at the time. ‘What difference at this point does it make?’ Pence’s claim that she made this oft-repeated comment in response "after four Americans fell" is also inaccurate. Clinton’s comments, said during a hearing months after the attack, was not an expression of apathy over the deaths.It was an exasperated response to Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., pressing Clinton on why State Department officials in Washington didn’t call their counterparts in Libya to determine the cause of the attack (protests over a video mocking Islam or a planned terrorist attack). Clinton told Johnson her priority was figuring out how to rescue them, not pressing them for information, and it wasn’t appropriate to talk to the them before FBI interviews. When Johnson continued to press her for a more straightforward answer, Clinton gave her exasperated answer. "With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they’d they go kill some Americans? What difference, at this point, does it make?" she said. (You can read the full six-minute transcript here, courtesy of PolitiFact Wisconsin.) Our ruling Pence said, "It was Hillary Clinton who left Americans in harm's way in Benghazi and after four Americans fell said, 'What difference at this point does it make?' " It’s reasonable to argue that Clinton, as head of the State Department, should shoulder some responsibility for the bureaucratic failures that may have contributed to the tragedy. But there’s no evidence that suggests, as Pence does, that Clinton was personally responsible for or could have prevented the deaths of the four Benghazi victims. As for Clinton’s comment, it did not come "after four Americans fell," but in a subsequent congressional hearing. She was responding to a senator’s repeated questioning over why she didn’t call department workers in Benghazi to figure out the cause of the attack, not to the fact that four Americans had died.

pomt-10403	"John McCain decided to stand with George Bush 95 percent of the time (last year)."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/04/barack-obama/thats-what-the-votes-show-yes/	Sharpening his attack line that electing Sen. John McCain is the equivalent of giving President Bush a third term, Sen. Barack Obama used his triumphant speech in St. Paul, Minn. June 3, 2008, in which he finally claimed the Democratic nomination, to note that his Republican rival voted with the commander-in-chief 95 percent of the time last year. "It's not change when John McCain decided to stand with George Bush 95 percent of the time, as he did in the Senate last year," Obama said. The number Obama cited didn't come out of thin air. It reflects McCain's 2007 "presidential support" score from Congressional Quarterly, part of a carefully measured and widely cited series of vote studies that demonstrate how often lawmakers back or oppose the president, as well as the majority of their parties. But while Obama may be accurately quoting the CQ analysis of 2007, he's selectively picking facts while not telling the entire story. McCain's 95 percent score was the high-water mark of his presidential support during President Bush's tenure, and was partly a reflection of the new political calculus in the Democratic-controlled Congress. McCain supported Bush as infrequently as 77 percent of the time in 2005, and backed the president's position an average of 89 percent of the time since 2001. By congressional standards, that's solidly partisan, but hardly marching in lockstep. The 2007 votes reflected the Senate agenda after Democrats gained a one-vote majority in the chamber in the 2006 mid-term elections. Bush stated a position on 97 roll call votes and won 64 of them — a 66 percent success rate. Deduct the 29 Senate votes to confirm Bush nominees to executive branch positions or judgeships, and the president's success rate fell to just over 51 percent. But while he had a terrible year on paper, Bush was the winner on critical votes on spending limits, taxes and energy policy, thanks to unified support from Republicans. Because Senate rules require 60 votes to end prolonged debate or a filibuster, Republicans repeatedly used the stalling tactic to stop initiatives on the Democrats' agenda. The Senate voted 18 times last year on motions to cut off debate and end filibusters that Bush was on record as supporting. He prevailed 17 times. McCain missed more than half the votes on which Bush had a position, as he campaigned for the White House. But repeated votes on immigration and the Iraq war — two issues on which he was closely allied with Bush — as well as the filibuster votes helped elevate McCain from one of the president's chief adversaries three years ago to one of his biggest supporters. McCain's vote score can thus be viewed both as a reflection of ideological kinship with the Bush administration and with the hard-line, tactical decisions he made in response to some Democratic initiatives. Because Obama correctly quotes an accurate measure of how often McCain was in sync with the president in 2007, we rule the claim True.

pomt-15137	Bernie Sanders opposes the death penalty, and Hillary Clinton supports it.	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2015/sep/02/viral-image/where-do-hillary-clinton-and-bernie-sanders-stand-/	An image circulating on Twitter and Reddit claims Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have opposing views on a host of issues, including the death penalty. According to the image, Sanders opposes the death penalty, but Clinton supports it. We wanted to see if the two candidates disagree on capital punishment. (See our other checks on the image here.) Sanders and the death penalty The Vermont senator has been an opponent of the death penalty for his entire political career. And with one exception, he has voted against expansions of the death penalty at every turn. Sanders opposed the Violent Crime Prevention Act of 1991 during his first year in the U.S. House of Representatives. "All over the industrialized world now, countries are saying, ‘let us put an end to state murder, let us stop capital punishment’," Sanders said in a 1991 speech on the House floor. "But here what we’re talking about is more and more capital punishment." The bill, which included provisions to authorize the death penalty as appropriate punishment for crimes involving the murder of a law enforcement officer, terrorism and drug trafficking, never reached the desk of President George H.W. Bush. In 1994, however, Sanders voted in favor of the final version of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, a bill that expanded the federal death penalty. Sanders had voted for an amendment to the bill that would have replaced all federal death sentences with life in prison. Even though the amendment failed, Sanders still voted for the larger crime bill. A spokesman for Sanders said he voted for the bill "because it included the Violence Against Women Act and the ban on certain assault weapons." Sanders reiterated his opposition to capital punishment in 2015. "I just don’t think the state itself, whether it’s the state government or federal government, should be in the business of killing people," he said on a radio show. Clinton and the death penalty Clinton’s campaign did not provide her stance on capital punishment. The last time she publicly addressed capital punishment, which was 15 years ago, Clinton offered support. In her 2000 run for U.S. Senate, she was quoted by a Washington Post columnist as saying the death penalty had her "unenthusiastic support." Clinton’s history on the issue, however, is slightly complicated. As director of the legal aid clinic at the University of Arkansas in the 1970s, Clinton helped to get the death sentence of a 20-year-old African-American man sentenced to life in prison. But according to a timeline of the case compiled by the Marshall Project, a nonprofit news organization that focuses on criminal justice, Clinton’s views on the topic changed as her husband’s did. Bill Clinton, then governor of Arkansas, is described as shifting his position on the death penalty as part of an effort to present himself as a centrist "New Democrat" in the 1980s. Citing Paul Kengor’s 2007 book God and Hillary Clinton: A Spiritual Life, the timeline says that Hillary Clinton " ‘agonized’ over her husband’s embrace of capital punishment," eventually supporting it. As first lady, she supported the 1994 crime bill that Sanders opposed. After her election to U.S. Senate, she co-sponsored a bill that made it easier for prisoners on death row to appeal for exoneration through DNA testing. Clinton hasn’t yet addressed the issue in the 2016 election cycle. Our ruling The infographic claims Bernie Sanders opposes the death penalty and that Hillary Clinton supports it. Sanders has opposed the death penalty for at least the last 20 years, though he did vote for the 1994 crime bill that, among many other provisions, expanded the number of crimes that could result in death penalty sentences. While Clinton has helped make it easier to appeal a death sentence, her most recent documented statements on the topic expressed tepid support. Without a clear idea of her most recent stance, we can only assume she still holds that position. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-13412	Says Donald Trump has outlined "policies that read like a Kremlin wish list."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/22/michael-morell/experts-say-donald-trumps-policies-dovetail-what-v/	Concerned by Donald Trump's secrecy about his dealings with other countries, 55 former government, military and national security officials — Democrats and some Republicans — have signed a letter urging him to reveal his international business relationships and foreign investments, and to pledge to divest himself of all overseas business interests if he wins the presidency. The letter was drafted in part by Michael Morell, former acting director and deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency. It says that the limited amount of information available to the public — Trump has refused to release his tax returns — suggests business relationships that "would be problematic" and might influence his policy positions as president, particularly when it comes to Russia. "On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump has repeatedly praised Vladimir Putin’s authoritarian leadership, while outlining policies that read like a Kremlin wish list. He has claimed that Putin would never invade Ukraine, suggested permanently ceding Crimea to Russia, and placed conditions on upholding our obligation to protect our NATO allies. He even encouraged Russian espionage to interfere with our election, a tactic Putin has deployed across Central Asia and Europe to boost his preferred candidates. In addition, he has floated lifting sanctions against Russia, which would benefit both Putin and the Trump Organization." For this fact-check, we were interested in whether Trump has outlined "policies that read like a Kremlin wish list." We talked to Russia experts who signed the letter as well as those who didn't. We emailed several people in the Trump campaign asking for reaction and information to dispute the assertion. We received no reply. We contacted Morell and more than a half dozen of the signers to get details on the claim. Their focus is on the issues mentioned in the letter: NATO, Ukraine and the lack of support for economic sanctions against Russia. Let's review them separately. NATO: In July, Trump told the New York Times that he wouldn't automatically come to the defense of a NATO ally that hasn't paid its expected contribution. "I would be absolutely prepared to tell those countries, 'Congratulations, you will be defending yourself,' " he said. NATO was created as deterrent to the former Soviet Union, of which Russia was the key player. Putin has strongly objected to attempts to expand NATO because of Russian security concerns, so anything that weakens NATO could strengthen Russia. "This is exactly what Putin wants — to sow the seeds of doubt in those countries on his periphery over whether the West will be there for them," Morell told us in an email. "This kind of talk forces those states to be more accommodating to Russian interests." Trump's potential unwillingness to defend NATO members who don't contribute enough financially to the alliance is "essentially undermining unconditional nature of our commitment to their defense," said a cosigner of the letter, Richard Nephew, a former principal deputy coordinator of sanctions policy for the State Department who is now at Columbia University. Crimea and Ukraine: Russia annexed Crimea, and Putin supported an uprising in eastern Ukraine, sending in fighters after a revolution removed a pro-Russian president in 2014. Putin said annexation was morally and legally justified. The United States and the European Union disagreed. Trump had a different attitude. "The people of Crimea, from what I've heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were," he said in a July 31 interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos. He also called Putin’s grab "so smart" in an April 12, 2014 Fox News interview. As PolitiFact reported in August, Trump’s comments actually echo the official Kremlin position that Crimea is now Russian and its citizens prefer it that way. "Trump has sided with Putin on all these issues," said Samantha Vinograd, another co-signer and former director for international affairs and Iraq at the National Security Council. "If you look at how Trump will not condemn Russia's military takeover of Crimea, that's something that literally Putin was probably jumping up and down over when he said that." "This lets Putin off the hook for the first land grab in Europe since World War II," said Morell. "That gift to Putin even has a bow on it." Sanctions against Russia: The European Union and the United States responded to the situation in Ukraine by issuing sanctions against Russia. They affect Russian banks, arms makers and energy companies, and have both limited Russia's access to Western markets and hindered its ability to deal with a recession caused by the sharp drop in oil prices. Clearly, Russia would like to see those sanctions lifted. Trump has said he would consider removing them. "That undermines sanctions as a tool," said Vinograd. "You don't just remove them without proof that a country has met its international obligations." What other Russia experts say Experts we consulted who didn't sign the letter agreed that many of Trump's comments line up with actions that Putin would probably like to see. "I think Trump's foreign policy is the most pro-Russian policy we've seen from a major presidential candidate, at least since World War II," said Matthew Kroenig, associate professor at Georgetown University and a senior advisor on the Marco Rubio campaign who signed an anti-Trump letter last spring. "With talk of tearing up NATO and positive talk about President Putin, it seems to be a very sympathetic Russian foreign policy," "Putin and the Russians would be delighted to see him elected," Kroenig added. "To be more supportive of the Kremlin, Trump would have to scrap America's nuclear arsenal and sign a treaty to give the Ukraine back to Russia." Michael McFaul, who served as U.S. ambassador to Russia from 2012 to 2014, made additional points in an Aug. 17, 2016, Washington Post commentary. For example, a political battle over building a wall on the Mexican border, would be a major distraction in this country and "a United States convulsed by infighting over Trump's deeply divisive policy proposals gives Putin more freedom to act around the world." But Peter Feaver, a professor of political science and public policy at Duke University, said the claim that Trump's policies read like a Kremlin wish list is "hyperbole to be sure, because it's looking at some of Trump's statements and not others." For example, the candidate's pledge to reinvigorate the United States military would not be part of a Russian wish list. He said the idea that NATO allies aren't paying their fair share for the defense of Europe is a longstanding United States complaint. It's just that Trump is the first to threaten to take action by not defending a country that's attacked but is not paying. "And he described the situation in Crimea and Eastern Ukraine in a way that was favorable to Russia's interpretation of what's happening," said Feaver. "So I wouldn't say his comments are are on the Kremlin's wish list, but they were certainly reinforcing Putin's approach and undermining NATO, which is a way of achieving one of Putin's goals, which is to weaken NATO." He also cautioned that it can be hard to tell what Trump really thinks, given all the things he says in off-the-cuff remarks. Only the other hand, he noted, Trump seldom backtracks on an outrageous statement he's made. The claim that Trump's policies read like a Kremlin wish list "has a lot more to do with Donald Trump's overall statements about Russia than it does with any concrete policies, and that's because Donald Trump doesn't really have many concrete policies," said Emma Ashford, a defense and foreign policy research fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute. "Trump tends to be quite inconsistent on a lot of things" such as working with Russia to fight ISIS," she said. "So with Donald Trump's inconsistency, it's really really hard to tell what he would do on some of these issues." Our ruling Morell and others said Trump has outlined "policies that read like a Kremlin wish list." Trumps comments on backing away from NATO, supporting Russia on the Ukraine and rethinking sanctions against Russia certainly qualify as statements that dovetail with what the Putin administration would like. But not all of his opinions, such as wanting to increase military spending, are in lockstep with policies the Kremlin might favor.

pomt-09008	"Sen. McConnell offered a fully paid two-month extension of unemployment insurance."	true	/texas/statements/2010/jul/11/john-cornyn/mcconnell-proposed-extending-unemployment-benefits/	Haggling over extending unemployment insurance to the nation’s jobless ended in a deadlock last week when Senate Democrats couldn’t secure one additional vote to prevent a Republican filibuster. The next day, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas advised that Republicans are not against extending such benefits. They just want the benefits to be paid for first, he said, instead of adding the costs to the federal deficit. "Sen. (Mitch) McConnell offered a fully paid two-month extension of unemployment insurance," Cornyn told Texas reporters during a July 1 conference call. McConnell is the GOP leader in the Senate. Mindful the nation’s unemployment rate hasn’t slipped below 9 percent in more than a year — it was 9.5 percent in June — we decided to investigate. First, some background: Since it was created in 1935, the unemployment insurance system has helped the jobless by replacing part of their lost income for up to 26 weeks. Though supervised by the federal government, the program is run by the states, which provide most funding through employer taxes. In 1970, Congress created the permanent Extended Benefits program, which provides an additional 13 or 20 weeks to former employees who have exhausted their 26 weeks of regular benefits in states where unemployment has worsened. On top of that, Congress regularly extends unemployment benefits during serious economic downturns. Most recently, in June 2008, Congress created the Emergency Unemployment Compensation program so workers who had exhausted state unemployment benefits could receive up to 34 weeks of additional benefits — and workers in states with high unemployment rates qualified for or up to 53 weeks of additional aid. As of May 2010, Nevada had the highest unemployment rate in the country at 14 percent, followed by Michigan (13.6 percent) and California (12.4). Texas’ unemployment rate stayed steady from April at 8.3 percent, while North Dakota had the lowest rate: 3.6 percent. Experts we spoke with from across the political spectrum couldn’t recall an instance when extensions during recessions were funded up front. Why not? Gary Burtless, an economist at the liberal-leaning Brookings Institution and formerly of the U.S. Department of Labor, said unemployment rates 7 percent or more are almost always considered emergencies — "that is, serious recessions for which a major federal response is considered appropriate." Emergency expenditures can add to the deficit because Congress can approve them without offsetting the costs with spending cuts or revenue increases. Congress and the sitting administration have approved unemployment benefit extensions in every recession since the late 1950s, Burtless said. The Senate majority leader, Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said on the Senate floor June 30: "We, as a Congress — Democrats and Republicans — have always extended unemployment benefits because it is an emergency. President Reagan did it for almost three years. President Bush did it for a couple of years. It has been going on on a bipartisan basis when times are tough in America." Norman Ornstein, a congressional expert and resident scholar at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, told us that while such extensions temporarily contribute to deficits, they’re usually one-time expenditures, as opposed to spending that "continues into perpetuity or creates a policy that adds to spending over the longer term." "Generally speaking, when you hit a downturn, you want to have deficits that spur your economy," he said. "But most states, of course, have balanced-budget amendments, so they provide a fiscal drag... the only place you can turn is the federal government." Case in point: In February 2009, President Barack Obama signed the stimulus act, which extended through 2009 emergency unemployment insurance. Congress subsequently extended benefits in November, December, March and most recently in April, with an $18 billion bill extending benefits until June 2. Each time, the legislation wasn’t offset with tax revenue or spending cuts — a sticking point for most Republicans. In February, Sen. Jim Bunning, R-Ky., initially refused to allow the Senate to consider a House measure to extend benefits for 30 days because it wasn’t offset with other savings. The deficit is on the rise. In its analysis of Obama’s budget for fiscal 2011, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office predicted annual deficits would pile up, totaling $9.8 trillion by 2020. Which almost brings us back to now. From June 18 through June 30, Senate Democrats failed to secure enough votes to extend unemployment benefits while increasing the deficit. Reid ultimately fell a vote short of the 60 votes needed to block a filibuster on an amendment that would have extended unemployment benefits through Nov. 30, retroactive to June 2, the expiration date for the previously extended benefits. The Congressional Budget Office projected the blocked extension would cost $33.9 billion through 2020. Republicans said they would support extending benefits if they were paid for up front. And on June 30, McConnell, the minority leader, proposed a two-month extension — rather than the Democratic-backed extension through November — that he said reduced the deficit by $1.7 billion. How? By adjusting Medicaid payments, trimming stimulus-funded food stamps in 2014, cutting $600 million in stimulus-supported programs to expand broadband Internet access and eliminating a provision letting qualified residents receive their earned-income tax credit throughout the year instead at the end of the tax filing season. "We cannot support job-killing taxes and adding tens of billions to the already unsustainable national debt," McConnell said on the floor June 30. "If the Democrats object to extending these programs using their own stimulus offset to pay for them, then they will be saying loudly and clearly that their commitment to deficit spending trumps their desire to help the unemployed." Democrats rejected McConnell’s proposal, saying that the stimulus money would be needed elsewhere to boost job growth. Thomas Mann, a congressional scholar at Brookings, said that in the past, it was broadly accepted that additional spending on unemployment benefits during a serious economic downturn wasn’t harmful to the economy. Similarly, most of the funding during the last eight years for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan was treated as emergency spending and not included in the regular budget, he said. In 2005, for example, Congress approved Bush’s request for $51.8 billion in emergency spending — $1.4 billion to the military, $400 million to the Army Corps of Engineers, and $50 billion to "disaster relief’ (the legislation came in the wake of Hurricane Katrina). Summing up: Of late, congressional efforts to extend unemployment insurance benefits have failed — including McConnell's proposal to finance an extension by paying for it with stimulus funding. We rate Cornyn's statement as True.	None	John Cornyn	None	None	None	2010-07-11T13:20:48	2010-07-01	['None']
pomt-09119	"The minute this proposal for near-beach oil drilling came up, I was against it."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/jun/17/alex-sink/sink-says-she-opposed-drilling-minute-it-was-propo/	Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink, a Democratic candidate for governor, has been a vocal critic of offshore drilling in the aftermath of the Gulf oil spill. In a speech to the Suncoast Tiger Bay Club in Clearwater on June 10, 2010, Sink responded to a question about how she would handle the crisis as governor: "Clearly we are in uncharted territory here because while other parts of the world have been subject to oil spills, and by the way, the minute this proposal for near-beach oil drilling came up, I was against it, and that's why I support a constitutional amendment for the people of Florida to be able to say never will we have drilling within 3 miles of our shore." We were struck by Sink's claim that she opposed a proposal for near-beach oil drilling "the minute" it came up. Did she? It was spring 2009 when a group of Republican lawmakers, in the waning days of Florida's legislative session, advanced a proposal to allow offshore oil drilling in state waters, 3 to 10 miles off Florida's coasts. A bill related to developing a plan to implement oil drilling was proposed on Feb. 26, 2009, but it didn't evolve into an actual push to allow drilling until April 21. That's when state Rep. Dean Cannon advocated for a measure to allow applications to the Florida Cabinet to open up drilling. At Cannon's urging, the House Policy Council passed the bill 17-6 on April 21. The bill represented a reversal of the longstanding ban on oil drilling in state waters. But a massive budget deficit encouraged some lawmakers to support the change, which would have allowed the state to charge $1 million per application. If the Cabinet gave the go-ahead for exploration, companies would have had to post a $500 million bond. Environmentalists protested. "Florida's beaches are our legacy and to put them at risk for a few million dollars makes no sense," Eric Draper of the Florida Audubon Society told the Miami Herald. "One small oil spill could wipe out billions of dollars of economic activities. This is gambling with Florida's future." U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson tweeted his dismay. "I can't believe some Florida lawmakers might actually be serious about allowing oil drilling within 10 miles offshore," he wrote on April 21. So what about Sink? An April 22, 2009, article by the Associated Press quotes Sink as being upset that the issue surfaced so late in the session, but her opposition isn't apparent. "I thought we were supposed to have government in the sunshine, this is government in the middle of the night," Sink said. "We have to have open, rigorous debate, and real time to hear from Florida's citizens about this 11th-hour change that could bring drilling rigs just 3 miles off Florida's coastline in the shallow waters of the Gulf." Sink spokesman Kyra Jennings pointed us to an April 24 press release in which Sink opposed the proposed bill -- three days after the House Policy Council voted for it. "As Florida’s Chief Financial Officer it is my responsibility to protect the people of Florida and all state owned land, and I take these obligations very seriously," Sink wrote. "That's why I strongly oppose the near-shore drilling legislation, which would threaten Florida’s economy by bringing oil rigs 3 miles off our coast, sanctioning drilling in the shallow waters of the Gulf, and allowing unlimited pipelines to go through sensitive areas up to our beaches. This controversial near-shore drilling bill puts Florida's billion dollar tourism, fishery, and marina-related industries at serious risk, and is not in the best interest of Florida." As a member of the state Cabinet, Sink's opinion was relevant because the bill would have given the Cabinet authority to accept applications for drilling. Sink was one of many Democratic politicians to voice opposition. On April 27, the House approved HB 1219 on a 70-43 vote, but the Senate put the brakes on it because the issue surfaced near the end of the session. A similar proposal was suggested for the 2010 session, but the April 20 Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion sunk all efforts. Even before the 2009 legislative session, Sink was critical of drilling near Florida's coasts. She joined several Democrats in 2008 responding to Gov. Charlie Crist's comments that oil drilling would reduce gas prices. "The future is not in destroying our coast," she said. "We need long-term solutions now.'' Earlier this year, when Obama sought to lift the federal ban on drilling off Florida's west coast -- which would still keep rigs 125 miles away -- Sink issued this response March 31, 2010: "While I support additional offshore exploration 125 miles from Florida's coasts, I have long been opposed to the near-beach drilling proposal currently in the Florida legislature that puts our tourism economy at risk. Florida depends on our tourism, fishery, and marina industries and having oil rigs in sight, pipes on our beaches and the potential of a spill would threaten our state's economic well-being. It's extremely important to ensure that any drilling will not impact Florida's $65 billion tourism industry or interfere with the important work of Florida's military bases, both of which are vital to our state's economy." After the Gulf oil spill, she joined other officials in calling for a permanent ban near Florida's shores. "I have seen the BP oil spill up close, spreading for miles," Sink said. "This evidence proves that near-beach drilling in Florida is a disastrous idea. We must never let oil companies drill just 3 miles off our beaches." It's clear Sink is opposed to drilling off Florida's coast, but she said in her statement that she opposed the idea "the minute" was floated in 2009. In a press release, she spoke out against the proposal three days after the House Policy Council voted for it -- and three days before the full House voted on it. Because she was so specific with her words, we have to be specific, too. Three days after a vote is not "the minute," despite her 2008 opposition. Sen. Nelson tweeted about it that very day. So we rate her claim Half True.	None	Alex Sink	None	None	None	2010-06-17T13:49:04	2010-06-10	['None']
pomt-01004	Science is "very certain" that the measles vaccine doesn't cause autism.	true	/punditfact/statements/2015/feb/03/megyn-kelly/foxs-kelly-science-measles-vaccine-safety-certain-/	As the number of cases of measles slowly grows across the United States, it has revived a past debate over the safety of the vaccine that for decades prevented an outbreak. Potential presidential contenders, including Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, have suggested that parents should be allowed to decline vaccination for their children if they have concerns over side effects. Two Fox News hosts, Bill O’Reilly and Megyn Kelly, tackled the touchy topic of mandatory vaccinations on The O’Reilly Factor on Feb. 2, 2015. Kelly said she had all three of her children vaccinated and that for immunization programs to work, they must be mandatory. Kelly, however, cut some slack for parents who might have decided otherwise a few years ago. "They were given bad information years ago by a U.K. study that came out in 1998," Kelly said. "Five years ago the science wasn't even as certain as it is today. It is very certain today." In this fact-check, we take a look at the scientific certainty over the safety of vaccination. Along the way, we’ll see if the science has become even more certain in the past five years. We told Fox News we were digging into this and didn’t hear back, but Kelly’s five-year mark lines up with the formal retraction of that United Kingdom study she mentioned. To quickly recap, in 1998, a British medical journal called the Lancet published a paper by Andrew Wakefield and a dozen colleagues that claimed to show a link between the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine and autism. Many parents responded with predictable fear and vaccination rates began falling. The impact was strongest in the United Kingdom where the rate fell from the 90 percent range down to 80 percent. The United States saw a minor dip. In some states, the rate dropped below 90 percent although nationally the rate remained higher. In 2010, roughly five years ago, the Lancet retracted Wakefield’s study. This seems to be the benchmark for Kelly’s comparison. What we heard from the public health community is that not only is the medical science clear today, it was back in 2010 as well. The scientists were sure Dr. Mark Schleiss is director of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at the University of Minnesota Medical School. Schleiss told PunditFact that the science was clear in 2010, and it’s clear today. "Wakefield's work had been discredited within a year or two of publication," Schleiss said. "After Wakefield, there were a number of other studies performed, and it was convincingly shown that there was no link with autism, but that safety information was already known well before that." Schleiss dates efforts to test the safety of childhood immunizations back to the 1980s when there were reports that the whooping cough vaccine caused developmental disorders. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Institute of Medicine (at the time, a division of the National Academy of Sciences) conducted studies and found the whooping cough reports without merit. Along the way, that work also established the safety of the MMR vaccine and would undermine Wakefield’s research in the Lancet. The Wakefield study had such a high profile that it spurred further rounds of research. In 2001, the Institute of Medicine published a report that found no evidence of an association between the vaccine and autism. In 2004, the institute conducted another review. The institute said in a press release, "14 large epidemiological studies consistently showed no association between the MMR vaccine and autism." Dr. Marie McCormick, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, oversaw the committee that conducted the 2004 IOM vaccine safety review. McCormick told us that there were no divisions within the scientific community at that time. "I think that the data were pretty firm as of 2004," McCormick said. By 2004, 10 of Wakefield’s co-authors had withdrawn their names from his study. Other things also had happened. Brian Deer, a British journalist, documented shoddy data that underlay the results. Deer also found that Wakefield never disclosed that he had been paid by a lawyer representing some of the children cited in the article. In the British Medical Journal, Deer later exposed how Wakefield engaged in an elaborate scientific fraud. Wakefield sued the British Medical Journal and lost. Editor-in-chief Fiona Godlee told PunditFact that "the science has been much the same throughout the MMR scare caused by Wakefield's paper." McCormick said the one thing that did change over the years was the public reporting around the topic. At the height of the scare, McCormick said news coverage suffered from a systematic flaw. "If a reporter interviewed a scientist about the results, she would almost automatically give equal time and weight to an opponent of vaccines regardless of the validity of their opinion," McCormick said. "Thus, to the viewer or reader, the issue would seem evenly balanced, even when it was not." Our ruling Kelly said that the science on vaccine safety is certain today. The researchers we contacted said that as far as the science is concerned, certainty had been reached at least 10 years ago with the release of a major national study debunking the link between the measles mumps, rubella vaccine and autism. Five years ago, the British journal the Lancet retracted the original report that triggered the initial wave of fear. That decision was the final nail in the coffin of a discredited report. If anything, Kelly undersold her point about when scientists agreed that vaccination is safe. We rate the claim True.	None	Megyn Kelly	None	None	None	2015-02-03T18:04:48	2015-02-02	['None']
pomt-14935	Paul Ryan "is one of only six House Republicans who voted for Teddy Kennedy's bill to force Christian employers to hire LGBT employees."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/oct/28/constitutional-rights-pac/paul-ryan-one-few-gop-vote-force-christian-employe/	Even if by one measure he is the most conservative Speaker in decades, the idea of Paul Ryan leading the U.S. House of Representatives is an abomination to some on the right. That was evident on Oct. 14, 2015, more than two weeks before the Wisconsin Republican’s colleagues elected him speaker. A conservative political action committee issued a news release announcing its "Fire Paul Ryan" campaign. The release from the Constitutional Rights PAC made a number of attacks on Ryan, including one about lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people. "Paul Ryan would be the most liberal, pro-union, Republican speaker in history," said the release, quoting North Carolina Republican Kay Daly, who is running against a GOP incumbent for Congress. "He is one of only six House Republicans who voted for Teddy Kennedy’s bill to force Christian employers to hire LGBT employees. Even John Boehner never did that!" As we’ll see, there are problems with each part of the claim. Ryan’s vote The Constitutional Rights PAC, based outside of Washington, D.C., says it "exists to advocate constitutional governance and remind elected servants of the oaths they swore to uphold." The PAC takes credit for forcing Boehner, Ryan’s predecessor, to resign, and it ran a "Fire Kevin McCarthy" campaign before the California Republican unexpectedly dropped his bid to be speaker. The PAC’s attack on Ryan is in reference to the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, known as ENDA, which aims to prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. It has been introduced a number of times, beginning in 1994, but has never become law. The late U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., was the main sponsor of the 1996 version of ENDA. The measure died after failing in the Senate on a 50-49 vote. So, there was no House vote on the Kennedy bill. Moreover, Ryan wasn’t elected to the House until 1998, two years later. A 2007 version of ENDA did pass the House, 235-184. There was never a vote in the Senate. According to a New Yorker article on the history of ENDA legislation, the measure died because it did not include protection for transgendered persons. Ryan voted yes on that measure. "They didn’t roll out of bed one morning and choose to be gay. That’s who they are," he once said, acknowledging he "took a lot of grief" for the ENDA vote from fellow Republicans. The Constitutional Rights PAC, in its original news release, said Ryan was one of only six GOP House members who voted yes. That’s wrong. The release was later revised to say 10. But even that count is misleading, in that it only refers only to Republican House members who voted yes on the 2007 bill and are still in the House. As we noted, Ryan was among a total of 35 GOP House members who voted yes. Ten are still in the House, plus two others who voted yes are now in the Senate. The bill The thrust of the PAC’s claim is that the bill Ryan backed would have forced Christian employers to hire people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. That part of the claim is in error in that the bill did not include transgender people. And the "force" part of the claim, particularly as it applies to "Christian employers," goes too far. The bill would have prohibited employers of 15 or more persons from discriminating in employment -- including hiring, firing and compensation -- on the basis of actual or perceived sexual orientation. At the same time, it would have prohibited the adoption of quotas or granting preferential treatment to an individual based on their sexual orientation. What’s more, the bill had a religious exemption. For example, it did not apply to a "religious corporation, association, educational institution, or society which has as its primary purpose religious ritual or worship or the teaching or spreading of religious doctrine or belief." The bill would not have applied, for example, to a religious school in the hiring of teachers who taught religious tenets, though it would have applied in the hiring of more general positions, such as janitor. There would not have been a general exemption, however, for employers who are Christian. For example, under the bill, a Christian owner of a dry cleaning business would have been in violation of the law to not hire a qualified job applicant simply because the person was gay. Madison attorney Tamara Packard, who has taught sexual orientation and the law as an adjunct professor at the University of Wisconsin Law School, pointed out to us that there was no affirmative action element or quota in the legislation. (She also noted that, despite that federal ENDA legislation has never become law, discrimination in employment against people based on sexual orientation is illegal under Wisconsin law. The state law also includes a religious employer exemption.) So, it’s a stretch to say the ENDA bill Ryan voted for would "force" Christian employers -- or any employers, for that matter -- to hire lesbian, gay or bisexual people. Walter Olson, a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, told us that some employers who would not have otherwise hired a gay person would have been forced to do so, if the person was qualified, or risk violating the law. But what the bill explicitly would have done is prohibit most employers from discriminating against gay, lesbian and bisexual people based on their sexual orientation -- which isn’t the same as requiring they be hired. Our rating The Constitutional Rights PAC said Ryan "is one of only six House Republicans who voted for Teddy Kennedy's bill to force Christian employers to hire LGBT employees." Ryan was among 35 House Republicans, including 10 still in the House (not six), who voted for a so-called ENDA bill that would have prohibited employment discrimination based on sexual orientation. The ENDA bill Ryan voted for, in 2007, was not Kennedy’s bill from 1996. The 2007 bill would have protected lesbian, gay and bisexual people, but not transgender people. The bill, which exempted religious organizations in the hiring of certain employees, would not have forced employers to hire lesbian, gay and bisexual people but rather would have prohibited discriminating against them based on sexual orientation. We rate the statement False. More on Paul Ryan Blogger Erick Erickson: "Paul Ryan is one of less than a dozen Republican congressmen to have voted for every bailout to come before Congress." Mostly False. Ryan: "Every president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt has had" fast-track trade authority. Half True. Ryan: All 28 members of NATO have "pledged to spend at least 2 percent of their economy on defense. But only three countries do -- Britain, Greece and us." Mostly True.

"Horrible news are coming from the President’s house while President (Donald) Trump on Friday began a 17-day stint at his prized golf club in Bedminster, NJ. Barron Trump has been rushed to hospital with severe pneumonia while on holiday in Bedminster, NJ," the Aug. 6 post said. Trump’s youngest son is indeed on vacation with his family at their Bedminster resort, but we found no proof of his purported illness. The post claimed Trump had sent a Snapchat photo to his friends captioned, "Not the sort of bangles I usually choose on holiday." We traced the image attached to the article to an 841-day old photo on an Instagram search engine called Mulpix. It’s not Barron Trump’s hand. "He also tweeted his friends, saying that he was currently ‘in a wheelchair, connected up to tubes, in a hospital,’ " the post said. But we didn’t find any tweets mentioning a wheelchair or a hospital in the various unofficial Barron Trump Twitter pages. The post also cited a nonexistent Fox News report that he was receiving treatment at an unnamed hospital. In reality, the post is stealing some real-life events from surrounding a British television show host. The host of the show Grand Tour, Jeremy Clarkson, was admitted to a Spanish hospital for pneumonia on Aug. 6, the same day as this fake news story was posted. A spokesperson for the show said in a statement that Clarkson "was admitted to hospital on Friday morning during a family holiday in Spain." Clarkson posted a photo on Instagram of his arm which he captioned, "Not the sort of bangles I usually choose on holiday." He also said he was in "in a wheelchair, connected up to tubes, in a hospital" in a tweet.

pomt-13169	"One-half of undocumented workers pay federal income taxes, which means they are paying more federal income taxes than Donald Trump pays."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/27/hillary-clinton/clinton-undocumented-workers-pay-more-trump-federa/	Some undocumented immigrants pay more in federal income taxes than Donald Trump, said Hillary Clinton Oct. 26 at a rally in Tampa, Fla. Less than two weeks before Election Day, the Democratic presidential nominee chastised her opponent for his hardline stance on immigration. "By the way, one-half of undocumented workers pay federal income taxes, which means they are paying more federal income taxes than Donald Trump pays," she said. Experts told us Clinton’s claim is grounded in educated estimates about undocumented immigrants and knowledge of Trump’s past tax practices. But they’re still just estimates. Undocumented workers There is no official count of undocumented workers who pay federal income taxes. But Clinton’s claim — that half of all undocumented workers pay federal income taxes — is an educated assumption that many experts use, said Kim Rueben, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. "As far as we can vet it, it is true," Rueben said. For reference, the Tax Policy Center estimates that 56 percent of the entire population pays federal income tax, while 44 percent don’t. Social Security is one way we know undocumented workers pay federal income taxes. The Social Security Administration estimated that in 2009, 3.1 million unauthorized workers paid into Social Security via payroll tax, even though most will not be able to collect those benefits. In addition to Social Security, payroll taxes also withhold federal income taxes from a worker’s paycheck. There’s also the Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, or ITIN, which people who are unable to obtain Social Security numbers use to pay income taxes, regardless of immigration status. In 2013, 4.3 million people filed tax returns using ITINs. ITIN filers paid $9 billion in payroll taxes in 2014. Most people with an ITIN are undocumented immigrants, said Ruth Wasem, a public policy professor at the University of Texas. The number of people signing up for ITINs and paying taxes that way has grown over the past few years, particularly because many immigration reform proposals require undocumented immigrants to prove they have been paying taxes in order to qualify for some sort of legal status, Wasem said. Between those who contribute via ITIN, others who have taxes withheld from their paycheck, and any overlap between the two groups, Wasem said Clinton’s claim that half of all undocumented workers pay federal income taxes is likely a low ball estimate. Donald Trump While experts can make educated guesses about how many undocumented workers pay federal income taxes, there’s still too much we don’t know about Trump’s tax returns to speculate how much he presently pays in federal income taxes. Going against decades of tradition for presidential nominees, Trump has so far refused to release his tax returns. We know there have been at least a few years Trump didn’t pay federal income taxes and that tax write-offs are generally beneficial to real estate developers like Trump. Three pages of Trump’s 1995 tax returns, uncovered and verified by the New York Times, show it’s possible he was able to legally avoid paying federal income tax for as much as 18 years. A tax provision known as net operating loss allows people to report business losses on their personal tax returns as a deduction. So if a person’s reported net operating loss is equal to or larger than their personal income, that person does not have to pay income taxes. Trump’s $916 million loss reported in his 1995 tax return could counteract any income he earned that year and beyond, up to 18 years total under IRS rules in 1995, according to the New York Times. Going back a few more years, a 1981 report by New Jersey gambling regulators analyzed five years of Trump's finances as part of his efforts to get a casino license for a proposed casino-hotel complex. The report says Trump paid federal taxes for three of those five years, 1975-77, but he did not pay federal income tax in 1978 and 1979. So in the years Trump paid zero federal income taxes, undocumented immigrants who paid any federal income taxes presumably would have paid more than him. But Clinton’s claim is phrased in the present. Without Trump’s current tax returns, we simply don’t know what his tax burden is today. So in the most recent tax year, we don’t know who paid more in federal income tax, Trump or an undocumented worker. Our ruling Clinton said, "One-half of undocumented workers pay federal income taxes, which means they are paying more federal income taxes than Donald Trump pays." While there is no official figure, experts estimate that about half of all undocumented workers pay federal income taxes, if not more. So in a year when Trump does not pay federal income taxes, which has been the case in the past, undocumented immigrants who do federal pay income taxes would pay more than him. But Clinton makes it seem as if this is a present state, and we don’t know anything about Trump’s current tax situation because he has not made his tax returns public. For that reason, we have no way of comparing Trump’s federal income tax payments to those of any given undocumented immigrant. We rate Clinton’s claim Half True.

pomt-15164	Buying the naming rights to the new Falcons stadium is the largest marketing deal in Mercedes-Benz history.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2015/aug/27/steve-cannon/mercedes-benz-target-superlative-about-atlanta-sta/	German luxury automaker Mercedes-Benz this week signed a multimillion-dollar deal that officials said is aimed at further cementing the company’s relationship with Atlanta, home of its new U.S. headquarters. Mercedes-Benz bought the rights to have its name on the still-under construction $1.4 billion stadium that’s to be home to the National Football League’s Atlanta Falcons and Major League Soccer’s Atlanta United. Steve Cannon, CEO of Mercedes-Benz USA, told reporters Monday that buying the naming rights to the new Falcons stadium is the largest marketing deal in the company’s history. PolitiFact was intrigued. We decided to dig deeper. It’s not uncommon for teams not to disclose the financial numbers, and, at Monday’s press conference, officials were mum about the cost to Mercedes-Benz for the near-record 27 year naming rights. (The Atlanta Falcons keep all revenue from the naming rights under a stadium agreement they struck with the city of Atlanta and Georgia World Congress Center.) The Falcons said the goal was to land a deal in the upper range of NFL naming-rights agreements. The largest such deals are a reported $17 million-plus per year for both the New York Giants/Jets' MetLife Stadium and the Dallas Cowboys' AT&T Stadium and $11 million a year for the San Francisco 49ers' Levi's Stadium. We contacted Donna Boland, manager of corporate communications for Mercedes-Benz USA LLC. We asked for evidence supporting Cannon’s statement. "Since he’s been with the company for 24 years, more or less, you can take him at his word that this is the biggest marketing initiative we’ve undertaken," she said. Boland went on to say: "Unfortunately, as a matter of policy, we don’t disclose marketing/sponsorship costs – for this or for the Saints…." PolitiFact reached out to three academics who focus on sports economy. Their estimates of the annual value of the naming rights ranged from a low of $8 million to a high of $20 million. Don Muret, who covers sports venues for Sports Business Journal, citing a source who brokers such deals, put the price of the naming rights in Atlanta at $12 million a year, essentially double what has been widely reported as the amount Mercedes-Benz paid in 2011 for the naming rights to the Superdome for 10 years. Andrew Zimbalist, professor of economics at Smith College, valued the naming rights deal "in the neighborhood of $8 million to $10 million a year," or minimally $216 million for 27 years, given that "Atlanta is a lesser advertising market and the Falcons are not a team with much cachet." Joel Maxcy, associate professor in the Department of Sports Management at Drexel University in Philadelphia, had the highest projection: $20 million a year, on par with the Dallas and Giants/Jets deals, "given the nature of the stadium and where it is in Atlanta." Maxcy said it is likely a very good deal for Mercedes-Benz, given the national and regional television exposure from the professional and college football games, and even the visibility that the stadium has to commuters and travelers to Atlanta, he said. "When you take the gross value -- say $20 million over 27 years for naming rights, that’s why it expands into the biggest deal ever," Maxcy said. " But in 10 years or 12 years, when everybody’s paying double that [for naming rights] that looks really good." Victor Matheson, professor of economics at College of Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass., said he expects the naming rights went for about $11 million, which is what Levi’s paid for the stadium in San Francisco and is about right "given the size of Atlanta." The naming rights deal in Atlanta is one of, but not the longest around, Matheson said. American Airlines has rights to the basketball/hockey area in Dallas for 30 years, he said. Mercedes-Benz has had commercials in past SuperBowls, not a spare-change ticket item. Reports say its naming rights in New Orleans is costing $60 million. On the low end of the estimates we received, the Atlanta naming rights -- 27 years at $8 million -- would total $216 million. (On the high end, 27 years at $20 million, the number jumps to $540 million.) The company also has its names on arenas in Shanghai China and Stuttgart Germany. Sports Business Journal has reported that Mercedes-Benz signed the Shanghi deal in 2009 for 10 years at $6 million a year, $60 million total. We tried to find out about Mercedes-Benz marketing investments, but the closest we could come was figures on what it spends on advertising. The auto maker spends about $340 million a year in the U.S. on advertising across all media, according to the monitoring service Kantar Media. Bradley Johnson, director of data analytics for the trade publication Advertising Age, said the Mercedes-Benz stadium deal in Atlanta will likely account for just a small part of the automaker’s annual marketing budget. Parent company Daimler in 2014 had estimated U.S. ad spending of $561.9 million, primarily for its Mercedes-Benz business, Johnson said, noting that Daimler also markets trucks and buses under brands including Freightliner, Thomas Built Buses, Western Star and Fuso. "If Mercedes says this is its largest marketing deal ever, then it presumably is Mercedes’ largest marketing deal ever," he said. "But most of Mercedes’ ongoing marketing spending doesn’t relate to a single deal. Over the period of this stadium deal, Mercedes is destined to spend billions of dollars on U.S. marketing." Our ruling Steve Cannon, CEO of Mercedes-Benz, said at a press conference on Monday, that buying the naming rights to the new Falcons stadium is the largest marketing deal in Mercedes-Benz history. The cost of those naming rights wasn’t disclosed. The company didn’t provide any evidence to back up his statement when we asked. Experts we talk to said the naming rights probably are costing the luxury car dealer between $8 million and $20 million a year, which over 27 years would be on the low end $216 million. Industry analysts say Mercedes-Benz may spend close to that top dollar figure in a single year, but not on a single marketing deal. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-06129	"I was one of about a dozen (senators) who voted against the Bridge to Nowhere."	true	/virginia/statements/2011/dec/27/george-allen/george-allen-claims-he-was-one-dozen-senators-vote/	Republican Senate candidate George Allen says he gave a thumbs down to a project that became a symbol of federal waste. "I was one of about a dozen (senators) who voted against the Bridge to Nowhere," Allen said in a Dec. 7 debate with Tim Kaine, his expected Democratic rival for the senate seat. Allen, who served in the senate from 2001-2007, was referring to a federal plan to build a $225 million bridge connecting the city of Ketchikan, Alaska, with the Island of Gravina, which has 50 residents. The plan became a lightning rod for critics who said congressional earmarking -- the set aside of federal money for pet projects -- had run amok. Funding for the bridge was included in a $286.5 billion highway and transportation bill in 2005. The Senate passed the legislation on July 29, 2005, by a vote of 91-4. Jamie Radtke, who is challenging Allen for the GOP nomination for the Senate seat, has charged that Allen supported the bridge because he voted for the omnibus highway bill. We’re dismissive of the charge, because funding for the Alaska bridge came to less than one-tenth of one percent of the expenses in the bill. PolitiFact examined a similar charge that President Barack Obama supported the Bridge to Nowhere because, like Allen, he voted in favor of the overall highway bill that contained the bridge funding. The claim -- made by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, was rated Mostly False. But how does Allen justify his assertion that he actually voted against the bridge? Dan Allen, a senior advisor to the Allen campaign, cited the former senator’s vote on an amendment in a later transportation appropriations bill that called for stripping federal funding from the Bridge to Nowhere project. That amendment, sponsored by Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, sought to redirect part of the funding for the Ketchikan-Gravina Island bridge funding to a project to rebuild the Twin Spans Bridge between New Orleans and Slidell, La., which had been damaged during Hurricane Katrina. That amendment failed by a vote of 82-15. Allen was indeed one of the 15 senators who voted in favor of killing the funding for the Bridge to Nowhere. Steve Ellis, the vice president of the Taxpayers for Common Sense, said considering Allen’s vote on the amendment, Allen’s statement is accurate. "It rings pretty true," Ellis said. After the amendment’s defeat, lawmakers hashing out differences between the House and Senate measure of the appropriations bill removed the earmark for the Bridge project and instead provided the money directly to the Alaska Department of Transportation to spend on whatever projects it saw fit. That funding still could have gone to Ketchikan-Gravina Island span, but ultimately the bridge was never built. Our Ruling Allen said he was one of a dozen senators who voted against the Bridge to Nowhere. When faced with a specific amendment to defund the bridge, Allen was one of a minority of senators who opted to kill the project. We rate his claim True.

pomt-05454	"We don’t allow filming inside of the City Hall unless there is a specific reason."	false	/georgia/statements/2012/apr/25/h-ford-gravitt/mayor-orders-camera-council-meeting/	Meetings of the Cumming City Council rarely make the evening news, but that changed last week with video of a woman being tossed out of the public gathering. The woman, Nydia Tisdale, was attempting to film the council’s meeting April 17, but she was told that was not going to happen. "We don’t allow filming inside of the City Hall here," Mayor H. Ford Gravitt said, "unless there is a specific reason." PolitiFact Georgia thought the mayor’s statement was odd, considering our reporters have covered countless City Council meetings throughout the Atlanta region. The city of Cumming is a political subdivision that must abide by the laws of the state of Georgia, which has clear guidelines that generally allow meetings of elected officials to be recorded on video. When the mayor uses the collective "we" in his statement, he is speaking as the elected head of the city. We wondered whether the mayor had a basis for his objection and decided to put it up for a vote on our Truth-O-Meter. In a strange bit of timing, Tisdale was tossed from the council meeting on the same day Gov. Nathan Deal signed House Bill 397, a revised state law on open meetings and records aimed at providing greater access to documents and public meetings. Tisdale, apparently, likes to use the laws to keep others informed about what’s going on in Forsyth County. She has a YouTube channel that includes a recording of a contentious Forsyth County Planning Commission meeting and video of candidate forums. Tisdale was asked to turn off her camera at one Planning Commission meeting because one of the members was distracted by Tisdale holding the camera while speaking to the board. She declined to do so, and she began to recite the state’s open meetings laws. "That’s fine," the official said. Tisdale was recording the April 17 council meeting for nearly two minutes before it started. Once Gravitt called the meeting to order, he turned his attention to Tisdale. The mayor asked the police chief to have the camera removed. "Respectfully, mayor, Georgia’s sunshine laws ..." Tisdale says on the recording. "It’s not for discussion," Gravitt says, waving his hands. "I’m expressing my right as a citizen to record this meeting," Tisdale says as the camera shakes and her voice rises. "Sir, this is an open, public meeting." Gravitt tells Tisdale she’s allowed to take notes. Tisdale responds by saying the city is violating the state’s open meetings law. She eventually turns off her video camera after being removed from the meeting. So was this a violation of the Georgia Open Meetings Act? As promised, Tisdale filed a complaint with the state. The Georgia Attorney General’s Office sent Cumming City Attorney Dana Miles a letter dated April 19 that said "Georgia law expressly allows video recording of public meetings." Title 50, Section 14 of the Georgia Open Meetings Act states that "[v]isual, sound, and visual and sound recording during open meetings shall be permitted" at city council and other meetings. The act does not apply when governing bodies are discussing the acquisition of real estate, records that are not allowed for public inspection and most personnel matters. The mayor told Fox 5 Atlanta that he ordered the video camera turned off because of safety concerns. "I think if it's a safety issue, and you have people running over you maybe in a case of emergency, I think you can use some common sense," Gravitt said. He added: "Visual and sound equipment, it may be permitted. Well, you know, it's a little gray area there. I see it." Gravitt declined our request to talk about this, saying his attorneys have advised him not to do any more interviews. Hollie Manheimer, executive director of the Georgia First Amendment Foundation, said the state’s open meetings laws specify that government meetings are allowed to be recorded. "The point of the Open Meetings Act is to allow an educated public to make informed decisions by way of watching its elected officials at public meetings," she said. "This legislative session, in particular, we all spent so much time on redrafting the statute -- all with the intent of maximizing public access." Manheimer said the past and revised code had similar language that allows city council and other meetings to be recorded. The state’s open meeting laws specifically state that city council meetings can be video recorded, excluding some specific instances. The beginning of this Cumming City Council meeting did not seem to be one of those special cases. We rate the mayor’s claim as False.	None	H.

pomt-14456	Says he "tore down hundreds of abandoned homes that served as havens for crime and reduce(d) the value of our neighborhoods."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2016/mar/04/tim-mcginty/prosecutor-tim-mcginty-claims-credit-demolishing-a/	Ohio has the gloomy distinction of being one of the hardest-hit states in the national foreclosure crisis. Its policymakers are also on the leading edge of crafting legislation to expedite foreclosures, hoping to remedy the hazards of "zombie properties," or vacant homes that sit as bait for vandalism and violent crime. Ohio HB 134 reduces the foreclosure process, which can take two to three years, down to as little as six months. Currently awaiting passage in the Ohio Senate, it would make Ohio the eighth state since 2009 to pass similar legislation. Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine is most clearly associated with leading the demolition of empty homes. Ohio received funding through the National Mortgage Settlement after five of the largest mortgage servicers were accused of questionable lending practices. In 2012, with Ohio’s portion of settlement funds, DeWine dedicated a $75 million grant program to reimburse counties for demolishing abandoned properties. But Cuyahoga County prosecutor Tim McGinty, running for re-election, claims that his office is responsible for hundreds of demolitions in Cleveland. On his campaign website, McGinty claims he "tore down hundreds of abandoned homes that served as havens for crime and reduce the value of our neighborhoods." We zoomed in on the "hundreds" claim. Is McGinty stealing the attorney general’s shine? We made some calls to find out. The city of Cleveland demolished 761 abandoned and blighted properties in 2014 and 2015, according to statistics recently presented in the City Council’s budget hearings. Most of the funds for the tear-downs came from from county and federal dollars, but when demolition dollars dried up, McGinty’s office pitched in $2 million from the county’s Delinquent Tax and Assessment Collection Fund. Gus Frangos, the president of the Cuyahoga County Land Reutilization Corporation (aka the "land bank") says that the prosecutor, the city and his agency teamed up to tackle the problem. The land bank used $125,000 of the prosecutor’s funds to tear down 15 properties in "very challenged neighborhoods, which Prosecutor McGinty’s office has identified based on crime data and other distress factors," Frangos says. His agency tore down an additional 117 structures using its own funds from operating grants, donations and contributions. Dan Williams, city spokesperson, confirms that the city received $1.68 million from the prosecutor’s office and tore down 191 structures in 2015. Our rating McGinty says he tore down "hundreds of abandoned homes." It’s true that he piggybacked on the attorney general’s already-established program. But he also directed spending of $2 million from the Delinquent Tax and Assessment Collection Fund so that more demolitions could take place. The head of the land bank and a city spokesperson confirmed this with their numbers. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Tim McGinty	None	None	None	2016-03-04T13:34:53	2016-03-04	['None']
pomt-08609	"The total number of dollars that passes through the Department of Development is like $900 million and like $650 (million) of it has nothing to do with development, which is breathtaking when you think about it."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2010/sep/22/john-kasich/john-kasich-claims-ohios-department-development-on/	If elected governor in November, Republican challenger John Kasich is certain to rule the state like a CEO managing a Fortune 500 company. In fact, Kasich has said he wanted to completely eliminate the Ohio Department of Development, the state’s primary job development agency. Instead, Kasich would outsource Ohio’s job recruiting and developing efforts to a 12-member private board of hand-picked business leaders who would report to him. In selling this idea to reporters in August, Kasich, who is challenging Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland, ripped the current job creation efforts by the Department of Development as feeble and inefficient. "The total number of dollars that passes through the Department of Development is like $900 million and like $650 (million) of it has nothing to do with development, which is breathtaking when you think about it," Kasich told reporters Aug. 17 in Columbus. Essentially, Kasich is charging that the state’s primary job creation division only uses 28 cents of every taxpayer dollar it spends on seeking out and bringing jobs to Ohio. PolitiFact Ohio wanted to know, did Kasich make an accurate statement or just blurt out a comment to perfectly accompany his new idea? For starters, it is true that there is a lot more going on at the Department of Development besides job creation. The state agency also oversees home winterization and energy reduction projects, Ohio’s tourism marketing, and community development and housing programs, to name a few. The agency’s fiscal year 2011 budget is a little over $930 million. Of that, the agency is spending $327 million this year (not including federal matching funds) directly on what it calls economic development, which is job development programs. That would mean the department spends about 35 percent of its funds for job creation. Thus far, Kasich’s figures are off but his larger point — that a state agency charged with bringing jobs to Ohio spends the bulk of its money elsewhere — has some merit. But those easy to capture figures do not reveal the entire picture, says development Director Lisa Patt-McDaniel. Part of the problem is that through the years as various programs were added, such as providing heating assistance to people who can’t afford to pay their utility bills, state leaders often had no idea where to officially house the programs. Eventually, the Department of Development emerged as a catchall of various projects. Adding more slices to the pie actually crowds the slice entitled "job creation" and makes it appear the agency isn’t putting its all behind its main purpose. Money the department spends in other areas, such as, the Home Winterization Assistance Program, the Community Development Block Grant, even tourism, also each might contain job training programs that indirectly lead to economic development, Patt-McDaniel said. Also, those programs under development that focus on cleaning up brownfields, tidying up neighborhoods and green energy projects all make Ohio a more attractive place to live and do business, which also indirectly lures jobs. Development is really more comprehensive than just straight job development figures, she said. "It's important to understand that companies want to be in good communities with good quality of life and an educated workforce. They are all intertwined and important to each other. Our business is to make a business-friendly climate." For example, the department has budgeted $210 million for winterizing and making other energy saving adjustments to Ohio homes this coming winter. The department says the program alone has helped create 1,300 jobs. But the department cannot say how much of that $210 million can be extrapolated as purely job creation spending. To Kasich’s point, it is hard to believe that a state agency charged with bringing and retaining jobs for Ohio could spend only a small fraction of its state funds on its primary duty. Give him credit for the over-arching point. But his figures are off and do not encapsulate the full picture. Take some credit away for that. We rate his statement as Half True.

pomt-06281	"House Republicans are ramming through legislation ... to classify pizza as a 'vegetable' for the purpose of school lunches."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/22/democratic-national-committee/republicans-pizza-vegetable-school-lunch/	You may have heard the uproar by now: "Pizza is not a vegetable!" Democrats used the rallying cry in a mass e-mail Nov. 17, 2011, alerting partisans that, "House Republicans are ramming through legislation this week to classify pizza as a 'vegetable' for the purpose of school lunches." We wondered: Pizza as a vegetable? We had heard rumblings on social networks about magical pizza seeds and pizza gardens — all in response to Congress' action — and we had to know. Was it true? Here's more from Democrats' message: Why? Because a massive lobbying effort of Republican lawmakers by the frozen pizza industry, among other corporate interests, is underway to get around Obama Administration guidelines to make school lunches contain healthier options. In this Republican Congress, almost anything is up for sale to the highest bidder and most powerful lobbyists -- including the literal definition of the word "vegetable" -- and this time, it's coming at the expense of our kids' health ... Look, we could have a lot of fun with this one. But the fact is that there is a very real bottom line: Childhood obesity has tripled in the past three decades. And for some kids, school lunches are some of the best nutrition options they have during the day. School lunches are hard to change -- and it doesn't take a doozy like "pizza is a vegetable" to know that the corporate interests have more money and more Washington lobbyists than kids do. That's why pizza was classified as a vegetable during the Bush years. The Obama administration made that common-sense change, but the Republican Congress wants to take us back to the money-for-influence status quo. If you think this is as ridiculous as we do, tell the GOP that it's time they started picking real people over corporations (and real vegetables over slices of pizza, for that matter). Then it linked to a message for folks to send from MyDemocrats.org/Pizza. (The message: "Dear House Republicans, Pizza is not a vegetable. Sincerely, America.") We could have a lot of fun with this. We asked the source of the e-mail, Brad Woodhouse at the Democratic National Committee, to back up his statement. He sent us a CBS News/Associated Press article from Nov. 15, 2011, "Congress pushes back on healthier school lunches." The topic? A spending bill that forces the U.S. Department of Agriculture to ignore a proposed change from the Obama administration about how to credit tomato paste. (Congress simply won't fund implementation of the new rule.) The House and Senate both approved the bill Nov. 17, and the president signed it the next day. The new law doesn't mention pizza. What it does is allow just two tablespoons of tomato paste to continue to count as a serving of vegetables. The USDA had proposed requiring a full half-cup of the concentrated tomato spread before it would count as a fruit or veggie — a standard "serving" by volume — far more than you'd find slathered on a slice o' school cafeteria pizza. (And, yes, we're aware the tomato is technically a fruit. The federal regulations cover both fruits and vegetables, but most folks in this debate are referring to tomatoes as vegetables. Just roll with it.) How crazy is considering tomato paste on a pizza as a vegetable? One Washington Post Wonkblog reporter said that it's not as nuts as you might think. Sarah Kliff pointed out that two tablespoons of tomato paste offer up a nutritional profile comparable to a half-cup of apples or other fresh fruit. It offers more than a gram each of fiber and protein and more calcium and potassium than the apples. It also packs beta carotene and the antioxidant lycopene, according the the USDA. We should also note that the slices kids get at school aren't exactly the greasy, meat-laden marvels they might pick up at a pizza parlor. Federal nutrition standards require that school meals get no more than 30 percent of their calories from fat, and less than 10 percent from saturated fat. Schwan Food Co., which makes 70 percent of school-lunch pizza, started adding protein and whole grains to crusts and pushing down fat and salt to meet school standards. Not to mention, if that slice doesn't have at least two tablespoons of tomato paste on it, it's not going to fly. No creamy white or pesto pizza gets automatic credit. (Well, unless that pesto's made from enough basil or spinach ... but we digress.) Still, Margo Wootan, nutrition policy director for Center for Science in the Public Interest said in a Nov. 15 press release that, "if finalized, this legislation may go down in nutritional history as a bigger blunder than when the Reagan Administration tried (but failed) to credit ketchup as a vegetable in the school lunch program. Pizza should be served with a vegetable, not count as one." She's right that if the tomato paste didn't count as a serving of vegetables, kids would benefit from tomato-paste-covered pizza plus an additional serving of a vegetable. But is this the great Reagan ketchup debacle? The same amount of ketchup, according to the USDA, sneaks in about 10 times the sodium, contains just a third of the protein, less than a tenth of the fiber and more carbs and sugar. It offers smaller traces of vitamins, and half the beta carotene and lycopene. Tomato paste is not ketchup. Still, frozen pizza manufacturers and the frozen food industry did push hard to keep the vegetable designation for the tomato paste on the pizza. When it does, that's one less vegetable the school has to buy and a cheaper deal for school districts. Fewer vegetables for kids may not be exactly a win for America. But did House Republicans try "to classify pizza as a 'vegetable' for the purpose of school lunches"? They did fight for the classification for the sauce on the pizza and blocked a move by the Obama administration to boost the amount of tomato paste needed to count as a serving of vegetables. But they didn't try to classify "pizza" as a vegetable. And even the amount of tomato paste required, just two tablespoons, packs nearly the nutritional punch of a half-cup of other foods we consider healthy. That's a pretty important detail to omit. We call the Democrats' claim Half True.	None	Democratic National Committee	None	None	None	2011-11-22T10:41:44	2011-11-17	['Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-12838	The seven nations identified in Donald Trump's travel ban were "identified by the Obama administration as the seven most dangerous countries in the world in regard to harboring terrorists."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/feb/07/reince-priebus/were-7-nations-identified-donald-trumps-travel-ban/	Two days after President Donald Trump temporarily banned certain groups of people from entering the United States, his chief of staff, Reince Priebus, defended the executive order by directing attention to terrorism and Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama. The protest-triggering order has been criticized as a "Muslim ban" (it is and it isn’t, we found). But Trump refutes that, asserting that the part of the order targeting seven Muslim-majority countries is aimed at fighting terrorism. Priebus, a Wisconsin native, appeared Jan. 29, 2017 on NBC’s "Meet the Press" and said: Here’s the deal: If you're coming in and out of one of those seven countries -- by the way, identified by the Obama administration as the seven most dangerous countries in the world in regard to harboring terrorists and affirmed by Congress multiple times -- then you're going to be subjected temporarily with more questioning until a better program is put in place over the next several months. As we noted in our Muslim ban article, the large majority of jihadists committing acts of terror in America have been American citizens or legal residents. And since 9/11, no one in the United States has been killed in a terrorist attack by someone from the seven countries, though there have been at least three non-deadly cases in which the perpetrator was connected to Iran or Somalia. So, were the seven nations that are identified in Trump's travel ban pegged by the Obama administration as the "seven most dangerous countries in the world in regard to harboring terrorists"? Not quite in that way, but Priebus has a point. Trump’s order Trump’s executive order has two major components. It suspended entry of all refugees -- those who want to resettle in the United States -- for 120 days and barred refugees from Syria indefinitely. It also prohibits nearly all citizens from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen from entering the United States for 90 days. That travel part of the order is a Muslim ban in the sense that most residents of those seven countries are Muslim. But it’s not a ban, in the sense that the vast majority of Muslims in the world don’t live in those countries and thus are not affected by the order. A week after the order, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order, lifting the ban, although more court action followed. The Obama connection The travel part of Trump’s order does target the same seven countries that were singled out with a law Obama signed in December 2015. The Obama-signed law contains provisions that restrict travel to the United States for people who lived in or visited Iran, Iraq, Sudan, or Syria since March 2011. They must have a visa to enter the United States; they can’t use what is known as the Visa Waiver Program, which allows 90-day U.S. visits to other foreign visitors. The law was soon expanded by Obama’s Department of Homeland Security to cover Libya, Somalia, and Yemen. They were identified in the agency’s announcement as "countries of concern," a phrase used in the law. Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told us Priebus’ claim is not misleading, but that the law Obama signed doesn’t define the seven countries as the most dangerous in terms of harboring terrorists. There are other countries where terrorists are active but could have been left off the Obama list for other reasons, he said. There are countries, such as Pakistan, Afghanistan and others, where militants have significant space to operate, but there could be a variety of reasons why they were not included with countries where travel without visas is restricted by Obama law, he said. For instance, the U.S. government has a delicate relationship with the Pakistani government and there might be a desire on the part of the United States not to restrict travel from people in certain countries. Two notes before we close that don’t directly bear on Priebus’ claim, but shed light on the seven countries: Iran (added in 1984), Sudan (1993) and Syria (1979) are the only countries on the U.S. State Department’s list of "state sponsors of terrorism." They were determined by the secretary of state to have "repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism." Iraq, Libya, Somalia and Yemen are on the State Department’s list of "terrorist safe havens" -- where terrorists operate "in relative security." But nine other countries or regions are on the safe havens list, too. Our rating Priebus said Trump's executive order that temporarily bans nearly all travel to the United States from seven nations were "identified by the Obama administration as the seven most dangerous countries in the world in regard to harboring terrorists." Prompted by concerns about terrorism, the Obama administration did put those seven countries -- Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen -- on a list that makes travel into the United States somewhat more difficult. But that list doesn’t necessarily identify the seven as being the most dangerous. For a statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context, our rating is Half True.

pomt-05324	After they bought GST Steel, "Mitt Romney and his partners loaded it with debt, closed the Kansas City plant and walked away with a healthy profit, leaving hundreds of employees out of work with their pensions in jeopardy."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/16/barack-obama/obama-ad-claims-romney-bain-left-misery-wake-gst-s/	Mitt Romney’s business record is the central narrative of his presidential campaign -- and the main line of attack by his rivals. Is he a savvy businessman who understands the factors that make economies thrive? Or a corporate raider who makes rich profits for himself while often leaving working people as collateral damage? You can guess which storyline President Barack Obama’s campaign is weaving. A new ad from Team Obama tells the story of GST Steel, a company taken over by Bain Capital, the private equity firm Romney led for years before his entrance into politics. In the ad, we meet several steelworkers who lost their jobs eight years after Bain took over GST. The plant, which went through several owners, first opened in 1888. At its peak it employed 4,500 people in jobs that ensured college for the kids and a secure retirement.. But by the mid 1990s, the plant was struggling against competition and operating with outdated equipment. Bain bought the mill in 1993, took on debt, changed the management and paid dividends to investors. It created a new parent company, GS Industries, and acquired other steel businesses, building its reach, and its debt. Then steel prices dove, and the company had no cushion to weather the difficult times. In 2001, the parent company filed for bankruptcy protection — and shut down the Kansas City plant. "It was like watching an old friend bleed to death," former employee Joe Soptic says in the ad. Then we hear Romney’s voice: "As I look around at the millions of Americans without work, it breaks my heart." We’re checking a statement from an Obama campaign news release announcing the ad. It sums up the GST story this way: "After purchasing the company, Mitt Romney and his partners loaded it with debt, closed the Kansas City plant and walked away with a healthy profit, leaving hundreds of employees out of work with their pensions in jeopardy." First, some background The Kansas City plant produced wire for mattress springs and tires, as well as high-carbon balls and rods used by the mining industry to pulverize rocks. In 1993, owner Armco was looking to sell it, and selected Bain because the firm "had earned a sterling reputation for turning companies around," according to a Reuters story from January 2012 about Bain’s takeover. Bain Capital, in a statement responding to Obama’s ad, says it "undertook an ambitious plan in 1993 to turnaround GSI, a struggling manufacturer of specialty steel products that was slated for closure if no investor could be found. We invested more than $100 million and many thousands of hours into this turnaround, upgrading its facilities in an attempt to make the company competitive." Bain and its partners decided to buy the mill for $75 million, with Bain itself putting up about $8 million to gain majority control of the company, renamed GS Technologies Inc. We’ll examine each claim in the statement. So first, we address whether Bain "loaded" the steel company with debt. ‘Loaded it with debt’ After its initial $8 million investment, the new company issued $125 million in bonds — paying $65 million to stockholders in 1994, according to GS Technologies Operating Co. filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Bain collected a $36.1 million dividend, according to Reuters. GS Technologies announced plans to spend $98 million modernizing the Kansas City plant and in 1995, issued another $125 million in bonds to pay for a merger with another wire rod maker in South Carolina. Bain reinvested $16.5 million of its earlier dividend, Reuters wrote. GST’s total debt in 1995: $378 million. "Paying distributions with debt is not uncommon," Campbell Harvey, a finance professor at Duke University, told Reuters. "The only thing that strikes me as a bit unusual is the size of the dividend. There would be logic in them saving some cash for a downturn." Josh Kosman, a New York Post reporter and author of the book The Buyout of America: How Private Equity is Destroying Jobs and Killing the American Economy, said Bain reinvested its dividends so it could merge with the other steel company. "They needed to get bigger, to have more earnings to be able to handle the debt," Kosman told PolitiFact. Plans were put in place to take the company public, but other problems intervened. According to a 2002 story in the Boston Globe, plant workers said the company’s new owners brought in an inexperienced management team that had no expertise in steel manufacturing, although filings show several top executives did have experience at steel companies. In April 1997, the company faced its first labor strike in 40 years. The walkout stretched over 10 weeks, becoming bitter, divisive and sometimes violent. Then prices for electricity and natural gas skyrocketed. A power bill in September 1998 was more than double what it had been in 1997, a costly increase because the plant depended so heavily on electrical equipment. Meanwhile, a flood of cheap steel imports drove down prices in the late ‘90s, the company reported. In 1998, it worked with other steel companies and United Steelworkers of America to petition the government for limits on wire rod imports. But Kosman, the book author, argues that the debt acquired under Bain was the overriding problem. "After quickly raising profits, (Bain) had the company, less than one year after the buyout, borrow another $61 million to pay themselves a dividend. This left little room for error as profit, $32 million in 1995, could barely cover the increased interest expenses, rising from $9 million to $24 million," Kosman told us in an email. "Even when profits fell below interest payments in 1998 and 1999 due to cheap imports, there was enough operating profit to survive if not for the interest expense." In its 2001 bankruptcy filing, GS Industries listed total debts of $554 million. ‘Closed the Kansas City plant’ Along with the bankruptcy filing came the announcement that GS Industries was shutting down the Kansas City mill. Some 750 employees were put out of work. In a news release, the company said the bankruptcy was triggered in part by "the critical need to restructure the company's liabilities." How much of that was Romney’s fault? Mark Essig, GS Industries’ former CEO, never met Romney. Essig came aboard in January 1998, the year before Romney left to run the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics. "His name never came up in conversation," Essig told PolitiFact. "In my tenure at GSI, he wasn't involved at all." Of course, by the time Essig came on board, the bulk of the debt had already been acquired, during years in which Romney ran Bain. (That’s very different from another Bain investment we examined, KB Toys, in which Bain Capital didn’t get involved until after Romney left.) Romney wasn’t on GS Industries’ board of directors, but several Bain employees were. Still, Essig points to a complex picture. Nearly half of U.S. steel companies filed for bankruptcy around the same time that GS Industries did. Major customers of the Kansas City plant did, too, Essig said. "Prices went down, costs had gone up, and it was kind of the perfect storm," he said. "Our debt load was a factor, no question about it. But there were companies without that debt load that also filed bankruptcy." Meanwhile, Essig pointed out, closing the Kansas City plant allowed GS Industries to save other plants. "In that respect, we viewed it as a partial victory," Essig said. Romney, who had left the company, retained his title as CEO of Bain Capital but was not involved in day-to-day operations. "I take personal responsibility for making the investment," Romney said in a statement at the time of the plant closure, according to the Globe. "But I didn't manage these companies. Our philosophy at Bain Capital was to support management teams in companies where we saw potential for growth, or in companies that were in financial distress that we thought we might be able to save." Essig, who voted for Obama in 2008 but this year plans to vote for Romney, doesn’t blame him. "No matter how you look at it or what side of the fence you're on, a plant closing is a tragedy for people. I think when you try to tie it to a person and say, Mitt was responsible for this — a lot of steel companies went out of business at that time, and Mitt had nothing to do with it," he said. "That was a macro-industry tidal wave that hit that plant. I bet if the Bain folks had to do it over again, they wouldn't have gotten involved with it. It can't be treated lightly, but to lay it at the doorstep of Mitt, I think, is not accurate." ‘Walked away with a healthy profit’ Bain had always turned impressive profits, and the GS Industries deal was no exception. The Los Angeles Times wrote last year that a prospectus from 2000 showed Bain delivered an average annual return of 88 percent from 1984 to 1999. The L.A. Times said Bain invested a total of $24 million in the entire steel company deal (including the merger in South Carolina) and ended up with a $50 million return -- "a 100 percent gain." Reuters also noted that Romney continued receiving dividends from Bain after he left, and Bain collected $900,000 a year from the steel company for management consulting services through 1999. ‘Leaving hundreds of employees out of work with their pensions in jeopardy’ Following the bankruptcy, GS Industries announced it would not provide workers with severance pay, health insurance, life insurance and pension supplements that had been promised. GS Industries also left the company’s pension underfunded by $44 million and in 2002 the U.S. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. bailed it out. Basic pension payments were covered, Reuters wrote, but not the supplement agreed to with the union. Our ruling Obama’s ad, and the news release announcing it, packed a lot of claims about Romney’s tenure at Bain Capital and how it handled its investment in a Kansas City steel mill. We are checking this claim: "After purchasing the company, Mitt Romney and his partners loaded it with debt, closed the Kansas City plant and walked away with a healthy profit, leaving hundreds of employees out of work with their pensions in jeopardy." We found, through corporate filings, interviews and investigations by other news organizations, that the statement is accurate but needs some clarification. First, it’s true that Bain added significantly to GST’s debt load while paying dividends to itself. The plant’s closure, however, happened after Romney had left daily operations at Bain, though he led Bain during six years of its majority investment in the plant. And other, outside factors were at work, making the steel industry a tough business. Steel prices were low and electricity costs were high, and those forces drove other steel mills out of business around the same time. The statement’s last two claims are solid: Bain (and Romney) made a profit from taking over GST, and the employees lost many benefits their union had negotiated, including supplemental pension payments. The federal government had to step in to shore up the fund. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-05-16T18:43:46	2012-05-14	['Kansas_City,_Missouri']
pomt-06556	Says Tommy Thompson "pushed such strict laws that abortion providers faced potential life imprisonment and women were forced to cross state lines in order to receive attention for life-threatening issues."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/oct/03/emilys-list/emilys-list-says-gop-us-senate-hopeful-tommy-thomp/	EMILY’s List, one of the 100 largest overall donors to federal elections over the past two decades, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, has set its sights on the race for an open U.S. Senate seat in Wisconsin. The group -- whose acronym stands for "Early Money Is Like Yeast" -- has raised $8.39 million in the 2011-2012 election cycle alone to elect pro-choice Democratic women to office. Founded in 1985, the group takes credit for helping elect 16 women to the U.S. Senate and 86 women, including Wisconsin’s Tammy Baldwin, to the U.S. House of Representatives. EMILY’s List is backing Baldwin’s run for the Senate seat that is being vacated in 2012 by Wisconsin Democrat Herb Kohl. And it is criticizing the Republican Senate hopefuls, including state Assembly Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald, former U.S. Rep. Mark Neumann and former Gov. Tommy Thompson. In a Sept. 19, 2011 blog post, EMILY’s List derided all three GOP contenders as "far-right, conservative white males." It focused criticism on Thompson, who was Wisconsin’s governor from 1987 to 2001 before becoming U.S. health and human services secretary under President George W. Bush. The group declared that as governor, Thompson "pushed such strict laws that abortion providers faced potential life imprisonment and women were forced to cross state lines in order to receive attention for life-threatening issues." Strong words and a strong statement. The statement contains two parts. We’ll address them one at a time. Abortion providers facing prison In its blog post, EMILY’s List cited a 1998 Wisconsin law signed by Thompson that banned most partial-birth abortions. The law defined the procedure, performed during the second or third trimester of pregnancy, as one "in which a person partially vaginally delivers a living child, causes the death of the partially delivered child with the intent to kill the child and then completes the delivery of the child." Under the law, a partial-birth abortion could be performed to save the life of a woman. But anyone who illegally performed a partial-birth abortion could be convicted of a Class A felony, punishable by life in prison. That procedure, long controversial, is rarely used -- a point even pro-choice advocates made when fighting the ban. At the time, Thompson was quoted as saying: "This issue has captured our hearts, for the people of Wisconsin will not stand for a procedure so heartless to occur in our state. This is a matter of humanity. Banning partial birth abortions is simply the right thing to do.'' A federal appeals court struck down the Wisconsin law as unconstitutional in 2001. That court cited a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on a similar Nebraska law, which the high court said put an "undue burden upon a woman's right to make an abortion decision." That left Wisconsin among 14 states whose partial-birth ban laws have been blocked by courts and are not in effect, according to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, an independent research organization that analyzes data on population growth and reproductive health. The institute doesn’t have statistics on partial-birth abortions, per se, but its latest national figures show that 1.5 percent of abortions in 2006 were done during the late second trimester or the third trimester of pregnancy. In any case, partial-birth abortions make up only a portion of the 1.5 percent of all abortions that are performed later in a pregnancy. So, although partial-birth abortions were rarely done, Thompson did --as EMILY’s List claimed -- support a law that subjected partial-birth abortion providers to possible life imprisonment. Women forced to leave state The second claim made by EMILY’s List was "women were forced to cross state lines in order to receive attention for life-threatening issues." The group cited news articles about abortion providers around Wisconsin canceling abortion appointments after a federal judge refused to issue a temporary restraining order to prevent the 1998 partial-birth ban law from going into effect. The articles quoted providers as saying that women who had scheduled abortions were forced to reschedule them or to get the procedure done out of state. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported at the time that abortion providers throughout Wisconsin put all abortion procedures on hold for a few days as they waited for legal questions about the law to be sorted out. EMILY’s List did not provide us evidence to show that any women left Wisconsin "to receive attention for life-threatening issues." The group’s spokeswoman, Jess McIntosh, said in an email: "The abortion providers who stopped working told dozens of prospective patients who needed to be seen immediately that they had to travel. Assuming not a single one did that and went on to have the procedure just isn't plausible." It’s also not likely, however, that all or even most females who were seeking an abortion at the time faced a life-threatening situation. Asked about the EMILY’s statement, Thompson campaign spokesman Darrin Schmitz said: "Gov. Thompson is proud of his pro-life record and defense of the unborn." Our conclusion In support of Baldwin’s Senate bid, EMILY’s List said Thompson had "pushed such strict laws that abortion providers faced potential life imprisonment and women were forced to cross state lines in order to receive attention for life-threatening issues." A partial-birth abortion ban that Thompson signed into law as Wisconsin’s governor did contain the life imprisonment provision. The law also caused many abortion providers, at least for a few days, to stop performing abortions. That means it was possible some Wisconsin women had to leave the state in order to get an abortion. But there is no proof, as EMILY’s List claimed, that women were forced to leave the state "to receive attention for life-threatening issues." We rate the EMILY’s List statement Half True.

pomt-06784	"Our credit rating went up since I've been in office."	false	/florida/statements/2011/aug/17/rick-scott/countrys-credit-rating-down-floridas/	In light of Standard & Poor's recent downgrade of America's credit rating from AAA to AA+, Republicans in Florida are trying to draw a contrast with President Barack Obama by claiming -- or at least passing along the news -- that Florida's credit rating has been upgraded. Florida Gov. Rick Scott made the declaration Aug. 11, 2011, in an interview with Panama City radio station WFLA 94.5 "Our credit rating went up since I've been in office," he said. "And their credit rating (the federal government's) is dropping because they’re not doing what we're doing in Florida. We are the most fiscal responsible state in the country." We've seen similar claims pop up repeatedly in the past few days. For example: • Adam Hasner, a former state House member and a candidate for U.S. Senate, tweeted, "S&P's upgrade of FL's credit proves balanced budget is first step towards fiscal solvency." • The Republican Party of Florida also posted the good news on Twitter. "Obama & the federal govt could learn a few things from FL & @FLGovScott—FL's credit rating was recently upgraded to AAA." • Same for Scott's official campaign Twitter feed @ScottForFlorida, which sent this message: "RT @FreedomsMob: USA downgraded by S&P, Florida upgraded to AAA by S&P http://t.co/F2qa5XK." The link takes people to an interview between Scott and CNBC host Larry Kudlow. "While the U.S. had its own debt downgraded, the Sunshine State of Florida (got) upgraded by S&P," Kudlow said before introducing Scott. Did Florida's credit rating go up, while the United States' credit rating went down? Standard & Poor's is a New York-based ratings agency that studies the financial markets. It issues guidance to investors and rates various investments for financial risk. That includes investments in public debt, such as bonds issued by the state of Florida. S&P spokesman Olayinka Fadahunsi told us that Florida has held S&P's AAA rating since February 2005. That means the agency considers Florida to have "extremely strong capacity to meet financial commitments." It's also the highest rating the agency gives. So how could Florida's rating have been upgraded? It wasn't, Fadahunsi said. Here's what happened: In January 2009, the agency changed its outlook on Florida debt. An "outlook" is an evaluation of the likely direction of a rating over six months to two years. In 2009, S&P's outlook on Florida's rating dropped from "stable," which means that a rating isn't likely to change, to "negative," which means that a rating may be lowered. In July 2011, as the United States was having its rating issues, things reversed course in Florida. S&P revised its outlook for Florida from negative back to stable (registration required to see report) based on the latest budget passed by the GOP-controlled Legislature and signed by Gov. Rick Scott. "The outlook revision reflects our view of the progress the state has made in addressing its structural imbalance through significant cost-cutting measures adopted in fiscal 2012 and maintenance of strong reserves," said Standard & Poor's credit analyst John Sugden-Castillo. The outlook change did not affect Florida's AAA rating. We also asked S&P spokesman Fadahunsi whether the agency considers a change in outlook a credit "upgrade." "We don't consider outlook changes upgrades or downgrades," he said. State Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater put it best in an Aug. 9, 2011, interview with the St. Petersburg Times. "Florida was AAA before the downgrade, it's AAA today, and in fact the rating agencies just upgraded our longer term outlook," Atwater said. Part of the problem with this myth is that the media has at times perpetuated it. On Aug. 16, for instance, the Wall Street Journal published an opinion piece headlined "Upgrading the States." It began: "Ohio and Florida get plenty of attention as Presidential election swing states, but this year they deserve notice for another reason. While Uncle Sam was having its debt downgraded, Ohio and Florida both got upgrades from Standard & Poor's in July as a result of their improved fiscal management." After more detail about Ohio, it added: "Ditto for Florida, which won a AAA rating after closing a budget hole with what S&P said were 'significant cost-cutting measures' and making a commitment to maintaining strong reserves. Governor Rick Scott's 2012 budget was praised for 'significant measures' to address its budget deficit and for being 'proactive in reducing expenditures to adjust for revenue shortfalls.'" We also found this Aug. 16 report from WOKV radio in Jacksonville. "While the United States credit rating with Standard & Poor's may have been downgraded recently, Florida's jumped from AA+ to AAA." The WOKV report quotes Atwater as seemingly acknowledging the ratings upgrade. "We went through, got lower pricing, because a triple A bond rating can give us that. In this marketplace, there aren't many of us out there who have that rating," Atwater said, according to the report. But CFO spokeswoman Alexis Lambert said the report misinterpreted Atwater. "The CFO was discussing Standard & Poor's revised outlook for Florida from negative to stable and the state’s ability to refinance bonds in the current market conditions," Lambert told us. To recap: Florida's credit rating was upgraded to AAA in 2005 while Jeb Bush was governor. Its rating has been the same ever since. The only thing that changed is S&P's outlook on Florida debt. It went from stable to negative, then back to stable. But that isn't considered an upgrade, the ratings agency says. (We should note that Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the Republican Party of Florida, corrected his tweet about the credit rating. "Correction: S&P made positive change to the outlook of FL's credit worthiness, not the rating.") Standard & Poor's did react favorably to Florida's budget behavior this year. Both the S&P press release and a longer report we reviewed from the July outlook change spoke highly of Florida's fiscal strategy, especially its willingness to cut spending as revenue dropped. But it's not accurate to say Florida's credit rating went up, so we rule Scott's statement False.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2011-08-17T17:44:14	2011-08-11	['None']
pomt-08069	Unemployment and the housing and auto industry crises can be fixed by giving a million dollars to every worker over age 50 to retire.	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2010/dec/22/chain-email/simple-solution-economic-crisis-would-cost-more-th/	Sometimes it's the simple, overlooked solution that's the best. One proposal for fixing the U.S. economy, known as the "Patriotic Retirement Plan," is making the rounds in e-mail inboxes, along with a notation that says, "I think this guy nailed it!" In some variations, it takes the form of a letter to the president: "Instead of giving billions of dollars to companies that will squander the money on lavish parties and unearned bonuses, use the following plan. You can call it the 'Patriotic Retirement Plan': "There are about 40 million people over 50 in the work force. Pay them $1 million apiece severance for early retirement with the following stipulations: "1.) They MUST retire. Forty million job openings -- Unemployment fixed. "2.) They MUST buy a new AMERICAN car. Forty million cars ordered -- Auto Industry fixed. "3.) They MUST either buy a house or pay off their mortgage -- Housing Crisis fixed. "It can't get any easier than that!! "P.S. If more money is needed, have all members in Congress pay their taxes. Mr. President, while you're at it, make Congress retire on Social Security and Medicare. I'll bet both programs would be fixed pronto! "If you think this would work, please forward to everyone you know." Apparently a lot of people are buying it. This e-mail, written and passed along by the mathematically challenged, has been going around since 2009, helped by the note that it was published Feb . 8, 2009, in The St. Petersburg Times. (The newspaper asked readers for their suggestions to fix the economy. This was one of more than two dozen responses.) Even though the plan was debunked by Snopes.com in April 2009, it continues to thrive on the Internet. A quick Google search shows that it has popped up on blogs as recently as last month, with supporting comments such as this one on Nov. 27 on Tech Support Forums: "That's so simple, and yet such a good idea ... I'm in, I'm only 47 give me a million I'll retire tomorrow, pay off my house keep my American cars I already have, split the rest in half and put half in the bank, invest the other half and live the rest of my life in comfort, and with the security the govt PROMISED me when I first joined the Navy." But as soon as you look at the numbers, the plan disintegrates. Giving 40,000,000 people $1,000,000 each would cost the United States $40,000,000,000,000, or $40 trillion. In contrast, the controversial TARP bank bailout package passed by the federal government was worth about $0.7 trillion (or $700 billion). That's just 1.8 percent of what this e-mail proposes to spend. To put this in perspective, the national debt as of Dec. 17 was nearly $14 trillion dollars. That's $44,648 for every man, woman and child -- legal and illegal -- in the United States. Getting 40 million Americans to retire early and spend money on a car and home would certainly help out the housing and automotive industries. But saying that our economic problems would be solved by nearly quadrupling our national debt to $173,000 per person is a ridiculous statement. Personally, we don't have that kind of money to burn. So, instead, we'll take a match and lighter fluid to this e-mail and declare it Pants on Fire!	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2010-12-22T00:01:00	2010-12-20	['None']
pomt-01991	There have been 74 "school shootings in America since Sandy Hook."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/13/everytown-gun-safety/have-there-been-74-school-shootings-sandy-hook-clo/	After an Oregon high school freshman armed with an assault rifle injured a teacher, killed a student and killed himself Tuesday, a striking statistic began circulating on the internet. It said that at least 74 school shootings had occurred since December 2012, when an assault on Sandy Hook Elementary School by Adam Lanza left 28 dead, including Lanza and his mother. The statistic came from Everytown for Gun Safety, an advocacy group founded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and gun-control advocate Shannon Watts. That comes out to more than one school shooting per week. Numerous media outlets reported the 74 school shootings figure, and the number spread widely in Facebook posts and through other forms of social media. Even President Barack Obama brought up the once-a-week line in an interview with Tumblr CEO David Karp. In the interview, Obama discussed his frustration with lawmakers’ inaction on gun control legislation, particularly in the wake of Sandy Hook. While it’s not clear that Obama was specifically referencing the statistic compiled by Everytown, his comment was in line with their math. "We’re the only developed country on Earth where this happens," he said, "and it happens now once a week." But as widely as the number spread, it also attracted criticism. Charles Johnson, who writes for the conservative Daily Caller, garnered attention for what he considered a debunking of the Everytown list. We decided to sift through the numbers ourselves. How Everytown counted 74 incidents To its credit, Everytown provided details on each of the 74 shootings, including the date, city and school location. The group also clearly laid out its methodology at the bottom of the list. These make it possible for the critics -- and us -- to look under the hood at its calculations. The main reason for the criticism of Everytown’s count is that its definition of "school shooting" is relatively broad. The group’s criteria goes beyond what many people would consider "school shootings" -- incidents in which a student or an intruder enters a school and fires at innocent students and staff. For many people, this is the first thing that comes to mind when they hear the phrase "school shooting" -- an incident such as Sandy Hook or, before it, the 1999 Columbine shooting in Colorado that left 15 dead, including the shooters. Here’s the methodology as explained by the group at the bottom of the list: Incidents were classified as school shootings when a firearm was discharged inside a school building or on school or campus grounds, as documented in publicly reported news accounts. This includes assaults, homicides, suicides, and accidental shootings. Incidents in which guns were brought into schools but not fired there, or were fired off school grounds after having been possessed in schools, were not included.... Incidents were identified through media reports, so this is likely an undercount of the true total. This definition allows for incidents that don’t typically call to mind the term "school shooting" -- for example, a case in which a man unaffiliated with Alogna High/Middle School in Iowa killed himself in the school’s parking lot in the middle of the night, or an early-morning armed robbery on a street that goes through the Marquette University campus in Wisconsin. Both count in Everytown’s tally. Clearly it is difficult to draw lines. The Everytown list did not include the recent and highly publicized shooting spree in Isla Vista, Calif. In that case, the shooter was a student at the University of California at Santa Barbara, and he targeted other students, including women living in a sorority house near the campus. Seven people died, but the shooting wasn’t technically on campus, so it didn’t make the list. Our Breakdown We reviewed news reports for all 74 shootings and did our best to sort them into five categories. Here’s our breakdown. (See individual shootings by category here, with clickable links to news reports on each shooting.) • Incidents such as Sandy Hook or Columbine in which the shooter intended to commit mass murder: 10 instances • Incidents related to criminal activity (such as drug dealing or robbery), or personal altercations: 39 instances • Incidents unconnected to members of school community and/or that took place outside school hours: 16 instances • Suicides: 6 instances • Accidental discharges: 3 instances In all, these 74 incidents resulted in 38 deaths and 53 injuries. The biggest death toll in one incident was a shooting spree that ended at Santa Monica College. Six people died, though not all of them took place on the campus. While the list includes a lot of gunfire, deaths and injuries, only about 14 percent were shootings that mirrored Columbine and Sandy Hook. In addition, almost half -- 35 -- occurred at a college or university rather than a K-12 school. This clashes with the imagery invoked by the line in the chart’s introduction, that "we should feel secure in sending our children to school — comforted by the knowledge that they’re safe." We asked James Fox, a criminology professor at Northeastern University, for some perspective. He pointed to the 2013 "Indicators of School Crime and Safety" report compiled by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. There were about 45 school-associated violent deaths (not just by guns) at elementary and secondary schools each year between the 1992 and 2010 school years, according to the report. The highest annual total was 63 deaths in 2006-07, while the lowest was 31 in 2010-11. In other words, Fox said, the number of gun deaths documented by Everytown over the past year and a half are not out of the ordinary. About 15 to 20 kids in grades K-12 are killed at school each year, along with a similar number of college students, he said. Is it misleading? The experts we consulted agreed that Everytown’s broad definition of "school shooting" could be misleading, encouraging them to assume that there have been 74 incidents similar to Columbine or Sandy Hook. While the Everytown definition is certainly one way of calculating it, there is such a range of motivations, degrees of planning and outcomes that it ceases to be an especially useful measurement, said Jay Corzine, a University of Central Florida sociology professor. Mark Safarik, president of Forensic Behavioral Services Inc. and a former member of the FBI Behavioral Analysis Unit, agreed that when the average person thinks of a school shooting, they think of a mass murder like Sandy Hook. "There is an ocean of difference between Sandy Hook, Virginia Tech and Columbine and a depressed student who (commits suicide) at school, or an accidental discharge," Safarik said. "To call them all school shootings may be true in a technical sense but is quite disingenuous on an emotional level, which is where they are trying to capture for their audience." Everytown has countered the media criticism by arguing that focusing too closely on Sandy Hook-like incidents unfairly diminishes the full extent of the dangers to students and staff posed by guns in or near schools. "The country's gun-violence epidemic has seeped into our children's schools, and that is a problem, regardless of the body count," said spokeswoman Erika Lamb. "Those lives count, too, even if the media is only focused on mass tragedies." Corzine prefers the designation used by the New York Police Department, among others -- "active shooter," which limits the list to incidents that occur during school hours, involving a firearm discharged with the intent to kill or injure others on school grounds or while in transit on a school vehicle. In addition, Fox said the statistic is misleading for another reason -- it focuses on short-term patterns, rather than long-term trends. Despite the media focus, Fox said, it’s worth noting that the number of school-related homicides has remained relatively flat for two decades, he said. "I don't mean to minimize the horror of these events or the pain and suffering of victims, but schools are safe, safer than other places that our children spend time," he said. "For some kids, school is even safer than their home." Corzine said he sees some value in Everytown’s calculations -- but also pitfalls. On the one hand, "they are a valid indicator of the ease with which firearms enter the school environment in the United States compared to other highly developed nations." By the same token, though, "it is misleading to use the 74 school shootings in a context that explicitly or implicitly equates them with Sandy Hook." Our ruling A statistic calculated by Everytown for Gun Safety, and shared widely on social media, said that there have been 74 "school shootings in America since Sandy Hook." The group’s figure is accurate only if you use a broad definition of "school shooting" that includes such incidents as suicides, accidents and spillover from adjacent criminal activity. The figure has some value in quantifying the proximity of guns to school campuses, but the group makes a significant stretch by tying the statistic so closely to the mass shooting at Sandy Hook. By doing this, the group closely associates the statistic with planned mass shootings targeting students and school staff -- a category that, using a more strict definition, accounts for only 10 of the 74 incidents. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-02752	A gun "background check is futile. Something like 42 (people during the) last year … were prosecuted for trying to buy a gun with a criminal record out of 11 million."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2013/dec/15/larry-pratt/gun-supporter-says-few-prosecutions-show-backgroun/	Fox News Sunday used the one-year anniversary of the school shooting in Newtown, Conn., to renew the gun debate. Carlee Soto, the sister of Newtown victim and Sandy Hook Elementary School teacher Victoria Soto, and Mark Kelly, the husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords, both advocated for a failed Senate bill that would expand background checks on gun purchases. Larry Pratt, the executive director of Gun Owners of America, countered by calling for more guns in schools. He also dismissed the Senate legislation. "The background check is futile," Pratt said. "Something like 42 (people during the) last year … were prosecuted for trying to buy a gun with a criminal record out of 11 million." This talking point came up quite a bit in the months after the Sandy Hook shooting. The numbers aren’t far off, but they also doesn’t get at the heart of what a background check accomplishes. If 42 people out of 11 million were the only ones deterred from legally buying a gun because of a background check, then maybe "futile" would be an accurate description. After all, that’s only 1 in every 262,000 applications. But before we get into the other elements of a background check, let’s get the numbers right. Since the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 went into effect, federally licensed firearms dealers and state and federal authorities have used the FBI background check system to determine whether an individual can legally purchase a firearm. Pratt’s claim that 11 million background checks were conducted during the last year of record is a high estimate, but not by much. According to the U.S. Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Statistics, it’s actually around 10.4 million in 2010, the latest year on file. He’s also not far off on the number of prosecutions. A report by the Regional Justice Information Service "Enforcement of the Brady Act, 2010," showed 62 charges were filed by U.S. attorneys across the country in response to background checks. Of those charges, 18 were dropped, putting the tally at 44, a couple more than Pratt’s number. However, that doesn’t include local charges in states that conduct their own checks. As PolitiFact noted earlier this year while conducting a similar fact-check on comments from Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., that’s likely to increase the total number of prosecutions. In his research, Ronald Frandsen, grants administrator for the Regional Justice Information Service, found that in the four states that voluntarily report local cases — Colorado, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Virginia — 1,520 arrests were noted. Another 17 states that conduct background checks themselves were not included. "You’d have to say (the total number of arrests) would be higher," Frandsen told PolitiFact at the time. "There’s no question." Pratt is also ignoring all the individuals who were denied weapons up front because they could not pass a background check. In 2010, 153,000 applications to purchase a firearm or obtain a permit were blocked. The most common reason an application is denied is because the customer has a previous felony conviction or indictment, making up almost half of all denials for federal checks and one-third of state checks. It’s still a small percentage of all the applications processed, about 1.5 percent, but it’s much more than Pratt lets one believe. Our ruling Pratt said "the background check is futile. Something like 42 (people during the) last year of record were prosecuted for trying to buy a gun with a criminal record out of 11 million." He is a little off in his numbers, but they’re close. However, his statement also paints just a partial picture of the entire background check procedure and how authorities and gun sellers use it to keep criminals from purchasing weapons. To make a bold claim like the system is "futile" and then leave out the thousands of individuals denied a firearm because of a background check is misleading. We rate it Half True.

pomt-07001	"Dubious taxpayer-funded stimulus projects in Rhode Island include … $250,000 to provide digital television to the state’s inmate population."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2011/jul/10/ocean-state-policy-research-institute/watchdog-group-says-ri-used-stimulus-funds-250000-/	Flip through "The 2011 Rhode Island Piglet Book" and you’ll find hundreds of examples of what the Ocean State Policy Research Institute (OSPRI) considers wasteful spending of taxpayer dollars OSPRI, which says it is devoted to "the principles of free enterprise, limited government, and traditional American values," published the 39-page booklet in June with the support of Citizens Against Government Waste, a national conservative nonprofit group. The report focuses on municipal, state and federal spending in Rhode Island. The authors say the booklet "exposes over 300 pork projects, bungled boondoggles, bad ideas and examples of abuse of power that have resulted in the waste, fraud and abuse of more than $600 million of the taxpayers’ hard-earned money." We can’t check on every example. But we were intrigued by one, related to federal stimulus spending, that OSPRI executive director Mike Stenhouse cited when publicizing the report on an appearance on WHJJ-920 AM’s "The Helen Glover Show." The report says: "The stimulus’ $2 billion price tag alone doesn’t tell the whole story of how tax dollars were spent – and wasted – in Rhode Island. In order to see the pork projects and frivolous spending hidden in the state’s stimulus spending, it is necessary to take a closer look." Included on a list of "some of the more dubious taxpayer-funded stimulus projects" is "$250,000 to provide digital television to the state’s inmate population." Our antennae perked up: Did the state channel stimulus funds to digital TV for prisoners? The item in the report is footnoted and includes the first in a series of links that bring you to an OSPRI Web page with what appears to be a list of Department of Corrections projects. It includes $250,000 "to convert digital television signal." We inquired about the project at the state Office of Economic Recovery and Reinvestment, which administers spending under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) -- the formal name of the stimulus program. Deputy director Laurie Petrone reviewed records and got back to us. "Under ARRA, they are not receiving any funds for that," she said. So we contacted the corrections department "There were no ARRA funds used for the digital conversion project," said spokeswoman Tracey Zeckhausen. When we related this to Stenhouse, he sent an e-mail with an attached state document that he said was where "the specific information was originally drawn from." The document heading reads, "Office of Economic Recovery and Reinvestment" and beneath that it says "submitted requests under review, state agencies and state university." Beneath that, in larger red type, the phrase "submitted requests under review" is repeated. Petrone said those headings reflect that the document was merely a list of projects that various state agencies and institutions proposed as possible candidates for stimulus funding. The state compiled the list as it prepared to apply for stimulus money, she said. Ultimately, many did not receive ARRA funds, including the requested $250,000 for digital TV conversion at the Adult Correctional Institutions, she said. The corrections department did undertake the project, however, using $143,000 in capital funds and $31,000 from its general fund to pay for work that ended up costing $174,000, Zeckhausen said. The sources of those revenues were state taxpayer dollars, she said. The project, completed in early 2009, prepared the Adult Correctional Institutions for the federally mandated deadline for full-power TV stations to switch from analog to digital broadcasts. After that date, June 13, 2009, the prisons’ analog TVs -- the only kind available at that time -- would have been unable to receive over-the-air broadcasts without special converter boxes and antennae. And, Zeckhausen noted, "They do not get cable." The ACI’s 3,200 inmates watch TV in common areas and in their cells. In minimum security, as many as eight inmates may live in the same dormitory room and share one television. Inmates in old maximum security, who have no cellmates, have the exclusive choice of what to watch. The 2009 project involved improvements to the ACI’s existing antenna system, including rewiring and installing new components for reception of over-the-air digital broadcasts, Zeckhausen said. TVs are connected to the antenna wiring via a cable plugged into a cell wall. Today, inmates can purchase converter boxes for their analog TVs for $69 or buy new 13-inch digital flat-screen TVs for $191 (with clear backs to prevent the hiding of contraband). The TVs can receive about two dozen stations, including NBC, CBS, ABC and PBS outlets in Providence and Boston. Why should inmates get to watch TV at all? "An idle inmate can present a security risk. Keeping prisoners occupied is critical, and the opportunity to watch TV is one way to do that," Corrections Director A. T. Wall said in a statement. He also said that TV "keeps inmates...in tune with current events, another factor in preparing them for life beyond the walls." But our mission here isn’t to judge whether such spending is, or is not, "dubious." It’s to check on the accuracy of the report’s claim. Here’s what we found: OSPRI got two things right. The project was "taxpayer-funded" and it did provide digital television to the state’s inmates. But it got two big things wrong. First, the project didn’t cost $250,000. The actual price was $174,000. And more important, it is not a "stimulus project." OSPRI should have heeded the cautionary note in big red type on the document it cited. A call to the Office of Economic Recovery and Reinvestment would have cleared that up. When we told Stenhouse what we learned, he downplayed the source of the project’s funding. The main purpose of the Piglet book, he said, is " to list federal, state, and local expenditures of taxpayer dollars in R.I." Isn’t the purpose of a 38-page report with 412 footnotes to get the facts right? Furthermore, the OSPRI report pointedly described federal stimulus spending as a "litany of pricey and preposterous handouts" in highlighting 17 local projects it said benefited from the program. When we asked Petrone about those other items, she said only 2 of the 17 won funding through the state. We can’t delve into those here, but we’re checking into whether any secured stimulus funding through some other means, if they received any public funding at all, and whether the projects were actually undertaken. (Download the report, go to page 32 and let us know the ones you’re interested in.) The Piglet Book authors got a bit lucky on this one. The fact that the ACI completed the project without stimulus funding saved their bacon from the flames of a Pants on Fire ruling. We rate this one False (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-03798	"Quite frankly, it was during the Bush years of spending, multiplied now by the Obama years that we have this mess."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2013/mar/26/steve-latourette/former-rep-steve-latourette-says-spending-during-b/	Since retiring from Congress at the beginning of this year because he was frustrated by partisan gridlock, former Bainbridge Township GOP Rep. Steve LaTourette has become head of the Republican Main Street Partnership, where he has urged more centrism and cooperation between Republicans and Democrats. In that capacity, LaTourette has dismissed Republicans who refuse to compromise with Democrats as "chuckleheads" who are hindering governance. In a March 17 segment on "Fox News Sunday", LaTourette debated those views with a leader of the Tea Party movement, FreedomWorks president and CEO Matt Kibbe. Kibbe told LaTourette that "the only reason we are talking about a balanced budget, the only reason that we’re having a serious debate about $16-plus trillion in debt, is because of the Tea Party class in 2010, and the folks we had in 2012." "We’re never going to fix the problem just by pretending that the process of bipartisanship somehow gets to real problems, because that’s how we got here," Kibbe said. "This crisis was created by both Republicans and Democrats not willing to make tough choices." "That flies in the face of what we did in the 1990s," LaTourette responded. "Bill Clinton was the president, John Kasich was the budget chair and Newt Gingrich was the speaker and we created the Balanced Budget Act in 1997. And quite frankly, it was during the Bush years of spending, multiplied now by the Obama years that we have this mess." LaTourette went on to tell Kibbe the Tea Party is an important part of the Republican Party, but he believes "just saying no doesn’t get you anything, and it creates these false crises. And you can get past the false crises if you work something out." In light of Kibbe’s skepticism that bipartisanship can fix the nation’s budget problems, we thought it was worth examining LaTourette’s assertion that Republicans in Congress worked with the Democratic-controlled White House in 1997 to balance the budget, and "it was during the Bush years of spending, multiplied by the Obama years that we now have this mess." According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 was designed to shave $127 billion from the federal budget deficit between 1998 and 2002, largely by slowing the growth of the Medicare program. After that agreement, the federal government’s revenue exceeded its spending from 1998 to 2001. Throughout that period, Clinton controlled the White House and Republicans controlled the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. President George W. Bush took office in January 2001, after the 2001 budget had been assembled by Clinton and the GOP Congress. As noted by FactCheck.org, the debt the government owes to the public decreased during this period of surpluses, but was not erased. In 2001, CBO predicted the government would run a total of $5.6 trillion in surpluses from 2001-11, including a surplus of nearly $900 billion in 2011 alone. It forecast that the federal government’s debt would be erased by 2006, and there’d be a $2.3 trillion surplus by 2011. Instead the federal government ran $6.1 trillion in deficits, including deficits exceeding $1 trillion in each of 2009-11. Numerous organizations have analyzed what went wrong. In an April 2011 report, the nonpartisan Pew Charitable Trusts said a variety of factors are responsible for the growth in federal debt since 2001. Its fiscal analysis put two thirds of the blame on legislation adopted since January 2001 that enacted roughly three dollars of new spending for every two dollars in tax cuts. It traced 13 percent of the increased debt to tax cuts that were implemented from 2001 to 2003, 10 percent to spending caused by military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, 6 percent to the Recovery Act, 3 percent to tax legislation adopted in 2010, and 2 percent to establishment of prescription drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries. A different nonprofit, nonpartisan economic research organization called e21 says the projected surpluses did not materialize because forecasters made inaccurate projections, such as failing to predict "the bursting of the 1990s dot-com stock bubble, which by itself eliminated the surpluses projected for 2002 and 2003." It said that spending increases were responsible for nearly half of the evaporated surplus, that off-base projections caused about 27 percent, and tax relief caused 24 percent. "One major factor that worsened the fiscal outlook was a large increase in federal discretionary spending," said the e21 report authored by former Bush administration economic advisor Charles Blahous. "Much of this, of course, happened after the United States was attacked on September 11, 2001. The U.S. thereafter conducted major military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, and also increased expenditures on homeland security. These policies were enacted with bipartisan support, including bipartisan decisions to add their costs to the federal deficit. Discretionary spending increases further accelerated in 2009-11." It is clear that federal budget surpluses disappeared after 2001 for a variety of reasons. During last year’s presidential contest, a great deal of political wind was expended over whether Bush or Barack Obama was more to blame for elevated government spending since 2001. Because LaTourette said they both left a mess, it’s not necessary here to dissect how much harm was done during each presidency. It is worth noting that Bush had a Republican Congress to back his initiatives during most of his presidency. Partway through his first term, Democrats assumed control of the U.S Senate when Vermont’s Jim Jeffords left the Republican party and announced he’d caucus with Democrats. Republicans controlled all three branches of government from 2003 through 2007. During Bush’s last two years, Democrats controlled the House of Representatives and Senate. Obama began his term with his fellow Democrats in charge of the House and Senate. Two years later, Republicans took charge of the House of Representatives, though Democrats retained control of the U.S. Senate. That scenario persists today. LaTourette is correct that the federal budget was balanced in the 1990s, at a time when a Democratic president was forced to find common ground with Republicans who controlled Congress. He’s also correct that the nation’s budget woes have escalated since then. Spending is no doubt a major factor, but there are a variety of reasons. With that point of clarification, we rule that LaTourette’s statement is Mostly True.	None	Steve LaTourette	None	None	None	2013-03-26T16:49:20	2013-03-17	['Barack_Obama', 'George_W._Bush']
pomt-12791	"The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know. And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/16/donald-trump/trump-hints-stock-market-record-high-linked-presid/	As he lauded his first month in office, President Donald Trump reaffirmed his promise to create jobs by citing the progress of the stock market as signaling a promising business environment. "The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know. And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world," Trump said in a press conference Feb. 16. "To me means something much different than it used to. It used to mean, ‘Oh, that's good.’ Now it means, ‘That's good for jobs.’ Very different." Trump had sent a similar message earlier in the day, tweeting: "Stock market hits new high with longest winning streak in decades. Great level of confidence and optimism - even before tax plan rollout!" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com All three major stock indexes closed at record highs for five days in row on Feb. 15. But does Trump get credit for that, as he suggested? Experts told us there are nuances. Stock market winning streaks The Dow Jones Industrial Average includes the stocks of the 30 largest and most powerful companies in the country (Wal-Mart, Disney, Pfizer, for example). The Standard & Poor's 500 (S&P 500) consists of the 500 most commonly traded stocks and represents about 80 percent of the total value of U.S. stock markets. The Nasdaq Composite Index features mostly technology companies. All three major indexes on Feb. 15 closed at record highs for the fifth consecutive day. It was the first time the three indexes achieved concurrent high records for that length of time since January 1992, according to analyses reported by CNNMoney and MarketWatch. MarketWatch countered part of Trump’s tweet, saying that the Feb. 15 high really wasn’t "the longest winning streak in decades." "Rather, it’s the best record-setting stretch in a quarter century … In terms of winning streaks, the S&P has risen for seven consecutive trading days for its longest stretch of up days since September 2013, when it also rose for seven straight sessions. That’s according to Dow Jones data," wrote MarketWatch’s Victor Reklaitis, also noting Dow gains for five days straight and a Nasdaq seven-session winning streak. (More on the those winning streaks here and here.) Experts told us that investors are at least somewhat hopeful about Trump’s promised tax and regulation cuts, though that’s not the sole driver of the stock market highs. Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 30 directing that for every one new regulation issued, at least two prior regulations be eliminated. Trump says "wasteful and unnecessary" regulation kills jobs and stop businesses from growing. Trump also has promised to slash the business tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent and to eliminate the corporate alternative minimum tax. In meetings with CEOs of different industries, Trump has reiterated that tax cuts are coming and that he’d like to get rid of 75 percent of regulations, "maybe more." He has also tweeted about a border tax for imports. "I would definitely say Trump gets credit," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. The S&P 500 returns are up 3.8 percent from Jan. 20, the day Trump took office, said Stovall, who has studied the market’s returns during each president’s first month dating back to President Herbert Hoover in 1929. Amid the recession and during Obama's first month in office in 2009, returns fell 9.4 percent, Stovall said. They rose 1.4 percent during Obama's first month in office in his second term, according to Stovall's study. Tim Duy, an economist and professor at the University of Oregon, said the economy was poised for relative strength as the end of 2016 approached, regardless of Trump’s inauguration. "Underlying growth remained solid, and it increasingly looked like some of the inventory overhang of the previous year was easing," Duy said. Manufacturing and services sector surveys were going up, and two factors that’d been weighing on stocks -- decline in oil prices and strength of the dollar -- waned over 2016, Duy added. "The economy was not headed into a recession and, in the absence of a recession, stocks are more likely to go up than down," Duy said. "In other words, this was largely baked into the cake regardless of who won the election. Trump was handed a solid economy at the macro level." It’s still reasonable to believe that hopes of tax cuts have boosted stocks to some degree, but it wasn’t the dominant factor, Duy said. Economic news has been nuanced in recent weeks. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show 227,000 jobs were added in January 2017. The unemployment rate in January was 4.8 percent, slightly higher than the previous month but based on 584,000 more people looking for jobs after accounting for annual adjustments to population controls, according to Feb. 3 BLS figures. "Consumer confidence decreased in January, after reaching a 15-year high in December," said in a Jan. 31 statement Lynn Franco, director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board, which presents the Consumer Confidence Index based on a monthly survey. "The decline in confidence was driven solely by a less optimistic outlook for business conditions, jobs, and especially consumers’ income prospects. Consumers’ assessment of current conditions, on the other hand, improved in January," Franco said. "Despite the retreat in confidence, consumers remain confident that the economy will continue to expand in the coming months." Trump certainly isn’t the first to boast about the stock market’s performance. In 2015, Hillary Clinton claimed the stock market does better when there’s a Democratic president. While several calculations backed her statement, we rated her claim Mostly True because experts said several other factors are key in determining performance, including timing, policies and international economic trends. Our ruling Trump said, "The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know. And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world." The three major stock indexes, Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all closed at record highs for five consecutive days. While investors are optimistic about Trump’s plans to cut taxes and eliminate regulations, experts say other factors play influential roles in the stock market. After rising in December, consumer confidence dropped in January, though consumers are confident the economy will expand in coming months. Trump’s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1d390b70-d630-4f46-b741-dc15ff7f33e7	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2017-02-16T17:12:05	2017-02-16	['None']
pomt-05721	"When my grandfather came to this country back in 1925, there were no government benefits."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/06/rick-santorum/santorum-says-when-his-grandfather-came-us-1925-th/	On a number of occasions, Rick Santorum has used speeches to tout the theme of self-reliance and limited government, including one claim about government programs at the time his grandfather immigrated to the United States. Here’s an excerpt from his Feb. 29, 2012, speech near Knoxville, Tenn.: "Eight or nine months ago, President (Barack) Obama, responding to Paul Ryan’s budget, gave a lecture on all these wonderful programs that Ryan was going to cut or change. Programs like unemployment insurance and food stamps and housing programs and Medicaid and Medicare. He listed them all. He said America is a better country because of these commitments. And then he read off his teleprompter, he said, ‘I will go one step further. America was not a great country until these commitments.’ "So the president of the United States did not believe America was great until people came into power in Washington who raised your taxes, took your freedom and then redistributed your hard-earned dollars to someone that Washington believed deserved it more than you did. In his mind, that’s the greatness of America. "That’s what makes America not different or great -- it makes it like every other country in the world. And by the way, all of us came from those countries because we didn’t want those countries to take care of us. When my grandfather came to this country back in 1925, there were no government benefits." There’s a lot to digest here, but we’ll focus in this item on whether it’s true that when Santorum’s grandfather arrived in the United States in 1925, "there were no government benefits." We contacted the Santorum campaign about this statement but received no response. But did hear from a dozen historians and economists and read a number of scholarly papers on the subject and found that the pre-1925 history of social welfare spending in the United States was complicated and nuanced. There were two major sources of payments to individuals prior to 1925 -- veterans benefits and workers' compensation. We’ll take a closer look here: Veterans benefits: The federal government began funding benefits for Civil War veterans in 1862, initially based on a physical examination to determine the severity of a wartime injury. In time, however, the threshold for receiving a benefit was lowered -- first to less obvious wartime ailments, then to retroactive wartime claims that had never been previously been reported and then, in 1890, to servicemembers who had a disability not related to their military service. "Pensioners and federal expenditures swelled after 1890, and the amount the government spent on pensions that year alone was $106 million," Peter Blanck and Chen Song wrote in a 2003 paper in the William and Mary Law Review. The 1890 Disability Pension Act, they wrote, was called the most expensive and liberal pension measure "ever passed by any legislative body in the world" at the time. The law was expanded further in 1904 through an executive order by President Theodore Roosevelt, defining "disability" to include old age, as long as the beneficiary had at least 90 days of service and an honorable discharge. Three years later, the 1890 law was replaced by a new one that granted pensions to veterans over 62, with increases in payments as they aged. "In 1907, it was estimated that the 1890 Act had cost more than $1 billion," Blanck and Song wrote. "Between 1870 and 1910, the proportion of veterans receiving pensions rose from 5 percent to 93 percent." A veterans’ health system also began in the aftermath of World War I. This was not a trivial portion of the population. In a different paper, University of Arizona economist Price V. Fishback wrote that "roughly 40 to 48 percent of the elderly in the North and Midwest in the early 1900s were receiving pensions" through the system. This was such a significant group, Fishback wrote, that "it likely altered the political calculus in ways that delayed the adoption of old-age assistance and pensions in the United States for a decade or two." The presence of federal benefits created, and reinforced, a broad interest group. "At its height in the 1890s, the (Union veteran) pension scheme consumed almost half of the federal budget and was intimately linked to the Republican Party's strategy to maintain the soldier vote and hold the White House," Blanck and Song wrote, adding that "it galvanized interests of the constituency of disabled (Union) veterans, who were increasingly important to the Republican and Democratic parties in the upcoming national elections." Worker compensation: A federal worker-compensation law to help civilian government workers injured or made sick on the job was adopted in 1908, according to a history on the Social Security Administration website. Starting in 1911, states began passing such laws, and by 1929, laws were in effect in all but four states. Some states ran the compensation systems themselves, others required employers to pay into private plans, and some gave employers a choice between the two. While these are the clearest examples that run counter to Santorum’s claim, there are a few other efforts worth noting. Local government aid to the poor: During the period Santorum is talking about, local governments were responsible for providing benefits to the poor, Fishback told PolitiFact. These payments tended to be modest. Fischback cited a study by Brendan Livingston of Rowan University that looked at welfare policies in Massachusetts -- generally considered the most generous state in the first decades of the 20th century -- and found that local governments were spending an amount equivalent to about 0.5 percent to 1 percent of all income earned by state residents on relief for the poor. Private charities were spending at about twice that rate. By 1925, most states also had "mothers' pensions" on the books, which allowed widows to raise their children without having to put them in orphanages, according to Fishback’s paper. By then, a handful of states also had means-tested pensions for the elderly, and a sizable number had pensions for the blind. And states or municipalities often operated mental hospitals, old-age homes, orphanages and general hospitals, all for the public benefit. "The 1920s were years when state and municipal expenditures expanded rapidly and public and social services continued the professionalization that had started mainly after World War I," said Michael B. Katz, a historian at the University of Pennsylvania. Schools and universities: While education isn’t a direct payment to individuals, it’s worth pointing out that they represented a government-provided benefit in kind. "Primary and secondary education were already overwhelmingly paid for by taxes from the late 1800s on," said Peter Lindert, an economist at the University of California at Davis. Meanwhile, higher education had land-grant subsidies -- federally backed institutions dating back to the Morrill Land-Grant Acts of 1862 and 1890. "Because they were public institutions, tuition was cheaper on account of public subsidies," said Gary Gerstle, a historian and political scientist at Vanderbilt University. "This was clearly a government benefit." Health funding for mothers and newborns. In 1921, President Warren G. Harding signed the Sheppard-Towner Maternity and Infancy Protection Act, which gave states matching federal funds to build and operate prenatal and child health care centers. The bill grew out of an investigation begun under President William Howard Taft, which found that "nearly 80 percent of U.S. women did not receive proper prenatal care -- a fact starkly illustrated during World War I when thousands of men failed to pass their physicals due to afflictions stemming from inadequate medical care as children." Adding it up How much did such expenditures add up to? Researchers from the Urban Institute pointed us to old editions of the Statistical Abstract of the United States. One table shows a compilation for expenses for federal, state and local governments for selected years between 1902 and 1970. We chose 1922, the year closest to 1925, and found that the "public assistance" category amounted to $57 million, the "other public welfare" category totaled $71 million and "veterans services otherwise not classified" was $505 million. Combined, these three categories were 6.8 percent of expenditures at the three levels of government combined. Even if this overstates the amount, it’s clear that the amount of government benefits was not zero. Santorum does have a point that social welfare spending by 1925 was relatively small compared to what it would ultimately become, because two major programs, Social Security and Medicare, didn't start until later. "The most obvious feature of social expenditures at the turn of the 20th century was how much smaller they were in comparisons with the levels at the turn of the 21st century," Fishback wrote. As we noted in a previous fact-check of Santorum, federal entitlement programs have grown significantly, particularly after the establishment of Social Security in the 1930s and Medicare in the 1960s. In 1958, such payments accounted for 25.4 percent of the federal budget and grew to 65.1 percent in fiscal year 2011. This is not purely a result of policy decisions; it’s also a result of technological advances and demographic trends. The cost of medical care has risen significantly over the years due to technology and advances in treatments (a topic we earlier discussed here), and the percentage of the population that is elderly has grown from 4.1 percent in 1900 to 12.2 percent in 2000. It’s also worth noting that the specific individual Santorum cited -- his newly arrived immigrant grandfather -- wouldn’t have benefited from military pensions or a land-grant college upon his arrival on these shores, and his ability to collect worker compensation would have depended on what state he lived in upon his arrival. Similarly, the local aid to the poor he would have qualified for would have varied significantly depending on what city or county he lived in, and it would have been small by the standards of later decades. "I’d go easy on Santorum for this one," said Brookings Institution economist Henry Aaron. "There wasn’t much back then." "Santorum is not alone in making these mistakes," Fishback told PolitiFact. "I would bet that the vast majority of people including many social scientists do not know what our social welfare system looked like in 1925." Still, Aaron and Fishback are among many economists we contacted who were skeptical about the underlying message of Santorum’s claim -- that life was better before the New Deal programs of the 1930s and the Great Society programs of the 1960s. Dean Baker, an economist with the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, notes that inflation-adjusted per capita disposable income grew from $6,537 in 1929 to $32,659 in 2011 -- a fivefold increase. "Life is unquestionably better, unless you think two-earner households, busy spouses, and dirtier homes are not worth SUVs, air conditioning, and weekend in Paris," said Douglas J. Besharov, a public policy professor at the University of Maryland. Our ruling Contrary to what Santorum said, millions of Americans in 1925 would have either qualified for benefits directly, such as payments to veterans, or have been protected by workers' compensation laws that provided benefits to those who became disabled by their jobs. And state and local governments had the longstanding role of paying support to people who were disabled or indigent. This provides a much more complex picture than Santorum is painting.

pomt-14677	Says Sen. Ted Cruz used to be "in favor of birthright citizenship" but is now against it.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/15/marco-rubio/rubio-mischaracterizes-cruzs-statement-birthright-/	Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz picked up their immigration battle at another presidential debate, with Rubio accusing his rival of flip-flopping on a laundry list of positions, including birthright citizenship. "You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship. Now you say that you are against it," Rubio said as Cruz vigorously shook his head. The question takes on special significance in this case, since Cruz, born in Canada to an American mother and Cuban father, has had his own American citizenship questioned by frontrunner Donald Trump. We decided to check if Cruz has changed his political position on whether the children of immigrants should be American citizens if they are born in the United States. We found Cruz has shifted his talk about birthright citizenship, but it’s not in the way Rubio described on national television. Campaign comments When we asked Rubio’s campaign about the accusation, they sent us a list of attacks about Cruz allegedly switching positions on a host of issues. But the claim boils down to a 2011 radio interview on The Duke Machado Show during Cruz’s Senate campaign. The show’s host asked Cruz whether the issue of birthright citizenship in the 14th Amendment should be changed. The amendment states, "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside." Now, Cruz didn’t offer outright support for birthright citizenship. Cruz, a former prosecutor, said it would be difficult to revisit the provision. "The 14th Amendment provides for birthright citizenship. I’ve looked at the legal arguments against it, and I will tell you as a Supreme Court litigator, those arguments are not very good," he said. "As much as someone may dislike the policy of birthright citizenship, it’s in the U.S. Constitution. And I don’t like it when federal judges set aside the Constitution because their policy preferences are different. "And so in my view I think it is a mistake for conservatives to be focusing on trying to fight what the Constitution says on birthright citizenship. I think we are far better off focusing on securing the border, because birthright citizenship wouldn’t be an issue if we didn’t have people coming in illegally." The full interview isn’t available, so we can’t say what else Cruz may have said on the subject during the 2011 broadcast. Pressed to clarify his view during the current presidential campaign, Cruz gave a series of interviews in August 2015 to show he opposed the practice. "We should end granting automatic birthright citizenship to the children of those who are here illegally," Cruz said in an Aug. 19 radio interview on "The Michael Medved Show." Medved asked if Cruz would change the Constitution if he could: "I think that it is possible, but any constitutional amendment, by its nature, is difficult to achieve. Look, I would note, that has been my position from the very first day of my running for the Senate." Cruz repeated his position Aug. 23 on Face the Nation, saying while he is against giving the kids of undocumented immigrants citizenship, the real problem is a matter of preventing illegal immigration with better border security. "I think birthright citizenship as a policy matter doesn't make sense," Cruz said. "We have right now upwards of 12 million people living here illegally. It doesn't make any sense that our law automatically grants citizenship to their children because what it does is it incentivizes additional illegal immigration." Two days later, he told Fox News’ Megyn Kelly that birthright citizenship is an incentive for undocumented immigrants to come to America and that "we ought to change that policy" but that "there is a legal dispute about the best means to do it." "There are serious scholars who argue that Congress could do it through statute defining what it means to be subject to the jurisdiction, the language of the 14th Amendment," he said. "There are other serious constitutional scholars who argue the only way to change it is through a constitutional amendment. My view is, we should pursue either or both, whichever is effective; What matters is that we should change the policy so we are not rewarding and incentivizing and encouraging more illegal immigration." Is it a flip-flop? Some conservative media outlets, and Rubio, have said this amounts to a "flip-flop" for Cruz. But it’s not that straight-forward. At most, Cruz said in 2011 he didn’t think changing the 14th Amendment was feasible from a legal standpoint, and conservatives would be better off focusing on securing the borders. We couldn’t find any statements by Cruz that showed anything resembling support for birthright citizenship, and we don’t read his resistance to fighting a constitutional amendment as support for the concept in the way his critics do. That said, there has been a shift on one thing: Cruz now says he supports pursuing a change, either with an amendment or legislation. Cruz’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment by deadline. Our ruling Rubio said Cruz used to be "in favor of birthright citizenship" but is now against it. He was referring to a 2011 radio interview in which Cruz said birthright citizenship was guaranteed by the 14th Amendment, and it was better for conservatives to focus on border security instead of trying to change the Constitution. He has since insisted he opposed birthright citizenship then and opposes it now. We can’t find evidence that contradicts him. Cruz apparently changed his mind on at least one thing: He has said he now supports Congress pursuing a way to change the policy. While that raises questions on some details about Cruz’s position, it’s different than what Rubio claimed. We rate Rubio’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-05848	Says a U.S. Supreme Court justice suggested that some U.S. cases will be decided based on South African law.	false	/florida/statements/2012/feb/14/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-us-supreme-court-justice-south-african/	Florida U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio spoke to his fellow Republican brethren at the Conservative Political Action Conference -- the annual gathering of big-name conservatives. In his speech Rubio defended those who believe in the Constitution. Let’s make that crystal clear -- the U.S. Constitution. "So the majority of Americans are conservatives," Rubio said Feb. 9, 2012. "They believe in things like the Constitution. I know that’s weird to some people but they believe in it. Of course, if you listen to one of our Supreme Court Justices recently she believes that. ...’’ At this point, the audience interrupted Rubio with boos. "Yeah," Rubio continued. "Let me just say if you are an appellate lawyer, you need to brush up on your South African law because that is how some cases apparently are going to be decided here going forward. Anyway, where was I? Oh yeah -- America." We wondered what Rubio was talking about; it sounded like he was saying that a Supreme Court justice had suggested that future cases will be decided based on South African law. (We fact-checked whether the majority of Americans are conservatives in a separate report.) Rubio didn’t name the justice in that part of his speech, but it didn’t take long to find a flurry of media reports about comments U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg made on Egyptian TV, in which she mentioned the South African Constitution. But when we listened to her entire interview, we found that her point didn’t relate to decisions about U.S. cases at all. Rubio spokesman Alex Conant told us in an email that "Ginsburg recently praised the South African constitution, said it was better than ours." He also pointed to this post in Foreign Policy magazine, which reviewed the response of conservative blogs to her comments. When we contacted Conant again and told him that we thought Rubio’s claim was inaccurate, Conant replied, "I think it was pretty clear that Sen. Rubio was joking." (Watch Rubio's remarks and decide for yourself.) What Ginsburg said Once an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, Ginsburg was nominated to the Supreme Court in 1993 by President Bill Clinton. She is widely viewed as one of the court’s most liberal justices. Ginsburg went to Egypt in January 2012 to meet with Egyptian judges and legal experts, and while there gave an interview to Al Hayat TV. The interviewer asked Ginsburg her advice about whether Egypt should look to other countries’ constitutions as a model. Ginsberg replied: "You should certainly be aided by all the constitution-writing that has gone on since the end of World War II. I would not look to the U.S. Constitution, if I were drafting a constitution in the year 2012. I might look at the constitution of South Africa. That was a deliberate attempt to have a fundamental instrument of government that embraced basic human rights (and) had an independent judiciary. It really is, I think, a great piece of work that was done. Much more recently than the U.S. Constitution is Canada, (which) has a charter of rights and freedoms (and) dates from 1982. You would almost certainly look at the European Convention on Human Rights.....I'm a very strong believer from listening and learning from others.'' During the 18-minute TV segment, Ginsburg made several other comments -- many positive -- about the U.S. Constitution: • The Egyptian Constitution "should safeguard basic fundamental human rights, like our First Amendment is the right to speak freely, to publish freely without the government as a censor." • "One of my favorite provisions in our Constitution is the one that says that government shall not deny to any person the equal protection of the laws." • The U.S. Constitution includes a separation of powers between Congress, the president and the judiciary, and the judiciary has independence. • "We have the oldest written constitution still in force in the world. And it's a constitution that starts out with three wonderful words: ‘We the people." • The men who wrote the U.S. Constitution were "some of the most brilliant minds" and "very wise." Ginsburg also noted that at the time the U.S. Constitution was written in 1787, slavery was legal, and women weren’t part of the Constitutional Convention (though Ginsburg notes that John Adams' wife Abigail urged him to not forget the ladies as he wrote it). "The genius of the Constitution, I think, is that it had this notion of who composes 'We the People.' It has expanded, expanded over the years. So now it includes people who were left out at the beginning: Native Americans were left out, certainly people held in human bondage, women, people who were newcomers to our shore," she said. The left and right respond to Ginsburg Ginsburg’s comments set off fire from the right. Consider these headlines: "Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Anti U.S. Constitution" wrote the Liberally Conservative blog, and from U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., posting on RedState, "Our constitution is not irrelevant, Justice Ginsburg." Mathew Staver, founder and chairman of the Liberty Counsel and Dean of Liberty University School of Law, said, "For a sitting U.S. Supreme Court Justice to speak derisively about the Constitution she is sworn to uphold is distressing, to say the least." On the left, Media Matters said the right was showing "misplaced outrage" and linked to the blog of Eugene Volokh, a law professor at University of California at Los Angeles. (Volokh told us he considers himself center-right or libertarian-conservative.) Volokh argued that Ginsburg, who swore an oath to uphold the U.S. Constitution, probably thinks it works well for our country. "But why should she (or we) think that the 1787 constitutional text, coupled with the 27 amendments that have come in fits and spurts since then, would necessarily work well for a completely different country today? … None of this tells us whether Justice Ginsburg is committed to following the U.S. Constitution in the U.S. Maybe you think she is so committed and maybe you think she isn’t, but you’d have to figure that out from other sources than from the advice she gives to a different country about whether to adopt the constitutional text in a completely different political and legal requirement." A Boston Globe editorial wrote that there was no outrage when Justice Antonin Scalia told a congressional panel in October 2011: "The bill of rights of the former ‘evil empire,' the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, was much better than ours. I mean it literally: It was much better. We guarantee freedom of speech and of the press. Big deal. They guaranteed freedom of speech, of the press, of street demonstrations and protests, and anyone who is caught trying to suppress criticism of the government will be called to account. Whoa, that is wonderful stuff!'' The Globe explained: "Why no outrage? Because Scalia went on to make the point that the Soviet constitution was nothing but ‘words on paper,' a fig leaf for tyranny. By contrast, America's constitutional system - with its careful separation of powers and government institutions checking and balancing each other - has proved a bulwark against tyranny. Only someone brazenly yanking Scalia's words out of context could have accused him of revering the Kremlin's Potemkin constitution more than the one drafted in Philadelphia in 1787." Our ruling Rubio mentioned a female Supreme Court Judge and then concluded, "if you are an appellate lawyer you need to brush up on your South African law because that is how some cases apparently are going to be decided here going forward." Rubio was implying that Justice Ginsburg favored South African law rather than the U.S. Constitution, and that some cases in the U.S. might be decided based on South African law. Rubio’s spokesman says he was joking, but even a joke can leave some viewers with a false impression. Rubio could have poked fun at Ginsburg’s comments without distorting them. There is nothing in Ginsburg’s interview in which she suggested that any legal matter in the U.S. should be decided based on anything from South African law. Ginsburg was giving advice to another country on how to draft a constitution, and she suggested examples written more recently than the U.S. Constitution. She didn’t dis the U.S. Constitution -- she explained that it was written at a time when slavery was legal and women didn’t have equal rights. In fact, Ginsburg also heaped lots of praise on the U.S. Constitution. We rate this claim False.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2012-02-14T09:00:00	2012-02-09	['United_States', 'South_Africa']
pomt-11346	"In many places, like California, the same person votes many times. You probably heard about that. They always like to say 'oh that's a conspiracy theory.' Not a conspiracy theory, folks. Millions and millions of people."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/apr/06/donald-trump/no-proof-trumps-claim-millions-voted-many-times/	In a speech in West Virginia that was billed as being about tax reform, President Donald Trump continued his refrain about widespread voter fraud by stating that millions of people vote multiple times. "In many places, like California, the same person votes many times," he said. "You probably heard about that. They always like to say 'oh that's a conspiracy theory.' Not a conspiracy theory, folks. Millions and millions of people, and it's very hard because the state guards their records. They don’t want to see it." Is there evidence that millions and millions of people have voted many times? No, there's not. But we will summarize the research on this topic. National experts have said that voter fraud is isolated and rare -- and the same holds true for voting multiple times, a phenomenon called double voting. Double voting -- a person casting more than one ballot in an election -- is not the same thing as a person being registered in more than one state, which often happens when people move. Pew found in 2012 that approximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one state. But as we’ll see, that doesn’t mean that 2.75 million people actually voted more than once. We contacted Trump’s spokesman to ask for evidence and didn’t get a reply. Research on double voting A group of experts in computer science and political science from Stanford and University of Pennsylvania published a paper in 2017 that estimated the prevalence of double voting in the 130 million ballots cast in the 2012 presidential election. The researchers estimated that 33,000 votes, or .02 percent of the votes cast, could have been double votes, but they called that an upper-bound estimate. "We would expect to estimate there were around 33,000 double voters even if there were no actual double votes cast," they wrote. The paper concluded that there was almost no chance that double votes could affect the outcome of a national election. The researchers explained in an essay in Slate that double voting is hard to detect because voting records cannot be easily linked across state lines. Kris Kobach, the Republican secretary of state of Kansas, who helped lead Trump’s now defunct voter fraud commission, promotes the Interstate Crosscheck Program, an ongoing program that coordinates the collection of registration records across states. As of 2014, 28 participating states provided the program with their registration records. The states received a list of registrations in their own state that matched the first name, last name, and date of birth recorded on a registration in another member state. In the 2012 election, Crosscheck flagged more than 1.4 million registrations as potential duplicates that member states should further scrutinize. But the key word there is potential. "In a country where 130 million votes are cast in a presidential election, there is a surprisingly high chance that two ballots cast under the same first name, last name, and date of birth actually belong to two different people," the researchers wrote. "While it is unlikely that any two randomly selected vote records would share a common first name, last name, and birthdate, a sizable number of these cases will occur once we aggregate over the 10 quadrillion pairs of vote records in the population. This phenomenon is what statisticians call the birthday paradox." Investigations of double voting There have been some investigations into double voting, some of which led to prosecutions, but they are rare -- far, far less than millions of votes. The conservative Heritage Foundation keeps a voter fraud database which said it showed 1,071 proven instances of fraud including 961 criminal convictions between the 1980s and 2017. Using the database, we counted 80 criminal conviction cases for duplicate voting between 2001 and 2017. (In a few cases, two individuals were convicted.) The California Secretary of State was investigating 56 allegations of double voting as of March 2017, according to its response to a public records request by CALmatters, a nonprofit journalism venture. The New Hampshire Department of State and Department Safety said in the fall of 2017 that 196 people were being investigated as possibly having voted in New Hampshire and one other state. This information is still under view, and the state expects to announce findings in June. News 21, a national investigative reporting project, found that there had been 13 cases in Arizona prosecuted for double voting, according to a 2016 report. In North Carolina, Verna Roehm, 77, pleaded guilty to voting twice after she admitted that she fulfilled her dying husband’s wish to vote for Mitt Romney in 2012. Voting experts such as Loyola law professor Justin Levitt said that no research backs up Trump’s statement. "There is zero evidence for President Trump’s claim that there are millions and millions of double voters," he said. "Zero." Our ruling Trump said, "In many places, like California, the same person votes many times. You probably heard about that. They always like to say 'oh that's a conspiracy theory.' Not a conspiracy theory, folks. Millions and millions of people. They don’t want to see it." While there have been some investigations into multiple voting allegations, including some convictions, they are rare. We found no evidence that the amount of double voting is anywhere close to millions. We rate this statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-09128	Since 2000, "the Texas clean air program achieved a 22 percent reduction in ozone and a 46 percent decrease in NOx emissions."	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/jun/16/rick-perry/perry-state-has-cut-ozone-22-nitrogen-oxide-emissi/	It's Gov. Rick Perry vs. Washington again, this time in a battle over Texas' compliance with the federal Clean Air Act. A day after the state filed suit to stop the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency from taking over parts of the state program that issues permits for companies to foul the air, Perry touted afresh Texas' progress in reducing pollution levels. Since 2000, Perry said in a press release issued Tuesday, "the Texas clean air program (has) achieved a 22 percent reduction in ozone and a 46 percent decrease in NOx (nitrogen oxide) emissions." The same statistic was cited by Perry in a May 28 letter to President Barack Obama and mentioned in news accounts such as a New York Times article published online June 9. Sounds good, but what do the figures mean? And does the state deserve credit for improvements? First, let's look at the basic science. A goal of the federal Clean Air Act is to reduce the levels of what EPA calls "commonly found air pollutants." Among those is ground-level ozone, which forms when nitrogen oxide emissions mix with volatile organic compounds in the presence of sunlight and heat. Common sources of nitrogen oxides: cars and trucks, power plants and industrial boilers. EPA sets limits on the concentration of ozonethe primary component of smog, in the air. Areas that fail to meet the standard are designated in "nonattainment." Under the Clean Air Act, the state is required to submit plans to EPA that outline how it will clean up areas and meet the federal standard. Katherine Cesinger, a spokeswoman for the governor's office, said Perry's May letter to Obama focuses on ozone levels and nitrogen oxide emissions because "ozone is the only thing that we are in nonattainment for the state. And NOx is a precursor to ozone, so it makes sense to highlight that." Experts agreed with that reasoning. David Allen, a professor of chemical engineering at the University of Texas, said: "Controlling NOx emissions is, in general, the most effective strategy for reducing ozone in Texas. So, the governor was right to focus on NOx." The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality provided us with data showing a 46 percent reduction in emissions of nitrogen oxide from industrial sources such as chemical plants, refineries and electric utility plants between 2000 and 2006. Considering the drop through 2008, the decrease was even bigger: 53 percent. However, industrial sources account for only about a fourth of NOx emissions in Texas. Most come from road vehicles, ships and airplanes, as well as smaller sources such as gas stations and dry cleaners. Susana Hildebrand, TCEQ's chief engineer, told us Perry referenced industrial sources of pollution because that's mainly what the state regulates; the federal government regulates mobile sources. Considering all sources of nitrogen oxide emissions, the total fell 26 percent between 2002 and 2008. (The reduction since 2000 was not available.) As for ozone itself, establishing that statewide measure is complicated. There are about 70 regulatory ozone monitors in Texas, primarily in urban areas, almost all located on or east of the Interstate 35 corridor. The statewide measure is the three-year average of ozone levels from sites with some of the highest readings. TCEQ said it believes the sites were all in Houston or Dallas. The data show a 22 percent reduction in ozone between 2000 and 2008. In short, said UT's Allen, Perry's ozone figure is in line with what the agency and university researchers have found. "All of these measurements paint a consistent picture. Ozone concentrations are going down across the state," he said. Still, some parts of Texas have struggled to meet federal ozone standards. Three regions are currently designated in nonattainment under a limit set by EPA in 1997: Dallas-Forth Worth (nine counties), Houston (eight counties), and Beaumont-Port Arthur (four counties). According to TCEQ, the Beaumont area is being reclassified as in compliance and the Houston area met the standard for the first time in 2009. But a tightening of EPA standards, expected in August, will likely put several more areas, including the five-county Austin region, out of compliance. Next, to what degree were the reductions in ozone and NOx achieved by the state's "clean-air program"? Allen said that it's difficult to say "quantitatively" whether federal or state regulations were primarily responsible. Indeed, we found disagreement among experts on that front. Hildebrand, of TCEQ, said state efforts deserve full credit for the industrial NOx emission reductions, pointing to initiatives designed to bring regions into compliance with federal ozone standards. An example: the Mass Emissions Cap and Trade program, in place in Houston since 2001, which limits NOx emissions from large sources. But Neil Carman, clean air program director of the environmental group Sierra Club of Texas, said the federal government deserves the vast majority of the credit for reducing industrial NOx pollution because state actions have been driven by the Clean Air Act. And vehicle emissions, which are regulated by the feds and are a greater source of NOx pollution than industrial sources, have gone down as well -- 40 percent by TCEQ's measure between 2002 and 2008. Hildebrand acknowledged that has helped improve Texas' ozone picture. Al Armendariz of Dallas, administrator of EPA's multi-state Region 6, which includes Texas, credited all levels of government with hastening the ozone improvements, especially in Dallas and Houston. As examples, he pointed to enforcement actions taken against industry by the federal government that led to facilities' agreeing to major cuts in emissions, as well as state initiatives. The state touts incentive-driven programs such as its Emission Reduction Plan, which has spent more than $760 million since 2000 to help companies retrofit or replace more than 12,000 diesel vehicles with cleaner-burning ones. Despite the ozone improvements, a report released April 28 by the American Lung Association ranked the Houston area as the seventh-worst in the nation for ozone pollution and Dallas-Fort Worth 13th. (The worst six places for ozone were in California.) Of the 30 Texas counties graded by the lung association on their ozone pollution, 21 -- including Travis -- received F's. So how does Perry's statement hold up? The governor accurately cites recent improvements in the state's ozone levels. As for the NOx emissions contributing to ozone levels, his statistic refers to only one source -- industrial -- which he did not note. Nearly three-quarters comes from other sources. Whether the state gets the credit for those improvements is another issue. Even if TCEQ is responsible for the drop in industrial NOx emissions, federal efforts -- namely vehicle emission regulations -- also have helped lower ozone levels. Significantly, the state's ozone-related programs exist to help Texas comply with federal expectations. We rate Perry's statement as Half True.

The Lakewood Democrat put both elements together in his kickoff speechby talking about education. "Just last night, ladies and gentlemen," he said, "we passed a program to guarantee a college savings account for every single child who enters kindergarten in this county -- the first county in the United States to do so. The first one." PolitiFact Ohio was surprised by the statement, because we had looked previouslyat the College Savings Account Program. Advanced by FitzGeraldin November and approved by the County Council in April, the program will establish a $100 college-savings account for every new kindergarten student who lives in Cuyahoga County. We knew the program was similarto San Francisco's Kindergarten to College initiative -- and previous coverage indicated FitzGerald knew it. San Francisco's effort was developed with the Corporation for Enterprise Development, which said about a dozen other communities nationwide have set up savings account programs for children. We asked FitzGerald's campaign how he backed up the statement that Cuyahoga was "the first county in the United States to do so." They cited one of the Truth-O-Meter's guiding principles, that words matter. FitzGerald specifically said Cuyahoga County's program guarantees a college savings account "for every single child who enters kindergarten in this county." By "every single child," he meant that the program covers children entering kindergarten in public, private and parochial schools -- about 15,000 pupils a year. San Francisco's program, created in 2010, is similar but more restricted. It does not cover every child. The consolidated city-county program establishes a $50 savings account only for children entering kindergarten in public schools -- about 4,500 pupils a year. The Corporation for Enterprise Development, the Washington nonprofit that promotes saving and protecting assets and led the development of child savings programs, said no other program nationwide is on the scale established in Cuyahoga County. The county program is the nation's largest. FitzGerald said that the Cuyahoga County College Savings Account Program is the first county program in the nation "to guarantee a college savings account for every single child who enters kindergarten." The statement is accurate. Though additional information gives a fuller picture, it is not needed for accuracy, even in the context of a political speech. The statement was not misleading.

pomt-07022	A year since the "Recovery Summer," there has been been "a fall, winter and spring of no recovery."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2011/jul/05/rob-portman/sen-rob-portman-says-year-recovery-summer-theres-s/	Do you remember the Recovery Summer? Apparently, not many people do. It was a year ago, and President Barack Obama and the White House said that road-building and other construction projects in the second year of the $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (later estimated to cost $830 billion) would pump extra octane into the nation’s economic engine. Yet the economy, though certainly out of recession, is still struggling, creating a sense of uncertainty that has made Americans slow to build or buy houses and businesses reluctant to expand or spend money. It’s been "a year since we announced the summer of recovery," U.S. Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican, told Neil Cavuto of Fox Business Network on June 16. "And you’re right, it has been a fall, winter and spring of no recovery." Portman made the same claim during a news conference with Republican colleagues that day, saying, "Unfortunately, it wasn’t the summer of recovery. In fact, it wasn’t a fall, winter or spring of recovery." The mood of the nation sure seems to suggest that at times. But moods and metrics that measure the economy are two different things. Portman has major budget chops, having served as President George W. Bush’s trade ambassador and budget director, but there’s little downside to his party in suggesting that the Democratic administration has bungled the recovery. Fortunately, these things are measurable, so we went gathering metrics. Portman’s office suggested a comparison with the White House’s own projections of where the economy would stand by now with passage of the 2009 recovery act. The national unemployment rate was supposed to be below 7 percent by now, according to an incoming administration projection in January 2009. Instead, it’s at 9.1 percent. Total non-farm employment was supposed to be above 137.5 million by now, the same report projected. Instead, it’s 131 million, lower than when Obama took office. By that standard, said Portman spokeswoman Christine Mangi, "this could be called a 6.5 million jobs deficit." Those early job projections have been through the mill already. Advisers to Obama made them before he even took office. Call them overly optimistic or off-base; either way, they were wrong. Mangi added a few other measures that we confirmed. The average duration of unemployment is now 39.7 weeks, a recordsince the government began keeping records in 1948. These are persuasive numbers. Yet Portman spoke specifically of a summer, fall, winter and spring "of no recovery." He wasn’t referring to joblessness since Obama entered office. He was citing specific seasons since last summer. There are benchmarks for these seasons, so we examined them. Unemployment The seasonally adjusted national unemployment rate was 9.5 in June 2010, when the White House promoted the Recovery Summer. Then its movement resembled that of a yo-yo -- up, down, and back up again (9.1 percent at last count). In other words, the unemployment rate showed a recovery in one of the seasons but the trend has reversed. It is better now than at the start of the Recovery Summer, though that’s prompting few cheers. Number of Jobs By the start of the Recovery Summer, non-farm employment was at 129.9 million, down nearly 3 million from when the recovery act passed. The number of people working dropped by another 108,000 by the end of last summer. But by last November -- the Recovery Fall, if you will -- employment rose to 130.1 million, and was at 130.5 million by February. By May 2011, it climbed to 131 million. Keep in mind that these were private sector job gains, made impressive by the fact that they occurred as local and state governments were actually shedding workers, says Josh Bivens, an economist at the liberal Economic Policy Institute, a think tank that focuses on economic conditions of low- and middle-income Americans. While governments at all levels in this country lost 596,000 jobs since the start of the Recovery Summer, the private sector added 1.7 million jobs, according to figures we checked in Bureau of Labor Statistics databases. These are steady seasons of gains -- a trend that actually began in October 2010, the month of the Recovery Halloween -- although they’re insufficient to bring the economy out of its doldrums. At a recent press briefing, White House spokesman Jay Carney contrasted these gains with an economy that was "in free-fall" when Obama took office. "There was a loss of jobs at a pace of 700,000 a month," Carney said. We checked his numbers, too. They were solid. You might wonder why the rise in employment didn’t bring the jobless numbers down. It’s because job growth was insufficient to keep pace with the natural growth of the working age population. Growth of the U.S. Economy The gross domestic product, or GDP, is a measure of the country’s output of goods and services, and economists say it is a key number to watch. GDP growth has been sluggish many quarters, but it nevertheless has been positive since the middle of 2009, when the recession ended. It grew by 2.6 percent in the third quarter of 2010, a period that included much of the Recovery Summer, and by 3.1 percent in the fourth quarter, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Had growth continued at that rate, more job creation (and lower unemployment) might have followed. But economic growth slowed in the first quarter of 2011 to a meager 1.9 percent. As we researched this matter, sources mentioned other measures, among them stock market growth (up, though with stops and starts), corporate profits and CEO pay (up) and home prices (down -- and hovering close to where they were in 2003). Consumer confidence is still flagging. Republicans on the congressional Joint Economic Committee, using the pun "Barack Obama’s Recovery Bummer," say that a combination of indicators show that economic conditions today areworse than in any recovery since at least World War II. But their figures leave out the fact that the recession that began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009 was deeper than the prior ones. The bigger the hole, the tougher it is to dig out. If you compare job growth since this recession ended with job growth at this stage after the 2001 recession (one that lasted only 8 months), it is stronger today, says Bivens. So where does all this data leave us? Well, there’s actually more but we’ll spare you. You should know, however, that when the White House announced the Recovery Summer, it set out a goal: By the end of 2010, the recovery act would have created or saved at least 3.5 million jobs since its start. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office as well as Obama’s White House Council of Economic Advisers issued subsequent reports suggesting the goal was met, although their estimates had very wide ranges. That made us wonder if there was a more precise way to define "recovery." We checked with the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private, nonprofit research center whose work is watched closely by the government and universities. It turns out the national bureau doesn’t use that word. So we finally called James Feyrer, a Dartmouth College economist who conducted research for the national bureau on the question, "Did the stimulus stimulate?" (His short answer: "Yes. I think in the aggregate it did create positive stimulus for the economy." The longer answer is that some parts -- support for low-income households and infrastructure spending -- worked while grants to states for education did not appear to create additional jobs.) Asked about the no-recovery claim, he said, "I think the problem with that is that ‘recovery’ is in the eye of the beholder." The nation is out of recession, he said, "but we certainly are not having a robust recovery. It seems like we’re somewhere in the gap between where rhetoric and reality fall." Assessing Portman’s claim comes down to how you view the recovery -- not since the start of Obama’s presidency but since the start of the Recovery Summer, because that’s specifically what Portman was talking about. There have been successive seasons of GDP growth, though not consistently strong. The White House met its own standard, however imprecise it may have been (the goal of "saving" jobs is hard to measure). Private-sector job growth struck Bivens as noteworthy, especially when compared with the 2001 recession. But unemployment is still a big problem. Economists talk of an anemic recovery, but a recovery, nonetheless. Portman, on the other hand, said that "it wasn’t the summer of recovery," nor was it "a fall, winter or spring of recovery." That’s how he sees it, and it’s understandable that anyone without a job could see it that way too. But too many metrics present a different impression, showing there has been a recovery -- a weak one. It’s not all sunshine and rainbows, but it hasn’t been season after season of gloom, either. Portman’s statement contains some element of truth, but it ignores facts that would give a different impression. The Truth-O-Meter has a precise definition for such a claim: Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-10528	Says Clinton did not read the National Intelligence Estimate before voting for the Iraq war.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/mar/03/barack-obama/when-a-briefing-isnt-as-good-as-a-book/	Trying to counter Sen. Hillary Clinton's questions about his foreign policy chops, Sen. Barack Obama accused the New York senator of bungling the biggest foreign policy vote of her career by authorizing the use of military force against Iraq in 2002 without first reading the National Intelligence Estimate – a forecast by the nation's intelligence services of potential developments that could affect national security. To underscore his point, Obama noted that former Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., the chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence at the time, voted against the resolution, citing dissents in the document, primarily from the State and Energy departments, to intelligence reports that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction. "If you have a National Intelligence Estimate and the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee says, 'You should read this, this is why I'm voting against the war,' you should read it," Obama said in a speech in Westerville, Ohio, on March 1. Obama didn't serve in the Senate when the chamber cleared the use-of-force resolution, 77-23, on Oct. 11, 2002, but spoke against the war while serving as an Illinois state senator. To evaluate the vote on the resolution, one has to consider the ambivalence and fears about war that filled Congress at the time. With the memory of the Sept. 11 terror attacks fresh in everyone's mind, many lawmakers worried that the failure to give Bush the power to act against Iraq would make the United States more vulnerable to further attacks. Others were concerned they would be labeled unpatriotic if they voted against a popular president in the weeks before a national election. Many who had questioned Bush's talk of war wound up joining in a broad coalition behind the president. As a presidential candidate, Clinton has repeatedly said she made a mistake voting for the resolution but also noted that reading the entire National Intelligence Estimate was not a necessity because she and other lawmakers were getting frequent briefings from high-level Bush administration officials. The book Her Way: The Hopes and Ambitions of Hillary Rodham Clinton , by New York Times reporters Jeff Gerth and Don van Natta Jr., first suggested she did not read the report. "I was fully briefed by the people who wrote that. I was briefed by the people from, you know, the State Department, the CIA, the Department of Defense; all of the various players in that," Clinton said in a Jan. 13, 2008, appearance on Meet the Press. "Some people read it and voted for the resolution, some people read it and voted against the resolution. I felt very well briefed." Clinton sidestepped host Tim Russert's question about whether she read it, but she did not challenge his assertion that she had not. Instead, she emphasized that she spoke with the authors of the report. The back-and-forth is casting new attention on the National Intelligence Estimate, versions of which have been prepared since 1946, at the beginning of the Cold War with the Soviet Union. The documents are periodically requested by administration officials, military commanders or members of Congress and produced by the National Intelligence Council, which serves as the intelligence community's forecast center and reports directly to the director of National Intelligence. All of the nation's intelligence agencies have an opportunity to weigh in on the reports. Graham, in a 2005 op-ed piece in the Washington Post, said a careful reading of the National Intelligence Estimate revealed it didn't contain the rationale for a pre-emptive war in Iraq. Graham said he exercised the intelligence committee's prerogative during the run-up to the war and demanded that then-CIA Director George Tenet prepare a classified estimate in September 2002 after learning the White House had not requested one and that none was being prepared. The resulting 92-page document, in Graham's opinion, was slanted toward the conclusion that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction at 550 sites, but contained what he called "vigorous dissents," especially about aluminum tubes that were offered as evidence that Iraq was reconstituting its nuclear program. Clinton was far from the only member of Congress to rely on in-person briefings instead of actually reading the document. To read the report, members of Congress had to go to a secure location in the U.S. Capitol. The Washington Post reported in 2004 that no more than six senators and a handful of representatives had logged and read the report beyond a five-page executive summary. In the end, 29 out of 50 Democrats in the chamber voted in favor of the resolution, rejecting arguments by opponents led by Sen. Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia that it amounted to giving President Bush unlimited authority to wage war, akin to the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin resolution authorizing military action during the Vietnam War. We find Obama's accusation is accurate because Clinton said she relied on in-person briefings from the administration. We find Obama's statement to be True.

pomt-09825	"Since World War II, only Gerald Ford and Bill Clinton have had worse ratings after seven months than President Obama."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/31/newt-gingrich/barack-obama-poll-after-seven-months-shows-him-beh/	The pundits and prognosticators are saying President Barack Obama is losing his mojo. And they have facts to back up their claim. "Since World War II, only Gerald Ford and Bill Clinton have had worse ratings after seven months than President Obama," said Republican Newt Gingrich, offering advice to Obama on the op-ed page of the Washington Post. Gingrich's comment was part of a roundup of advice solicited by the Post for the supposedly faltering president; Gingrich advised Obama to reject his left-leaning supporters and move to the center. Being but humble fact-checkers, we can't speak to the wisdom or folly of Gingrich's advice. But we certainly can check his factual statement about Obama's poll numbers, a claim we've seen repeated in other media. The Gallup poll actually has been tracking presidential approval ratings since World War II. We consulted Gallup's tracking polls and found that Gingrich is correct. At the seven-month mark, Obama's approval rating was 51 percent. The only two presidents doing worse than Obama were Gerald Ford and Bill Clinton. Interestingly, Ford and Clinton finished their presidencies with decidely different outcomes. Ford's public approval ratings dropped below 50 percent about three months into his presidency. Those numbers improved slightly and plateaued over the next few years. But Ford, who took office upon Richard Nixon's resignation in 1974, lost the 1976 election to Jimmy Carter. Clinton's approval ratings dropped below 50 percent four months into his presidency, falling even further during his first year in office to the high 30s. There were a few more ups and downs during his first term, but he won re-election in 1996 and finished his term in 2001 with approval ratings above 60 percent, despite being impeached by the House of Representatives after a sex scandal. Make of all this what you will. We've looked into Gingrich's statement and found that he is correct. We rate his statement True.

pomt-10238	In the U.S. Senate, Barack Obama "has not reached across party lines to get anything significant done."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/02/joe-lieberman/we-found-a-few-things/	In a major speech to the Republican National Convention, Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut praised his friend John McCain and attacked the Democratic nominee Barack Obama. Lieberman was a Democrat who lost his primary race in 2006. He ran as an Independent Democrat in the general election and won his fourth senate term. Lieberman praised McCain on Sept. 2, 2008, at the convention in St. Paul, Minn., as an independent thinker who puts his country first. Obama, Lieberman said, is too inexperienced to be effective. "Sen. Obama is a gifted and eloquent young man who can do great things for our country in the years ahead," he said. "But eloquence is no substitute for a record — not in these tough times. In the Senate he has not reached across party lines to get anything significant done, nor has he been willing to take on powerful interest groups in the Democratic Party." Here we'll look at the statement that Obama has not reached across party lines to get anything significant done. But we've found several instances of legislation that Obama passed in concert with Republican lawmakers. • Obama collaborated with Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., in 2006 to pass a law (PL 109-282) creating a Google-like database of federal contracts and grants allowing users to type in key words that would bring up exactly how much money any particular recipient received. • With then-Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Richard G. Lugar, R-Ind., Obama won enactment of a 2006 law (PL 109-401) that allowed the United States to export nuclear fuel, technology and reactors to India for the first time in three decades. The law accepted India as a nuclear-armed power and was enacted despite concerns about India's ties to Iran and past sanctions for transferring sensitive equipment to Iran. • He also worked with Lugar on a Senate bill that authorized the president to carry out a program to provide assistance to foreign countries to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Another part of the measure was intended to stop the spread of conventional weapons, notably shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles that the legislation refers to as man-portable air defense systems, or MANPADS. The bill's provisions were incorporated into a House bill that passed later that year and was signed into law in January 2007 (PL 109-472). These bills arguably meet the threshhold of significance, particularly the two measures with Lugar on important foreign policy issues. Since Obama is a Democrat, and Lugar and Coburn are Republicans, that seems to qualify as reaching across party lines. We find Lieberman's claim False.

pomt-14826	"I watched in Jersey City, N.J., where thousands and thousands of people were cheering" as the World Trade Center collapsed.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/22/donald-trump/fact-checking-trumps-claim-thousands-new-jersey-ch/	Arguing that there are terrorist sympathizers in the United States, Donald Trump says he saw "thousands" of New Jerseyans celebrating after the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. "I watched when the World Trade Center came tumbling down," the Republican presidential candidate said at a Nov. 21 rally in Birmingham, Ala. "And I watched in Jersey City, N.J., where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down. Thousands of people were cheering." The next day, ABC This Week host George Stephanopoulos asked Trump if he misspoke, noting that "the police say that didn't happen." Trump -- who has said he was in his Manhattan apartment the morning of the attack -- doubled down. "It was on television. I saw it," Trump said. "It was well covered at the time, George. Now, I know they don't like to talk about it, but it was well covered at the time. There were people over in New Jersey that were watching it, a heavy Arab population, that were cheering as the buildings came down. Not good." We looked back at the record to see what we could find about American Muslim celebrations in New Jersey on 9/11. While we found widely broadcast video of people in the Palestinian territories celebrating, we found no evidence to back up Trump’s description of events on American soil. Urban myth We conducted an exhaustive search of newspaper and television transcripts on LexisNexis, looking for reports from September 2001 through December 2001 that made any mention of Muslims in New Jersey celebrating the 9/11 attacks. Regarding Jersey City, which Trump mentioned specifically, we found two uncorroborated and unsourced mentions. Neither begins to approach the scale Trump described. The Associated Press, on Sept. 17, 2001, described "rumors of rooftop celebrations of the attack by Muslims" in Jersey City. But the same report said those rumors were "unfounded." The Washington Post, on Sept. 18, 2001, published an article that claimed "law enforcement authorities detained and questioned a number of people who were allegedly seen celebrating the attacks and holding tailgate-style parties on rooftops while they watched the devastation on the other side of the river." The Post story includes no source for this information, and we found no evidence that any of these allegations ever stuck. A more rampant rumor of Muslim or Arab-Americans cheering the attacks centered around nearby Paterson, N.J. But that turned out to be just a rumor, spawned by chain emails and perpetuated by shock jock Howard Stern’s radio show. The Star-Ledger reported that as the rumors spread, "Paterson police rushed to South Main Street, the center of the city's Middle Eastern community." "When we got there, they were all in prayer," Paterson Police Chief Lawrence Spagnola said. Three percent of New Jersey residents are Muslim -- the highest of any state -- according to Pew Research Center. Suspected 9/11 terrorists had ties to Jersey City and Paterson. But there is no conclusive evidence that any New Jersey residents celebrated the attacks, and there is no evidence whatsoever of any demonstrations where "thousands and thousands of people" cheered. Nor is there any evidence Trump saw these events play out in any way, be it on TV or in person. We reached out to Trump’s campaign but didn’t hear back. What we did find are many stories of Muslims living in New Jersey speaking out against the attacks and bracing themselves for anti-Muslim backlash. For example, Paterson residents put up a banner on the city’s main street that said "The Muslim Community Does Not Support Terrorism.'' Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop responded to Trump’s statement on Twitter, saying Trump "has memory issues or willfully distorts the truth." Our ruling Trump said he "watched in Jersey City, N.J., where thousands and thousands of people were cheering" as the World Trade Center collapsed. This defies basic logic. If thousands and thousands of people were celebrating the 9/11 attacks on American soil, many people beyond Trump would remember it. And in the 21st century, there would be video or visual evidence. Instead, all we found were a couple of news articles that described rumors of celebrations that were either debunked or unproven. Trump’s recollection of events in New Jersey in the hours after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks flies in the face of all the evidence we could find. We rate this statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-08657	DeWine "took $1.9 million from big banks," "supported legislation that helped Bernie Madoff make millions" and "protected predatory lenders while families lost their homes."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2010/sep/14/ohio-democratic-party/ohio-democratic-partys-charge-dewine-was-wall-stre/	The Democratic political playbook has a new page that is getting flipped to the most in 2010—running against Wall Street. Whenever possible this year Democratic candidates are linking their Republican opponents to one of the primary bogeymen for the country’s economic recession. The Ohio Democratic Party uses this tactic in a web ad focused on former U.S. Sen. Mike DeWine, the Republican candidate for Ohio attorney general, even going so far as to call him a "lap dog" for Wall Street. The ODP attack rolls everything bad about Wall Street into one big ball evoking big banks, Wall Street villain and convicted swindler Bernie Madoff and predatory lenders. The video says that while in Congress, DeWine "took $1.9 million from big banks. DeWine supported legislation that helped Bernie Madoff make millions. He protected predatory lenders while families lost their homes." PolitiFact Ohio decided to dig into these claims that paint DeWine as a pawn of the Wall Street elite. The most straightforward one is that DeWine took $1.9 million from "big banks." ODP officials say it’s easy to get $1.9 million. Just add up DeWine’s career fundraising totals on Open secrets.org — the handy federal fundraising tracker from the independent Center for Responsive Politics — as well as more than $62,000 raised in the current AG’s race. While the math checks out, you can get to the $1.9 million figure only by adding in money not only from commercial banks ($595,677) but also securities and investment firms ($726,375), miscellaneous financial institutions ($348,548) as well as finance and credit card companies ($237,750). The "big bank" claim need a pretty big tent to fit all of the qualifying financial institutions in its shade. Meanwhile, the ODP claim that DeWine "helped Madoff make millions" can be traced to three "yes" votes the Republican cast in 1995 for a bill known as the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. DeWine joined 48 Republicans and 20 Democrats in the Senate. The legislation raised the burden of proof lawyers in private practice would have to show in cases of corporate fraud. That means that DeWine’s vote was "helping Madoff make millions" because it handcuffed private attorneys from pursuing claims as concerns surfaced "as early as 1999" that Madoff was operating a Ponzi scheme, the ODP argues in an e-mail. Even if that’s true — and it’s certainly open to debate — the timing of the concerns about Madoff’s operation don’t square with the timeline as presented by the Ohio Democratic Party. In a 477-page report issued in 2009, SEC Inspector General David Kotz found that substantive complaints against Madoff were filed as far back as 1992 — three years before DeWine voted to overhaul the law. That reports states that a total of "three examinations and two investigations" were conducted by SEC officials but that "a thorough and competent investigation or examination was never performed." Most incredibly, SEC officials even failed to take the most basic of steps to check up on Madoff. "At no time did the SEC ever verify Madoff’s trading through an independent third-party, and in fact, never actually conducted a Ponzi scheme examination or investigation of Madoff," states Kotz’s report. Madoff himself called it "astonishing" that the check wasn’t done. "They never even looked at my stock records," he told Kotz for his report, according to a December 2009 story in the New York Daily News. "It would have been easy for them to see. If you’re looking at a Ponzi scheme, it’s the first thing you do." Clearly, the overriding reason that Madoff went undetected for so long is because the federal officials supposed to watch over him dropped the ball again and again. Is it possible that a private attorney could have brought forward an investigation that brought Madoff to justice if the law hadn’t been changed in 1995? Yes, it is possible, but it’s far from a sure thing, especially considering that the old law was in place for three years after initial concerns surfaced about Madoff. Besides, the law change doesn’t seem to quite equal "helping make Madoff money," even if you conclude he would have been caught earlier if the old law had been in place. Lastly, the ODP accuses DeWine of helping "to protect predatory lenders while families lost their homes." That charge references a pair of 2001 tabling votes that DeWine made during the debate over the Bankruptcy Reform Act, which never became law because the differences between the House and Senate versions were never reconciled. At that time, DeWine, 48 other Republicans and 15 Democrats blocked an amendment requiring that credit card companies disclose more information to consumers and giving stiffer penalties for predatory lenders. The other amendment that DeWine tried unsuccessfully to table prevented predatory lenders who violated the Truth in Lending Act from filing for bankruptcy to dodge claims. Those votes were at a time when the Ohio Democratic Party says "families lost their homes" in a reference to the foreclosure crisis that has walloped the state, including a record-high 89,053 foreclosure cases in 2009. However, Ohio Supreme Court statistics on foreclosures show only 43,419 in 2001. So while certainly some families were among those who lost their homes in 2001, the foreclosure numbers were about half the record-breaking foreclosure numbers that have hit the state in recent years with upwards of 80,000 a year since 2007. By then, DeWine wasn’t even a senator. Add it up, and the scorecard for the Ohio Democratic Party is far from spotless. The $1.9 million figure isn’t wholly accurate because it lumps in a broad range of financial service companies into "big banks." The Bernie Madoff charge lays the blame for his long-term swindling on a law change, rather than on the on bumbling investigators where it properly belongs. And the protecting predatory lending charge implies that DeWine’s votes came recently during the worst of Ohio’s foreclosure crisis when they really were made more than nine years ago. We rate the Ohio Democratic Party’s claims as Barely True. Comment on this item. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Ohio Democratic Party	None	None	None	2010-09-14T10:10:00	2010-08-23	['Bernard_Madoff']
pomt-08629	After Hurricane Katrina, "Dallas and San Antonio took in 5,000 to 10,000 refugees each, but (Bill) White brought in 250,000 and put them up in his 'buddies' empty apartment buildings and let the federal government pay their rents for over two years. They did not return to New Orleans, most of them are on welfare."	false	/texas/statements/2010/sep/19/chain-email/chain-e-mail-claims-bill-white-let-federal-governm/	Democratic gubernatorial candidate Bill White received national praise for welcoming Hurricane Katrina evacuees to Houston as the city's mayor, after the violent storm displaced hundreds of thousands of New Orleans residents in 2005. But a chain e-mail a reader forwarded us on July 25 and that we also saw posted on Internet message boards casts White's response to the disaster as a negative. "In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina a few years ago, Dallas and San Antonio took in 5-10 thousand refugees each, but White brought in 250,000 and put them up in his 'buddies' empty apartment buildings and let the federal government pay their rents for over two years," the e-mail states. "They did not return to New Orleans, most of them are on welfare." Anonymous chain e-mails are notorious for missing facts. For instance, the e-mail we're reviewing also says "White turned Houston into the biggest sanctuary city east of Los Angeles by refusing to let the Houston Police or ICE ask a criminal or even a suspect if they were in this country legally." In March, we rated False a claim that as mayor, White offered sanctuary to illegal immigrants. So we wondered about White's record following the Katrina hegira. Let's start with how many evacuees that each city mentioned in the chain e-mail took in. Dallas: Frank Librio, a city spokesman, told us the Dallas-Fort Worth area took in about 20,000 refugees, while the city alone absorbed approximately 3,000. That number doesn't include those who stayed with families or in hotels on their own, said Librio, who estimated several thousand more took refuge in Dallas. San Antonio: James Mendoza, assistant emergency management coordinator for San Antonio's Office of Emergency Management, told us via a spokeswoman that an estimated 25,000 to 35,000 evacuees stayed there. Houston: The City of Houston didn't respond to our queries, but news reports from the months following the hurricane say that between 100,000 and 150,000 evacuees took shelter in Houston. A September 2006 report by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security states that "over 400,000 Hurricane Katrina evacuees initially sought refuge in Texas and up to 150,000 arrived in the Houston area seeking food, shelter and medical care." In August 2006, NPR reported that more than 111,000 evacuees from New Orleans were still in Houston, with 250,000 living in all of Texas. Upshot: The chain e-mail is about 100,000 off in its estimate of how many evacuees White welcomed to Houston, and at least 15,000 off in its San Antonio estimate. It's in the ballpark for how many evacuees stayed in the city of Dallas. Next, we looked at whether White funneled evacuees to his "buddies'" empty apartment buildings while the government paid the rent. According to a December 2005 Houston Chronicle article, "White worked out an unprecedented plan in concert with FEMA officials: Any family affected by the storm could receive a voucher from the city good for 12 months of rent and utilities at decent but not extravagant apartments that participated in the program. The city paid the landlords directly, and then received reimbursement from FEMA." Katy Bacon, a spokeswoman for White's campaign, told us via e-mail that White "called on local hotel owners and apartment complex owners for their assistance in housing the hundreds of thousands of evacuees." Jeff Hall, executive vice president of the Houston Apartment Association, told us that in response to White's administration, 250 association members — apartment owners and managers — attended an emergency meeting at Houston's city hall on Sept. 6, 2005, eight days after the storm made landfall, that resulted in 201 owners and companies signing letters of intent to set aside more than 10,000 rental units for evacuees. "In the end, more than 37,000 units were rented," he said. Hall said that apartment buildings were not vacant, as the chain e-mail says. Nor was the emergency housing program a windfall for apartment owners, he said. "Many were paid rents below market value," he said. "In many cases, payments for rent were delayed for months, causing financial concerns for owners." Hall said the effort was originally funded through the city, then through FEMA, and then by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) through local housing authorities. "Though some evacuees have returned to their pre-hurricane hometowns, many continue to reside in Houston," Hall said. Michael Gerber, executive director of the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs, told us his department worked closely with the city, White, Harris County Judge Robert Eckels and the apartment association, among others, to "identify vacant units" for evacuees so that families wouldn't be stuck in the AstroDome. Gerber said it was "all hands on deck." He said he didn't witness any impropriety involving White. Donald Sampley, who served as White's assistant director of Housing and Community Development starting in 2006, said White never interfered with the local housing authorities. He "never directed me, or to my knowledge, my boss, about who would receive money and who wouldn't receive money," Sampley said. As for whether White "let" the federal government pay rent on evacuees' apartments, FEMA spokesman Earl Armstrong told us that city mayors had no say in whether or not hurricane evacuees could receive federal aid. Donna White, a HUD spokesman, told us that 5,300 families received help paying their rent through a disaster assistance program that picked up where FEMA aid left off in November 2007. The program ended in October 2009. Nationally, 37,000 families were enrolled in the disaster housing program, and 12,000 eventually transitioned into HUD's non-emergeny housing assistance program. What about the chain e-mail's lament that Katrina evacuees never returned to New Orleans and that "most of them are on welfare?" According to a 2006 study by the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, 111,111 evacuees were still living in Houston as of May 2006 and 251,000 were still living in Texas. The study found that most families displaced to Texas didn't have firm plans to leave — 40 percent of all evacuees believed they'd still be in Texas two years later (in 2008), while 22 percent didn't know where they'd be. Some 35 percent of evacuees living in Houston thought they'd still be there in two years, and 21 percent didn't know where they'd be. Finally, we tried to weigh what the chain e-mail means by "welfare," a that term hasn't had a clear-cut definition since Congress overhauled the benefits offered to low-income Americans in the 1990s. Stephanie Goodman, a spokeswoman a HHSC, told us that the state doesn't use that term. Anne Dunkelberg, associate director at the liberal-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities (CPPP), told us the center assumes people are talking about Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), which provides cash to families in dire need. According to the HHSC's 2006 study, 5 percent of Hurricane Katrina evacuees were receiving TANF benefits. As of the end of July 2010, 111,920 Texans, including 7,929 Harris County residents, were receiving TANF benefits — $167 per month on average — according to HHSC. More than three million Texans receive food stamps and Medicaid, which some people see as a form of welfare, according to Celia Hagert, a policy analyst at CPPP. According to the HHSC's 2006 study of Katrina evacuees, 33 percent of all respondents said someone in their family received Medicaid and 11 percent said someone in their family received health care through the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). In Houston, those numbers were 32 percent and 10 percent, respectively. Also in Houston, 36 percent of evacuees received food stamps. Bottom line? The chain e-mail's count of evacuees who settled in Dallas is about right, but it understates the evacuees who landed in San Antonio and overstates by 100,000, or 67 percent, the evacuees who took up residence in Houston. It's true that evacuees could get assistance to pay for housing for more than two years, as the e-mail says, but the 2006 state study found that more than half of surveyed evacuees did not expect to stay in Texas — meaning, it seems to us, that an undetermined share might have planned to return to New Orleans, contrary to the chain e-mail's claim that no one has returned. We are hampered here by a lack of research. The state study also found that the share of evacuees who said they were benefiting from cash assistance, what we're assuming the chain e-mail scribe means by welfare, was only 5 percent. Significantly, we found no evidence to support the e-mail's claim that White put up evacuees in apartments owned by his pals. So some details of the e-mail are right, but its most explosive — and damaging — claims aren't backed up by facts. We rate the e-mail False. This story was updated to correct the number of Texans receiving TANF benefits to 111,920, including 7,929 Harris County residents.

pomt-15308	"The actual deportations from the interior of the country are way down" under President Obama.	true	/virginia/statements/2015/jul/20/bob-goodlatte/goodlatte-says-deportations-us-interior-have-falle/	Rep. Bob Goodlatte scoffs at any suggestion that President Barack Obama has been tough on immigration. Amid news that a 32-year-old woman was allegedly murdered by a felon who had been deported repeatedly, Goodlatte said Obama has been soft on enforcing the country’s immigration laws. "The actual deportations from the interior of the country are way down (under Obama)," Goodlatte, R-6th, said in an interview on ABC News. Are deportations from the interior "way down" under Obama? We asked Goodlatte, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, for the source of his statement. We heard back from Jessica Collins, the deputy communication director for the House Judiciary Committee. She pointed us to a 2014 memo that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement sent to the committee in response to questions about the federal agency’s figures on undocumented immigrants expelled from the U.S. The agency’s figures show that in 2008, the year before Obama took office, there were 244,091 removals of illegal immigrants from the interior of the U.S., which the agency defines as anywhere away from the "immediate border" where an immigrant is barred from trying to enter the country illegally. In 2009, there were 237,941 interior removals in the first year of Obama’s term. That dropped to 133,551 by year 2013. Those figures represent a broad group of deportations which include two main categories. One is "removals," where someone is ordered out of the country by a formal court order and prohibited from coming back for a period of time. The other category is "returns," where an immigrant voluntarily leaves the U.S., often in the absence of a formal order. That situation typically doesn’t carry harsh penalties if they return to the country. The immigration agency further broke down its figures for the House panel, excluding simple returns and focusing on formal removals. In 2008, there were 171,540 of those removals from the interior. That rose to 175,702 in Obama’s first year in office in 2009 before falling to 110,781 in 2013. In 2014, ICE said it conducted 102,224 removals. It’s not immediately clear from ICE’s latest report whether that 2014 figure includes only formal removals mandated by an order, or whether it includes removals and returns. But either way you look at the figures, interior deportations have fallen between 40 and 60 percent during Obama’s term. Four immigration policy analysts we talked to agreed that interior deportations dropped off under Obama. Marc Rosenblum, the deputy director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute, said those deportations really dropped off in recent years as a result of the Obama shifting enforcement away from immigrants who didn’t fall into certain groups flagged for high priority for deportation. The White House is focused on people apprehended at the border and on other priority targets such as immigrants charged with a various crimes or deemed to be a threat to public safety, Rosenblum said. "While they’ve been scaling back interior removals, they’ve been increasing border removals," Rosenblum told us. A July report by the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington think tank founded by a group of Democratic and Republican senators, illustrated that switch. In 2008, about two-thirds of ICE’s 369,000 removals were from the interior, while the other third were from the border. That proportion started to change a couple of years ago and by 2014, about one-third of the agency’s 316,000 removals were from the interior while the other two-thirds were from the border. Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, wrote in a January blog post, that while interior removals have fallen in recent years under Obama, they remain high compared to former President George W. Bush. Looking at the last six years of the former president’s tenure, Nowrasteh said there were an average of 79,000 removed from the interior annually under Bush, compared with an average of 158,000 during the first six years of Obama’s term. But one problem in comparing the two administrations, Nowrasteh noted, is that there were a chunk of cases each year under Bush in which it was unclear from where in the U.S. an immigrant had been deported. Our ruling Goodlatte said deportations are "way down" under Obama. The figures he cites show a significant drop during Obama’s term, a trend confirmed by several by immigration analysts we interviewed. We rate his statement True.

pomt-06766	On abortion.	full flop	/texas/statements/2011/aug/21/susan-combs/did-comptroller-susan-combs-flip-flop-abortion/	Three years before the next Texas lieutenant governor’s election, one possible Republican candidate, Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples, accused another, Comptroller Susan Combs, of changing her position on abortion. In an Aug. 2 letter to Combs seeking clarification of her stance, Staples says recent comments by Combs’ spokesman run "completely contrary" to her "known pro-choice position." Recent comments? Cody McGregor, campaign manager for Staples, pointed us to a July 5 column in the Houston Chronicle that quotes Combs’ political consultant Reggie Bashur as saying that Combs "wants Roe v. Wade overturned" and is against abortion except in cases of rape, incest or when a woman’s life is in jeopardy. Has Combs flip-flopped on abortion? Some background: Combs, Staples and others who may vie for lieutenant governor in 2014 are drawing attention now because the incumbent, David Dewhurst, recently joined the 2012 field of candidates for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Kay Bailey Hutchison. That means Dewhurst hopes he won’t be seeking another term as lieutenant governor two years later. Staples has said that he will compete for the post overseeing the Texas Senate as long as Dewhurst doesn’t. And Combs is considering jumping in, according to Bashur. Combs, in her second term as comptroller, previously served as state agriculture commissioner and in the Texas House, where she represented an Austin-area district. We first looked into Combs’ past position on abortion. In his letter, Staples says Combs’ "pro-choice position is well documented" through "quoted comments in several news reports." Reporter Peggy Fikac’s July 5 Chronicle column cites two earlier news articles. The first is a May 1995 Austin American-Statesman story in which Combs, then a House member, discussed her belief that government had grown too large and powerful. "We are so casual about government intrusion in our lives," Combs is quoted as saying. "I'm pro-choice for the same reason.'' The second news article cited in the Chronicle column was an Associated Press story from November 2003, when Combs was agriculture commissioner. "Combs supports a woman's right to choose, with exceptions," the story says. "She opposes ‘partial-birth’ abortions and third-trimester abortions and favors parental notification for minors seeking abortions." In an interview, Brooke Botello, communications director for the comptroller's office, told us that the AP story accurately covered Combs' earlier position on abortion. Botello also told us that Combs' position had not shifted significantly during her years as a House member and agriculture commissioner. Staples’ campaign also sent us a February 2011 Texas Tribune story that kicks off by asking whether it’s possible for a pro-choice candidate to win a "high-profile" statewide Republican primary in Texas. "Susan Combs might try," it says. The article describes Combs’ position as "anti-abortion but pro-choice" and says that Combs "has said Roe v. Wade should stand." That Supreme Court ruling, issued Jan. 22, 1973, struck down a Texas law prohibiting nearly all abortions and said states could not prohibit a woman from having an abortion before viability, the time at which a fetus can survive outside a woman's body. It noted that viability "is usually placed at about seven months (28 weeks)" of pregnancy "but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks." After fetal viability, the court said, states could limit abortions provided that their policies met certain requirements, including an exception to protect the life of the woman. Since then, other Supreme Court rulings have affirmed states' rights to impose further restrictions. The first sign we found of a possible shift by Combs was in a May 22 Houston Chronicle article on the 2011 regular legislative session. It reported that at Combs’ request, state Rep. Jim Landtroop, R-Plainview, added an amendment to a budget-related bill that would have prohibited businesses from claiming money spent on elective abortions through its employee health plans as an exemption from the state’s franchise tax. When calculating how much they owe under the tax, qualifying companies are permitted to deduct from total revenue certain costs, including health care benefits. The article quotes Rep. John Otto, R-Dayton, as saying that Combs sought the change "to remove what she would consider public subsidies of insurance policies covering abortions. ... In her view, that is subsidizing abortion because that is public money." Botello confirmed that Combs had asked Landtroop to propose the amendment. The overall proposal died, though, and the Combs-backed amendment did not become law. About six weeks later, in July, Bashur’s statement that Combs is now against most abortions appeared in the Chronicle column. On Aug. 2, Staples shared his letter to Combs with news organizations, and the next day, Combs was interviewed by the Tribune, which reported that she had "switched her position on abortion rights, from pro-choice to pro-life." In the interview, Tribune reporter Ross Ramsey says: "Let’s talk about choice. I understand that your position on this has changed." Combs replies: "Uh huh." She continues: "Twenty years ago, I was pro-choice … because I had concerns about the role of government." She then says that she changed her mind after "looking at studies and data and reading books" and concluding that abortion is being used as "birth control." "It is stunning to me that we are at the point in this country where in 2011, you have incredibly high numbers of women choosing to abort rather than have a baby or to have avoided the problem in the first place," she told the Tribune. "So I am unequivocal about it. I was wrong, and it's 20 years later, and I feel very strongly about it." Combs’ newly articulated position — in favor of overturning Roe v. Wade and against abortion except in cases of rape, incest or when a woman’s life is threatened — mirrors Staples’. And Austin consultant Wayne Hamilton, a former executive director of the Republican Party of Texas, told us that Texas candidates have generally been considered pro-life if they oppose abortion except in those three cases, though some candidates rule out exceptions. So, how does Combs’ acknowledged shift rate on the Flip-O-Meter? Previously, Combs was in favor of allowing abortions in most cases, excluding those in the final trimester of pregnancy. Now, she opposes abortion in most cases, with the exception of those involving rape, incest or when a woman’s life is threatened. Full Flop.

pomt-14384	"Republicans control the U.S. Senate with 54 seats, but those 54 senators were elected by only two-thirds the number of voters who elected the Democrats. In the Senate, the majority party represents a minority of the people."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2016/mar/17/roy-zimmerman/singer-roy-zimmermans-measure-public-support-senat/	Progressive activist-songwriter Roy Zimmerman took a musical jab at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell amid the debate over whether Senate Republicans should consider President Barack Obama's nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court. The issue is McConnell's position, coming about an hour after Justice Antonin Scalia’s death had been confirmed, that the vacancy should not be filled until the election of a new president. Zimmerman, best known for singing about obsessive liberals and the hypnotic arguments of Republicans, contends in the song "65 Million" that far more people voted for the Democrats in the Senate than voted for Republicans. "Republicans control the U.S. Senate with 54 seats, but those 54 senators were elected by only two-thirds the number of voters who elected the Democrats,' he says between verses. 'In the Senate, the majority party represents a minority of the people." We wondered if Zimmerman's two points were in tune with the facts, specifically whether his numbers were correct and whether Republican senators represent a minority of the people. When we emailed his website, his wife and co-writer, Melanie Harby, immediately sent along the most recent vote totals for all the senators culled from Wikipedia. The two-thirds ratio First, we checked the Wikipedia totals against the elections database Ballotpedia.org. The Wikipedia vote tallies were different in nearly one-third of the races — in one contest the discrepancy was 71,936 votes. So we turned to a third source, the post-election reports of the Clerk of the House of Representatives. Using the federal numbers as the standard, Wikipedia reported different vote totals in 31 of 100 races. Ballotpedia had discrepancies in nine of 100 races. When we used the official numbers to determine the ratio, it wasn't exactly two-thirds, but it was very close to what Zimmerman said. Congress' 54 GOP senators were elected with 47,068,532 votes. The rest of the senators collectively received 67,933,645. That means Republicans got just 69 percent of the votes garnered by all of the other senators, or just over the two-thirds that Zimmerman talked about. However, two of the non-Republicans are independents. Because they caucus with the Democrats, Harby said, it's fair to include them. That's debatable. Nonetheless, if you exclude them, the Democrats accumulated 67,355,217 votes. Put another way, Republicans earned 70 percent of the votes earned by Democrats. (The percentage only increases slightly because the independents come from states with relatively small populations — Maine and Vermont.) Why would a majority of the senators be elected by a minority of the United States population? The founding fathers allowed for that when they decided that every state — with populations large and small — would only elect two senators. So there's nothing extraordinary about having a group of senators (in this case, the Democrats) who are in the minority even though they were elected by the most votes because they won seats in large states such as California and New York. Voters vs. 'the people' But Zimmerman strikes a sour note in the second half of his statement where he says, "In the Senate, the majority party represents a minority of the people." There are several reasons this is off-key. First, the Democratic victors may have garnered 20 million more votes than the Republicans who won, but that doesn't represent 20 million more voters. Remember, every voter gets to pick two senators for their state. In this case, one vote doesn't equal one voter. Second, the numbers can be skewed by the size of the population in each state. A Democrat who wins 51 percent of the vote in California (population: 39 million) can rack up a disproportionate number of votes compared to a Republican from Wyoming (population: under 600,000) who wins 95 percent of the vote. Third, the typical winning candidates in the 2012 Senate election probably got a lot more votes than the winning candidates running in 2010 or 2014 because 2012 was a presidential election year, when turnout is significantly higher. Only 58.2 percent of eligible voters voted in the 2012 presidential contest, 41 percent in 2010 and 35.9 percent in 2014. Historically, a higher turnout tends to favor the Democrats. Finally, it's problematic to suggest, as Zimmerman does, that the person who won the majority of the votes represents the majority of the people. Some candidates win with less than half the vote, which can happen in races with more that two candidates. Candidates in uncontested races may lose out because many voters don't bother to vote in those races. Candidates who get more than half the vote may not represent the majority of the people. As we alluded to above, even in the best years, more than one-third of the people eligible to vote don't go to the polls. The nation hasn't seen a turnout higher than 66.7 percent since the 1900 presidential election. The national turnout for a midterm election hasn't been above 50 percent since 1914, according to the United States Election Project. In the 2014 midterm election, it was just 36 percent. Our ruling Zimmerman said, "Republicans control the U.S. Senate with 54 seats, but those 54 senators were elected by only two-thirds the number of voters who elected the Democrats. In the Senate, the majority party represents a minority of the people." He's very close on the numbers, but he adds a sour note when he tries to equate the vote totals for the current members of the Senate to the general population. Because the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important context, we rate it Half True.

pomt-05066	States still face a "mandate" to expand Medicaid coverage under President Obama's health care reform law.	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2012/jul/06/bob-mcdonnell/bob-mcdonnell-says-supreme-court-ruling-health-car/	Gov. Bob McDonnell joined the list of disappointed Republican leaders who took to airwaves in the hours after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld most of President Obama’s health care law. McDonnell, the chairman of the Republican Governors Association, said the court’s ruling does not mean the law is good policy. Then he ripped at a provision that will greatly widen the Medicaid program for low-income and disabled people. McDonnell said the expansion will strain state budgets. "I tell you what it means for Virginia -- $2.2 billion of an unfunded mandate in Medicaid expansion over the next decade," McDonnell said in an interview on MSNBC on June 28, the day the Supreme Court issued its ruling. McDonnell repeated his statement on June 29 -- the day after the court decision -- during a CNN interview with Soledad O’Brien. He said as a result of the ruling, a "$2.2 billion unfunded mandate falls on Virginia." "Medicaid is growing incredibly fast as a part of the budget. Now this is $2.2 billion on Virginia," the governor said. Late in the afternoon of June 29, McDonnell appeared on Fox News and referred to the health care law as "a cumbersome, unfunded mandate that will cost my state $2.2 billion in the next 10 years by this incredible expansion of Medicaid that has already busted the budget." McDonnell’s mandate claims are striking because, even at the time of his first utterance, it was being widely reported that the court ruling overturned a provision in the law that required states to expand Medicaid. We initially thought the governor misspoke. But when McDonnell twice repeated his statement on national television the next day, we decided to examine his claim that the health care law still subjects states to a Medicaid mandate. The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 ruling, upheld the major provision of the health care law that will require most people to buy medical insurance or pay a tax penalty. The law also calls for expanding Medicaid by covering adults and families with incomes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, starting in 2014. The court struck down a provision that allowed the federal government to revoke its matching Medicaid funds to a state that refused to take part in the expansion. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote on page 58 of the ruling: "As for the Medicaid expansion, that portion of the Affordable Care Act violates the Constitution by threatening existing Medicaid funding. Congress has no authority to order the states to regulate according to its instructions. Congress may offer the states grants and require the states to comply with accompanying conditions, but the states must have a genuine choice whether to accept the offer." Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, in a written statement released several hours after the Supreme Court decision, concluded that the Medicaid mandate had been voided. He called it a "silver lining" in a disappointing ruling. "The court blocked the federal government from withholding Medicaid dollars that states receive under the current Medicaid program if those states do not want to participate in the new and costly program expansions mandated under the health care law," Cuccinelli wrote. "This alone could save the commonwealth about $200 million a year..." Timothy S. Jost, a law professor at Washington & Lee University, had a similar take during an interview the day after the high court ruling. "The Supreme Court expressly said if Virginia doesn’t want to participate in the Medicaid expansion, it does not have to," Jost told us. We asked the governor’s office how McDonnell justified his claim that the ruling means a $2.2 billion mandate for Virginia. Jeff Caldwell, a McDonnell spokesman, cited a 2010 report by the Virginia House Appropriations Committee staff estimating it would cost the state between $1.5 billion and $2.2 billion to cover Medicaid expansion through fiscal 2022. "As you know, the Supreme Court’s ruling places some uncertainty in this issue by removing the mandate" for Medicaid, Caldwell said in an email. In other words, the administration is acknowledging that -- contrary to McDonnell’s statements -- the Medicaid mandate is void. One final note: The federal government will pay for the vast bulk of the expansion costs for states, covering 100 percent of the tab from the 2014 through 2016 fiscal years. Starting in 2017, the federal share gradually goes down to 90 percent by the 2021 fiscal year. That’s still a better deal than the 50 percent federal Medicaid match now offered to Virginia. Our ruling After the Supreme Court’s ruling on the health care act, McDonnell repeatedly said states still face a "mandate" to take part in Medicaid expansion provisions in the law. Actually, the court’s ruling had the opposite effect. It took away Washington’s ability to punish states that don’t take part in the expansion by eliminating their federal Medicaid subsidies. The court ruled states must have "a genuine choice" whether to take part in the expansion. It is perplexing that McDonnell -- a lawyer for 23 years who served as Virginia’s attorney general and now commands a knowledgeable gubernatorial staff -- would repeatedly misrepresent a major part of a landmark decision by the U.S. Supreme Court. Thirty hours after the ruling, McDonnell maintained on national TV that the Medicaid mandate was intact. We rate McDonnell’s statements Pants on Fire.

pomt-13361	"Since I came into office … we have increased the VA budget by 85 percent."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/30/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-va-budget-has-risen-85-percent-h/	During a CNN town hall on Sept. 28, 2016, President Barack Obama took an emotional question from Donna Coates, the widow of Army veteran Barry Coates, who died of cancer after being misdiagnosed at a VA hospital. "My mama's always told me that if you stop talking about stuff and do it, then you don't have to talk about it any longer," Coates said. "So when are we going to actually start holding these contracted doctors and the VA employees accountable?" Obama expressed his sympathies and said, "I don't want to in any way pretend that we're where we need to be." Still, he said, progress has been made in such areas as replacing outdated patient-intake systems. "We now have a situation where about 80 percent of individuals who interact with the VA are satisfied that they're getting timely treatment," he said. "I want that to be 100 percent. And that requires more work." Obama went on to say that "since I came into office, just to give you some sense of perspective, we have increased the VA budget by 85 percent." Even over an eight-year presidential tenure, that sounded like a pretty big increase to us. So we decided to see if it was accurate. Mandatory vs. discretionary spending We turned to VA budget data to see how large the increases have been. This chart summarizes what we found: This chart shows that VA spending has certainly increased since 2008. But we've broken it down into two colors because it’s important to distinguish between two types of funding. The blue portion, known as discretionary spending, is funding that needs to be passed by Congress and signed by the president every year. The red portion, known as mandatory spending, includes funds allocated based on eligibility rules established long before the year when they’re allocated. Examples of mandatory funds include payouts for disability claims, burials, pensions and education. The White House confirmed that the 85 percent increase refers to the entire VA budget, including mandatory and discretionary spending. They said that the Obama administration did have an impact on the mandatory spending figure by enacting increased access to benefits, including expanding eligibility for benefits related to Agent Orange exposure. Still, a large reason for the growth in mandatory spending is that the United States has been engaged in fighting wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, thus creating more and more veterans who qualify for mandatory benefits. So, to a great extent, mandatory spending is on autopilot when a president takes office, meaning that it’s not obvious that Obama can take significant credit for increasing the mandatory portion of the spending bump on his watch. The size of the increases It’s also worth noting that when Obama uses the 85 percent growth figure, he’s choosing the largest of several figures he could have used. There are so many choices because comparing budget growth in the way Obama did is more complicated than it seems at first glance. For starters, fiscal years -- the October-to-October time frames that are typically used in federal budgeting -- do not line up neatly with presidential terms, which always begin on January 20. So one could make an argument that the best base year to use in Obama’s comparison could be either fiscal year 2008 or fiscal year 2009. And the end years are tricky, too. The most recent year for which final, solid dollar figures are available is 2015. For 2016, we only have projections. We ran the numbers for each of the four possible time spans and found that the increase in overall spending ranged from 67 percent at the low end to 86 percent on the high end. So Obama’s 85 percent figure is cherry-picked, although even the worst calculation for Obama shows a 67 percent increase, which is still pretty substantial. Remember, however, that the president has the most influence -- along with Congress, with whom Obama had to agree -- on the discretionary portion of the VA budget. And the increases in discretionary spending were smaller. For discretionary spending only, the same four possible calculations produce anything from a 36 percent increase to a 61 percent increase. That's a less impressive sounding claim -- at the low end, it’s an increase of roughly 4 percent a year, rather than 10 percent a year, as Obama’s original statement would suggest. That said, Stan Collender, a budget specialist and executive vice president of the firm Qorvis MSLGROUP, cautioned that even an increase of 4 percent a year "is nothing to sneeze at these days in federal budget land. I doubt many other parts of the discretionary budget had increases of that size, or at all." Our ruling Obama said, "Since I came into office … we have increased the VA budget by 85 percent." Obama has a point that the VA has seen significant percentage increases during his tenure, particularly for a period of budgetary belt-tightening elsewhere. However, it’s a stretch for him to take credit for that, since so much of the increase stemmed from mandatory spending that originated with a continuing stream of veterans returning home and qualifying for benefits. Obama has also cherry-picked the highest numerical figure he could have. His statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/31e464bc-18c7-4796-aadf-5c9cb65de6c7	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2016-09-30T10:00:00	2016-09-28	['None']
pomt-09063	It was President Obama's "inaction that caused over three weeks to go by before he even approved the governor's plan to protect our marsh."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/29/steve-scalise/scalise-blames-obama-inaction-berm-plan-contain-oi/	Many Republicans say President Barack Obama has moved too slowly in response to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., criticized the president's Oval Office speech and cited slow action in building sand barriers to absorb the oil. "Tonight the president actually said that he won't tolerate inaction," Scalise said on Sean Hannity's show on Fox News shortly after the speech on June 15, 2010. "Yet it was his inaction that caused over three weeks to go by before he even approved the governor's plan to protect our marsh and put up those sand barriers which covered 25 percent of the plan that was submitted by our local leaders." Scalise is referring to a plan proposed May 11 by Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal that the federal government build barrier islands of sand to intercept oil before it hit Louisiana's wetlands. The plan is based on the idea that oil is easier to get out of sand than wetlands, which are an important part of the state's ecosystems. (Read our previous ruling on Jindal's plan here.) We were interested in determining how long it took Obama to implement Gov. Jindal's plan. Now some people have questioned whether Jindal's entire plan could be completed quickly enough to capture the oil before it reached the wetlands. Some scientists have also warned that in the long term, the berms could do more harm than good. They could change coastal currents and further degrade the already extremely fragile coastline. Some suggested that construction of the berms could damage oil and gas pipelines and that dredging the sand to build the berms could cause a change in water salinity that could harm the fish population. Although Scalise refers to "inaction," records indicate that federal agencies have been assessing the proposal since May 11. The Corps of Engineers says it received the plan at 11 p.m. on May 11. The Corps solicited interagency comments in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act, and provided those comments to the state of Louisiana. On May 14, the state resubmitted a revised plan based off of the comments. The Corps then solicited a second round of comments and began to discuss technical analyses with the state. On May 21 and May 24, the state submitted additional information, and on May 27, the plan was approved to build berms in six of the 24 proposed sections. On June 2nd, the White House approved of the idea that BP would pay and on June 3rd, BP agreed to pay the estimated $360 million cost. That certainly seems like quite a bit of action to us. According to Scalise spokesman Stephen Bell, Scalise was counting from May 11 to June 3, when BP agreed to pay, because the governor never planned to pay for the berms at the cost of the Louisiana taxpayers. According to that math, the time would be just over three weeks. But we think it's important to note that the Army Corps of Engineers approved Jindal's plan on May 27, two weeks and two days after he proposed it. And then it was June 3 when BP agreed to cover the cost. Scalise said President Obama's "inaction ... caused over three weeks to go by before he even approved the governor's plan." It's the word "inaction" here that is most troubling because it suggests nothing was going on when in fact something was happening to address Jindal's idea. Per protocol, the Corps solicited interagency comments, shared them with the state of Louisiana, received a revised plan, solicited comments on it and then approved the plan May 27. Within a week, the money was in place. The omission of this context leads us to rule Scalise's statement Half True.	None	Steve Scalise	None	None	None	2010-06-29T14:35:16	2010-06-15	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-12750	"Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/28/donald-trump/fact-checking-donald-trumps-claim-about-soaring-ob/	President Donald Trump zeroed in on repealing the Affordable Care Act in his first address to Congress, saying the federal health care law has been a "disaster" that has caused premiums to skyrocket. "Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits," Trump said on Feb. 28, 2017. He then cited a 116 percent increase in Arizona as an example. When Trump says "Obamacare," he’s not talking about everyone who benefitted from President Barack Obama’s signature health care law. He’s referring to premiums for insurance plans on the federal insurance exchange. Premiums for those plans did increase in the past year, drawing criticism from Republicans that the system had failed. But Trump is leaving out a significant part of the story. An off year When officials and policy wonks talk about premium increases, there’s a commonly used benchmark employed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The agency takes a look at the average cost in each county for the second-lowest-cost silver level plan for a 27-year-old. That allows a comparison of rates between years and different parts of the country. In its Oct. 24, 2016, brief, HHS showed that premiums rose an average of 25 percent across the 39 states that use the HealthCare.gov marketplace. As an average, that means some places saw higher increases than others. Oklahoma saw a 69 percent hike, for example, while Arkansas premiums only went up 2 percent. For the record, Arizona is the only state where premiums went up by triple digits. And in Indiana, premiums actually decreased in 2017. (It was the only state where that happened.) The 25 percent average increase is much higher than the earlier years of the Affordable Care Act. Premiums went up about 7 percent in 2016 and 3 percent in 2015. It’s also much higher than the increases people who acquired health care through an employer saw. In a survey of 425 large employers, the National Business Group on Health estimated that workers who get insurance through their jobs — which most people do — would see a 2017 increase of about 5 or 6 percent. The sudden jump is due in part because portions of the law designed to keep costs artificially low have ended or didn’t work as originally intended. Reinsurance kept premiums for high-cost policyholders low by transferring money to their plans. A program called risk corridors was designed to share money from profitable insurers with companies that lost money, but was targeted by Republicans. Both programs ended as planned for 2017, so many premiums went up considerably to more closely match what it actually costs insurers to offer policies on the exchange. An Urban Institute report said that underpricing was the norm in the early years of the health care law, so the jump this year was a short-term correction. There are other factors, too: Health care costs still are rising each year, though not as much as before the Affordable Care Act. There also are annual changes in who signs up, changes in provider networks and so on. "Price increases are lower than we would have expected without exchanges in place," said Rena Conti, a health economist at the University of Chicago. Enrollment for 2017 also went up, even with higher premiums and a possibility the law could be repealed. Close to 6.4 million people signed up for policies through the marketplace, about 400,000 more than last year. (Trump also doesn’t mention that the Medicaid expansion portion of the law accounts for more than half of newly covered patients.) David Himmelstein, a professor in the CUNY School of Public Health at Hunter College, noted something else not said by Trump. While premiums for some did go up significantly, most people buying these plans aren’t paying those increases. "More than 70 percent of people who purchase coverage through the exchanges receive subsidies, and they will not pay any more for their coverage since their share is fixed," Himmelsten said. "Government will pick up any increase, and government costs for Obamacare have actually been lower than initially predicted." Our ruling Trump said, "Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits." Many people purchasing health care through federal and state insurance marketplaces did see double-digit premium increases, and one, Arizona, saw a larger increase. But as we have noted in previous fact-checks, Trump’s talking point doesn’t accurately reflect the situation overall. Several states did not see such dramatic premium changes, and experts say that health care costs broadly are increasing at a lower rate than before the health care law took effect. Most people get their health care through the employer, which hasn’t seen the same premium spikes. And for people on the health care exchanges, federal subsidies are offsetting premium increases for many. Trump’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

pomt-00752	"The president and vice president can't be from the same state."	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/apr/16/lawrence-odonnell/president-vice-president-same-state-allowed/	The links between Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio have some talking about a Bush/Rubio ticket in 2016. But is it even possible? The day after Rubio announced he was running for president, liberal MSNBC host Lawrence O’Donnell was already looking ahead to what happens if Rubio’s campaign falls short. "Marco Rubio looks like one of the best possible vice presidential candidates in the Republican field," O’Donnell said on his show on April 14, 2015. "But the one person who can’t choose him is Jeb Bush, because the president and vice president can't be from the same state." While we're still waiting for Bush to make his candidacy official, O'Donnell's claim that "the president and vice president can't be from the same state," got our heads spinning. If correct, that would rule out a Florida ticket of Bush/Rubio, or a Texas ticket of Rick Perry and Ted Cruz for that matter, or any combination that includes Bush, Rubio and two other Florida residents and possible contenders -- Ben Carson and Mike Huckabee. So is it true? The answer is no. Neither the Constitution nor the Electoral College prevents Bush from picking a fellow Floridian or any candidate from choosing a running mate from the same state. It just might make things tricky, depending on the situation. We'll explain the why and how. What the Constitution has to say about electing presidents While registered voters select their preferred candidate for president, the actual electing of the president and vice president is in the hands of the Electoral College. There are 538 electors representing the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Candidates need a majority, 270, to win. Those electors cast a separate vote for president and vice president. But that wasn't always the case. From 1789-1804, Electoral College members got to vote for two men (and back then, it was only men). The top vote-getter became president and the second-place winner became vice president. There was one caveat. Electoral College voters, called electors, could not cast both of their votes for two people from their home state. In plainspeak, an Electoral College member from Maryland couldn’t cast his two votes for candidates from Maryland. Electors from any other state could still vote for two Maryland representatives, just not the electors from Maryland. The idea behind the restriction was to dilute the power of the big states and to encourage electors to look beyond their political allies. Here’s the text from Article II of the Constitution: "The electors shall meet in their respective states, and vote by ballot for two persons, of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves." In 1804, the Twelfth Amendment altered the Electoral College process and created a separate ballot for vice president. But the rule of not being able to use both votes on a person from an elector's home state remained in effect. What does it all mean? Let's use the Bush/Rubio hypothetical. Bush could choose Rubio to be his running mate. And if the two won, Florida's 29 electors could vote to make Bush president, but not to make Rubio vice president (or vice versa). If Bush and Rubio started with 299 electoral votes or more, that wouldn't matter and Rubio would still be vice president. But if the election were close, things would get complicated. This is how it gets complicated We don't have to look too far back to find an example of how this could play out. "We actually flirted with the problem in the 2000 election where both George W. Bush and Dick Cheney had called Texas home in the runup to the nomination," said Robert Bennett, a law professor at Northwestern University and the author of Taming the Electoral College. Cheney sidestepped the issue by registering to vote in Wyoming, the state he once represented in the House. It's good he did. Bush/Cheney wound up with 271 electoral votes. Take away Texas' 32 electoral votes from Cheney's tally and he wouldn't have hit the required 270. Here’s how the 2000 map looked: So what would have happened if Cheney stayed a Texas resident? And what could happen with Bush and Rubio (or another same-state pair)? There are few scenarios. One possible scenario is the Electoral College would vote to elect the new president but not elect the vice president. In that case, the election of the next vice president would become the work of the U.S. Senate, where each senator would get one vote. If that vote is miraculously tied -- well, we’re not sure what would happen next. Some people say the sitting vice president might get to break the tie. Others note that the vice president is not a senator, which is the process spelled out in the Twelfth Amendment. (Imagine if Joe Biden got to vote for himself to break a tie in 2012.) Another possible scenario is that the Electoral College would vote to elect a new vice president and not a president. In this case, the U.S. House of Representatives would break that deadlock, with members of each state casting a single vote. A majority wins. In the case of Bush/Cheney, it never got that far. In the Bush/Rubio exercise, the fact that Republicans control the Senate and House (and a majority of the state delegations) improves their odds of prevailing. But it's definitely a risk. John Harrison, a leading constitutional scholar at the University of Virginia School of Law, offered another hypothetical option looking ahead to 2016. "The Florida Republican Party might seek an amendment to Florida law so that non-Floridians could serve as electors, and nominate a slate of, say, Georgians, who could come down for the day in December when the electors give their vote," Harrison suggested. Harrison added that the Constitution is silent about whether electors must come from the state that appoints them. Harrison acknowledges that this question could be argued (in court) either way. Our ruling O’Donnell said the president and vice president can't be from the same state. That’s incorrect, there is no law or regulation preventing a ticket from coming from the same state. All the Constitution does is prevent electors in the Electoral College from voting for a president and vice president who are both from their home state. In many elections, that actually wouldn't matter. President Barack Obama could have picked a running mate from Illinois in 2008 and 2012 with no ill effect. Ditto for Bill Clinton's victories in 1992 and 1996, George H.W. Bush's 1988 win and Ronald Reagan's victories in 1980 and 1984. But in a close election, the Electoral College quirk could matter (as well as the hoops people might try to work around it). That makes the possibility of an all Florida ticket risky, but not illegal or impossible. We rate the claim False.	None	Lawrence O'Donnell	None	None	None	2015-04-16T18:25:34	2015-04-14	['None']
pomt-06672	"Two days of interest we pay to China is enough to buy one joint strike fighter [jet]."	true	/georgia/statements/2011/sep/09/tom-graves/does-jet-claim-fly-straight/	Like many congressional freshmen, Republican Rep. Tom Graves of Georgia is worried about the nation’s spiraling debt and how much of it is owned by China. Graves, whose district consists of 15 northwest Georgia counties, including Forsyth, talked about the problem of deficit spending at a recent town hall meeting. "Two days of interest we pay to China is enough to buy one joint strike fighter [jet]," Graves told the largely receptive crowd, according to the Cumming Patch website. Those aircraft usually cost astronomical sums of money, so we wondered whether the congressman’s math was correct. On average, does the United States really pay that much money in debt to China? Or did Graves use hyperbole to scare his town hall audience about the rapidly growing economic influence of China? Our friends at PolitiFact Virginia did some of our homework for us. In April, they fact-checked a claim by U.S. Rep. J. Randy Forbes, R-Va., that the federal government pays China nearly $74 million a day in debt interest. PolitiFact Virginia found U.S. Treasury Department reports that show China holds about $1.165 trillion of the national debt. In the most recent 12-month period available, the U.S. spent about $197 billion in interest payments on its debt. Since China owns about 12.8 percent of the U.S. debt, PolitiFact Virginia assumed that country received a similar percentage of the debt interest payments, which for fiscal year 2010 would total nearly $69 million a day. But since the debt increased in the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, PolitiFact Virginia did some more math and determined the interest payments to China would be $74.4 million a day, which earned Forbes a True rating on its Truth-O-Meter. Two days of interest payments would total nearly $150 million. So, the next question: How much do these jets cost? The cost to produce a joint strike fighter jet, also known as the F-35, has caused a stir in Washington in recent months. They’re being made by Lockheed Martin, which has a plant in Marietta, and are said to be the most technologically advanced jets ever developed. The jets are being made for the Air Force, Marines and Navy. For the Marines and Navy, it will be the first time they have stealth jets, said Joe DellaVedova, a spokesman for the F-35 Joint Program Office. They’re also very expensive, and some members of Congress are angry about the rising costs. Defense Department officials recently told the U.S. Senate’s Armed Services Committee that the cost for some of the initial planes ordered was 11 percent to 15 percent higher than expected. "Disgraceful," tweeted U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Az., who has been critical of F-35 cost overruns. Cost estimates are all over the place in news accounts. The most accurate estimate came from a Defense Department report that officials say was leaked to the news media a few months ago. The price to build and operate 2,443 of the jets was recently estimated to be about $93 million to $112 million apiece, according to a 2010 Pentagon report. DellaVedova did not dispute the cost estimate. So if we take two days of interest payments, which we believe adds up to about $150 million, that total does eclipse the highest estimate for a F-35 jet, $112 million. Graves’ office estimates the total cost per jet at about $132 million, using a July report from the Congressional Research Service. It used the PolitiFact Virginia report to determine the average daily debt payment to China. We believe Graves has a good argument to base his claim. We rate it as True.

pomt-06637	Hurricane "Irene was the second-largest storm to hit North America in terms of power outages -- and the first hurricane to make landfall in New Jersey since 1904."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/sep/16/jersey-central-power-light/jcpl-says-hurricane-irene-was-second-largest-storm/	When Hurricane Irene roared ashore last month in New Jersey and along parts of the East Coast, the storm killed people, destroyed homes, ruined belongings and caused unprecedented flooding. It also left more than 7 million people in North America without power, according to Jersey Central Power and Light. "In fact, Irene was the second-largest storm to hit North America in terms of power outages – and the first hurricane to make landfall in New Jersey since 1904," according to an advertisement the company published in the Sept. 7 Star-Ledger. PolitiFact New Jersey checked that statistic with a number of weather and energy experts, many of whom agree that Irene is one of the worst storms to hit North America. However, at least one organization puts the number of outages at 9 million. First, let’s look at how JCP&L arrived at its statistic. Spokesman Ron Morano said the company’s research was focused on the costliest and most destructive hurricanes – those affecting large population areas and multiple states. Among them: Hurricane Ike in 2008, which affected customers in 10 states and Canada; and Irene, which affected people in 14 states and the District of Columbia. Irene also entered Canada, but lost its tropical characteristics by the time it crossed the border, said Dennis Feltgen, spokesman for the National Hurricane Center in Miami. JCP&L reviewed a 2009 report by Jeff Masters, a meteorologist and co-founder of the Weather Underground website, that states Ike disrupted power to 7.5 million people. JCP&L also looked at utility reports, press releases from affected utility companies, information from the U.S. Department Of Energy, the National Weather Service, and news articles about Irene that supported data in Masters’ report, Morano said in an email. Morano provided a list of 16 major utility companies along the East Coast that reported 7,070,000 power outages during Irene. More than 670,000 of JCP&L’s 1.1 million customers were among those without power. JCP&L struggled to restore service in Irene's aftermath, and some customers reported being without power for eight days. The company, in press releases, said delays in restoring power were caused by the volume of outages, the location of some problems and continued flooding. Partly because of JCP&L's storm response, public hearings are planned to discuss with the state's utility companies how to improve response for the next storm. "Based on the most recent information, Irene is all but certain to top 7.5 million customers affected," Morano wrote. "Nothing in our research indicates a hurricane has impacted more than 7.5 million customers in North America." But figures still vary. The Department of Energy’s Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability reported a high of 5.9 million customers with outages during Irene, but cautioned that its data does not include all utility companies. The same office reported a high of approximately 3.8 million outages for Ike. A spokesman for the Washington, DC-based Edison Electric Institute said its outages tally for investor-owned electric companies is approximately 9 million. Municipal power companies and cooperatives are not included in that figure, said spokesman Dan Riedinger. The institute represents approximately 70 percent of the U.S. electric power industry. Given the institute’s estimate – which is in line with figures reported by the Associated Press on Aug. 30 and Sept. 1 for communities from the Carolinas to Maine -- wouldn’t that make Irene, not Ike, the largest storm to hit North America in terms of power outages? "I’m 99 percent sure in terms of the storm that that is correct but we just can’t confirm it yet," Riedinger said. Still, Ike’s ranking is a bit dubious. Since numerous agencies and experts we contacted said there’s no way to quantify an exact number of outages – and, therefore, rank them -- we asked Masters how he was able to do that for the 2009 report cited by JCP&L. "All I did was go through the Wikipedia pages for every major hurricane power outage event of the past 40 years," he said in an email. "Not authoritative at all. I put a plea on the post that if anyone knew of better sources of power outage data, they should contact me, but no one did." Wikipedia is an online database where anyone can enter or edit information on a particular subject, regardless of accuracy. As for the other part of JCP&L’s statement, both David Robinson, New Jersey’s state climatologist, and Feltgen said the last hurricane before Irene to make landfall in New Jersey was in 1903 – not 1904, as JCP&L’s ad stated. Our ruling JCP&L says Hurricane Irene was the second-largest storm to hit North America in terms of power outages, with at least 7 million customers affected. Several experts we spoke with offer power outage ranges from 5.9 million to 9 million, noting that not every utility company is included in those estimates. Prior to Irene, Ike in 2008 reportedly caused 7.5 million outages, but some sourcing of that data comes from an online database with questionable accuracy issues. Still, JCP&L’s overall point about Irene being a major storm that caused millions to lose power is valid. We rate this claim Mostly True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-08127	"Ohio is losing over 700 family farms a year, some of them just to pay the inheritance tax."	true	/ohio/statements/2010/dec/09/jim-zehringer/rep-jim-zehringer-point-comment-loss-family-farms-/	Echoing Gov.-elect John Kasich’s pledge to cut taxes, Ohio’s incoming agriculture chief recently called for the elimination of the state’s estate tax. The tax has contributed to the declining number of family farms in Ohio, said State Rep. Jim Zehringer, a Republican from Northwest Ohio whom Kasich recently picked to lead the state’s Department of Agriculture. "Ohio is losing over 700 family farms a year, some of them just to pay the inheritance tax," Zehringer said at a Nov. 16 news conference at which Kasich introduced him as the new agriculture director. Kasich, a Republican who defeated Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland in November, has specifically called for the elimination of the tax, which Zehringer referred to as the inheritance tax, because he believes it punishes success. An estate tax is levied on the net value of an estate before its assets are transferred to anyone else. PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look, given the farming remains one of Ohio’s key industries. First we looked to see if the number of family farms actually is decreasing at the rate Zehringer claims. Rob Nichols, a spokesman for John Kasich, said Zehringer based his claim on the United States Department of Agriculture’s statistics, specifically, an agricultural census the department conducts every five years. For his assessment, Zehringer compared figures for one classification of family farms. The USDA, however, also counts "family-held corporations" within its definition of family farms, according to Amanda Pomicter of the USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service. Family-held corporations represent only a fraction of family farms in Ohio, but their inclusion does color the picture of how fast the number of family farms are shrinking in the state. Here is a comparison over the last 15 years of the figures Zehringer used and statistics that include family-held corporations. Year Family farms only Family farms and corps 1992 60,936 62,538 1997 69,123 71,099 2002 70,890 72,579 2007 66,382 69,131 Nichols told us that Zehringer used the most recent of these five-year stretches for his assertion. Ohio lost 4,508 family farms in that span for an average of about 902 farms a year. If the statistics Zehringer used showed a 900-farm-per-year decline, why did he ballpark the annual losses at 700? He was being conservative, Nichols said. Had Zehringer also included in his analysis farms owned by family-held corporations, he might have reduced the annual decline even further. In the same five year stretch, using the figures the USDA prefers, Ohio lost 3,448 family farms for an average of 690 lost farms per year. The U.S. Department of Agriculture won’t begin counting farms for its 2012 census until the end of that year, so the figures for 2007 represent the most recent available data. Another point of clarity is needed for Zehringer’s assertion that the state’s inheritance tax is causing the state to lose family farms. John Kohlstrand, a spokesman for the Department of Taxation, said the state does not have an inheritance tax. He said inheritance taxes apply to each individual who receives property from an estate. Ohio has an estate tax, which is levied on the net value of an estate before its assets are transferred to anyone else. In e-mails, Nichols told us that was what Zehringer was referring to and that it is "universally known" that some family farms are sold because the estate tax could not be paid. In Ohio, estates worth $338,333 or less are effectively exempt from the state estate tax due to a tax credit, which is available to all estates, of up to $13,900. A 6 percent tax rate applies to estates worth between $338,334 and $500,000. For estates worth more than $500,000, the tax is $9,700 plus 7 percent of the estate’s value. A federal estate tax also exists. It was phased out in 2010 as part of the Bush tax cuts that are set to expire at the end of the year, pending an extension by Congress. The U.S. Agriculture Department does not track how many family farms are lost due to estate taxes, said James Ramey, director of the Ohio field office of the USDA’s National Agriculture Statistics Service. Neither does the Ohio Farm Bureau Federation. But Joe Cornely, the bureau’s spokesman, said Zehringer is "absolutely right" that the Ohio estate tax contributes to the decline in family farms. Sometimes a chunk of a farm is sold to pay federal and state estate taxes and, as a result, the farm is no longer commercially viable, Cornely said. The federal estate tax is more burdensome, but "inheritance taxes, regardless whether it’s state or federal, can have negative consequences on the heirs," he said The food and agriculture industries are a $98 billion business in Ohio. The loss of family farms, particularly in light of Kasich’s commitment to job creation, is sure to be something the incoming Agriculture chief will monitor. Zehringer’s data is somewhat dated, and he didn’t include all types of family farms in his analysis. His statement is not far off the annual decline found in Ohio using statistics the USDA prefers. And ultimately, the differences in numbers don’t impact his underlying point. As for the estate tax’s role in the decline, it’s difficult to say exactly how many family farms were lost for that reason. But Cornely, an authority on Ohio agriculture, said his is sure "some" of the loses would be due to taxes. We rate the statement True.

pomt-11349	"Paul Ryan has blocked all action to strengthen our gun laws."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/apr/06/giffords/gabrielle-giffords-group-claims-gun-rights-backer-/	After the Florida school shooting that left 17 people dead, news reports said U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan had thrown cold water on, and shown little interest in, new proposals for gun control. But an attack on the Wisconsin Republican by Giffords PAC, a political action committee named for Gabrielle Giffords, went much further. Ryan "has blocked all action to strengthen our gun laws," Giffords PAC claimed in an online ad released March 13, 2018. As the House speaker since October 2015, Ryan holds one of the most powerful positions in Washington, although other lawmakers, such as committee chairs, have influence over the fate of legislation. And all, of course, is an extreme word. So, let’s see what the record shows on Ryan and gun laws during his time as speaker. Giffords PAC Giffords is a former Democratic U.S. House member from Arizona. In 2011, she was shot while meeting with constituents in Tucson. The shooter killed six people and wounded 13 others. Giffords PAC describes itself as backing elected officials and candidates "who step up to fight the gun violence epidemic." Two weeks before releasing the Ryan ad, the PAC launched a campaign that included Ryan as one of six lawmakers on a #VoteThemOut list. Two Democrats are running for the southern Wisconsin seat held by Ryan, who hasn’t yet announced whether he will run for re-election in November 2018. The PAC’s evidence To back its attack on Ryan, Giffords PAC cited a dozen pieces of gun legislation that were pending since Ryan became speaker. Here are five, each of which was referred to a House committee, but was not voted out of that committee for a vote by the full House: Bill Key provision HR 1217 Reauthorize grants for improvements to the criminal history record system HR 2216 Prohibits sale of gun to person who is subject to restraining order HR 3130 Makes it crime to knowingly give/sell gun to person convicted of misdemeanor stalking HR 1475 Prohibits giving false or misleading material information in connection with a firearm purchase or transfer HR 1478 Ends prohibition on U.S. Department of Health and Human Services using federal funds to promote gun control Giffords PAC argues that the bills were blocked by Ryan by virtue of the fact that the main power of the House speaker -- as explained by a Washington Post primer on House leadership -- "derives from his or her ability to determine what bills come to the floor for debate and a vote." But the PAC provided no evidence that Ryan actually took steps to block the bills. And bills can be blocked by other lawmakers, such as committee chairs. Now to whether there are gun measures that Ryan has not blocked. Ryan’s response To refute the attack, Ryan’s campaign organization cited three measures that passed the House: Measure Key provisions HR 2646 More beds for people with mental illness who need short-term hospitalization HR 4909 Grants to improve school security, including with metal detectors, and to fund training, threat assessments, school and police coordination HR 38 Let people with concealed carry license bring guns across state lines; strengthen National Instant Criminal Background Check System The first two bills make no reference to guns, even if the school measure is aimed at fighting gun violence. The other bill, however, did strengthen background checks, even if it it would also permit additional transportation of guns across state lines. Ryan’s campaign also argued that Ryan has not stood in the way of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives from banning bump stocks -- which accelerate a gun’s firing speed -- with regulations using existing law. But it’s not clear that ATF could do so without new legislation; indeed, the Justice Department has said it does not have the legal authority under current law to do so. And Ryan has indicated that the House would not take up a bill that would explicitly allow a ban. Our rating Giffords PAC says: "Paul Ryan has blocked all action to strengthen our gun laws." The anti-gun violence political action committee cited a dozen gun-control measures that didn’t get to a vote in the House. So, it’s clear that Ryan did not move to bring those measures to the floor. But that’s not the same as Ryan himself blocking the measures, given that other lawmakers, such as committee chairs, also have such power. Also, a bill that would strengthen background checks did pass the House -- although it also expanded gun rights, by making it legal for licensed concealed carry holders to bring guns across state lines.

pomt-01713	Michelle Nunn’s "foundation directed grants to an Islamic group tied to radical terrorists."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2014/aug/08/ending-spending-action-fund/attack-ad-misfires-nonprofits-connection-terrorism/	Michelle Nunn’s U.S. Senate campaign recently had to own up to accidentally posting the details of its election strategy for all the world -- and the opposition -- to see. Within days, one of Nunn’s vocal critics, the conservative Ending Spending Action Fund, was on television with a 30-second ad playing off information from the leaked campaign memo. "What does Michelle Nunn worry about most?" the announcer asks. "It’s not the economy, and it’s not you." The ad tries to tag Nunn with labels that her campaign strategists said in the memo they were anticipating: Nunn’s "too liberal," a "lightweight" a "rubber stamp for Democrats" and "not a real Georgian." But the ad’s headline point is more ominous. "Her foundation directed grants to an Islamic group tied to radical terrorists," the announcer states. "If Nunn supporters are worried, shouldn’t we be, too?" Video of what appears to be armed terrorists is background for part of the ad. PolitiFact decided to fact-check the statement about Nunn, who has spent her career in nonprofits. She became CEO of Points of Light Foundation, the service-oriented organization inspired by President George H.W. Bush, in 2007. Nunn is on leave while campaigning. Ending Spending Action Fund, a political action committee founded by Joe Ricketts, former CEO of TD Ameritrade, has spent more than $1 million on Nunn attack ads since April. Ending Spending president Brian Baker told PolitiFact Georgia last month that the group opposed two candidates this year, Nunn and Republican U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey. Both jumped in the race to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Georgia, but Gingrey was knocked out in the crowded GOP primary that Perdue ultimately won. In July, PolitiFact Georgia rated as Mostly True an Ending Spending ad claim that Nunn earned as much as $300,000 from Points of Light after the non-profit had laid of 90 workers (due to a merger). The contest between Nunn, daughter of retired U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn, and Perdue, cousin of former Gov. Sonny Perdue, is one of the most closely watched of this year’s elections. The prospect of Democrats winning a Senate seat in Republican-controlled Georgia is energizing for Nunn and her party. They want to reclaim a Georgia Senate seat and keep control of the Senate chamber for the last two years of President Barack Obama’s term. Republicans need six seats to claim the Senate majority. For our fact-check of the newest ad from Ending Spending, we contacted Baker, asking for evidence to back up the ad’s claims. He sent us a document based largely on the Nunn campaign’s 144-page internal memo and a story in National Review, the conservative magazine that broke the story of the leaked memo. On July 28th, National Review Online reported that Points of Light had made grants totalling more than $33,000 to Islamic Relief USA, one of a global network of charities that’s under the umbrella of Islamic Relief Worldwide. In June, Israel’s defense minister labeled Islamic Relief Worldwide an "unauthorised association" and has prevented the group from operating in Israel and the West Bank, citing its links to the Palestinian and U.S.-designated terrorist group Hamas.. In a web posting, officials with Islamic Relief Worldwide said the organization "is extremely surprised and concerned by this and categorically denies any links with Hamas." Stefanie Weiss, Points of Light’s communications director, told us the nonprofit "has never had any dealings with or given any grants to Hamas or any known terrorist group." From 2003 to 2011, MissionFish was a Points of Light business unit that allowed eBay sellers and buyers to direct all or part of the proceeds from a transaction to their favorite charity, Weiss said. EBay users could donate to any of 20,000 organizations, all of which were registered 501(c)(3) nonprofits or the overseas equivalent, she said. "These nonprofits were vetted regularly to ensure tax-exempt status, good standing with the IRS, and exclusion from terrorist watch lists," Weiss said. Islamic Relief USA was one of them and "remains an eBay Giving Works-approved charity," she said. (Points of Light sold MissionFish to eBay in 2011.) Points of Lights’ IRS 990s show Islamic Relief USA, which describes itself as an independent affiliate of Islamic Relief Worldwide, received about $13,500 in contributions from eBay buyers and sellers in 2006, 2007 and 2010. National Review has corrected its story to show that the $33,000 figure was in error. Nathan Click, spokesman for the Nunn campaign, called the ad a "false and ridiculous attack against Points of Light -- an organization founded by President George H.W. Bush that mobilizes million of volunteers each year." He said this kind of attack "is exactly what Georgians are ready to change about our political process." Our Ruling Just the mention of the word Islamic can ignite strong emotions in some people. And those working to block Nunn’s candidacy clearly know that and hope the ad will work in their favor. Our research showed the group that Points of Light dealt with -- Islamic Relief USA -- is an approved charity and not on the U.S.’s terrorist watch list. But the record of its umbrella organization, Islamic Relief Worldwide, is not clear. Leaders of IRW deny any connection to Hamas. But a top Israeli official in June banned Islamic Relief Worldwide from working in the country, saying terrorist connections exist. The ad says Nunn's foundation "directed money."

pomt-10965	"Hillary in hiding as police discover dead body hidden in Huma Abedin’s dumpster."	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/jul/19/blog-posting/misleading-headline-exaggerates-connection-between/	A misleading headline purporting to link Hillary Clinton and top aide Huma Abedin to a mysterious New York death has blown a small connection way out of proportion. "Hillary in hiding as police discover dead body hidden in Huma Abedin’s dumpster," said a July 12, 2018, headline from Mad World News, a conservative website that has peddled falsehoods before. This story was flagged as part Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) "Another dead body has turned up in connection to Hillary Clinton," the story said. "This time, the remains of a woman were found in a dumpster at Huma Abedin’s New York apartment. Hillary has gone into hiding as Huma’s neighbors told the cops they believe the death has something to do with Anthony Weiner’s recent conviction." Authorities did find a woman dead in the trash compartment of a New York apartment building on July 10, 2018. But allegations implicating Clinton or Abedin in the incident are uncorroborated. Let’s take a look at what actually happened, according to credible reports detailing the tragedy. On July 10, police responded to Zeckendorf Towers, an upscale apartment complex in New York. There, they "discovered a 48-year-old female unconscious and unresponsive inside a trash compactor," police told the New York Post. The woman, who was later identified as building resident Lara Prychenko, was found by a maintenance worker. Surveillance video later showed her in a nearby elevator moments earlier, where she left her handbag before entering the hallway. Police later told reporters they believed she may have fallen down the chute while drunk. Abedin and her ex-husband, imprisoned former congressman Anthony Weiner, previously owned an apartment in the same complex. The former couple reportedly owned the apartment for multiple years, but listed it for rent on March 19, 2017, the same day Weiner pleaded guilty for explicit texts to a minor and Abedin filed for divorce. The listing was taken off the market days later, though it is not clear whether the apartment was sold or taken off the market for another reason. Most news outlets referred to the building as a place that Abedin "used to call home." Regardless, the trash compactor where the dead woman was found was commonly shared. It was not "Abedin’s dumpster," despite what the Mad World News story said. Further, apartment residents did not tell cops and NBC "they believe the death has something to do with Anthony Weiner’s recent conviction." According to the NBC report cited in the Mad World News story, the neighbors actually "said they initially thought the police presence had something to do with the building's famous resident, Anthony Weiner." Clinton, for her part, has not actually gone into hiding. She has been active criticizing President Donald Trump and promoting her upcoming events on Twitter and Facebook. Three days after the body was discovered, she addressed a teachers union conference in Pittsburgh. She is also set to attend a festival in New York on July 21, 2018, according to her Twitter. The New York Police Department did not respond to a request for comment. Our ruling A headline said, "Hillary in hiding as police discover dead body hidden in Huma Abedin’s dumpster." A dead body turned up in the trash compactor at the same apartment building that Abedin used to call home, but we could not find any evidence that Abedin and Clinton played any role in the incident or were implicated in the police investigation.

pomt-01367	"In the past three years, we have prosecuted or brought more cases on access to public records than in the previous 12 years combined."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/oct/18/peter-kilmartin/has-atty-gen-peter-kilmartin-prosecuted-more-publi/	Rhode Island has long been a battleground in the fight for open government. Public bodies vote in secret. Deals are cut behind closed doors. Police departments withhold arrest records and daily logs. A report issued last month by ACCESS/RI found a "troubling level of non-compliance" with the state's open records law and called for enhanced oversight by the Attorney General's office. During an interview with Rhode Island Public Radio that aired on Oct. 2, 2014, incumbent Atty. Gen. Peter Kilmartin, a Democrat, was asked about enforcement of the open records law. He lamented that some public bodies are not following the law despite repeated attempts to educate government officials about the documents that are supposed to be public. "Unfortunately, in the past three years, we have prosecuted or brought more cases on access to public records than in the previous 12 years combined," he said. "That tells me there is still a problem." It's a statement he repeated on Oct. 10, 2014, during a taping of a debate on WPRI-TV with Republic Dawson Hodgson. We were interested in whether Kilmartin has brought more open records cases to court than his two predecessors, Patrick Lynch (now a lawyer in private practice) and Sheldon Whitehouse (now a U.S. Senator). When we asked Kilmartin's office for a tally of the cases, spokeswoman Amy Kempe sent us a list of 18 civil lawsuits dating as far back as 2002. "There were no lawsuits from 1999 to 2002," she said in an email. According to the list, Whitehouse took one case to court, suing the Anthony fire district in 2002. During Lynch's eight years in office he filed seven suits -- against public entities in Johnston, North Kingstown, Cranston, Woonsocket and Lincoln. Barrington was sued twice. Since 2011, according to the list, Kilmartin has filed 10 suits against public entities for violating the open records law, starting with the Albion Fire District in Lincoln (which Lynch also sued) and ending most recently with the town of Warren. We spot-checked Kilmartin's cases using our archives. To check the list of his predecessors, we first contacted the offices of Lynch and Whitehouse to ask if Kilmartin was omitting any cases. Whitehouse's office said the number seems correct. Repeated inquiries to Lynch's law office produced no response. So we turned to court records and received a list of all civil suits brought by Whitehouse and Lynch against public bodies. Once again, Kilmartin's tally checked out. In summary, Peter Kilmartin said that in the past three years, his office has "prosecuted or brought more cases on access to public records than in the previous 12 years combined." His office has filed 10 suits since 2011. Lynch had seven during his eight years as Attorney General. Whitehouse had just one during his four years in that office. We can't say if the trend is due to previous attorneys general being less aggressive in prosecuting violations of the state's open government laws than Kilmartin, or if public bodies are getting more brazen in ignoring them. Certainly the latest ACCESS/RI report offers evidence that the phrase "open government" is -- for some of Rhode Island's "public" bodies -- an oxymoron. Rhode Island's culture of secrecy persists, but Kilmartin has filed more lawsuits than his two predecessors conbined so we rate Kilmartin's claim as True.

pomt-06937	"I did not vote to spend money to fight that (Amendment 6 redistricting) lawsuit."	true	/florida/statements/2011/jul/20/alan-hays/hays-said-he-didnt-vote-spend-money-amendment-6-la/	Florida legislators hit the road beginning in June 2011 for a series of public hearings to collect input about redistricting. The traveling statewide show has drawn many residents who have peppered legislators with questions and criticisms that have put leaders on the defensive. PolitiFact Florida previously evaluated a claim by State Rep. Will Weatherford, chairman of the redistricting committee in the House. While at a hearing in Panama City, the Wesley Chapel Republican said, "There is no $30 million pot of money" for redistricting in the House -- a claim we deemed False. While there is no $30 million pot of money labeled exclusively for redistricting in the House, there are two pots of money which are available to fight redistricting lawsuits. This time we will travel -- that is, electronically because we watched a video of the July 13 hearing -- to The Villages, a mainly conservative retirement community in Central Florida. There, some residents raised questions about public dollars being spent to fight a redistricting state constitutional amendment approved by voters in 2010. One man directed a question to Sen. Alan Hays, a Republican from Umatilla, north of Orlando. "Some of you people had voted to tax or to spend our taxes against the amendments that were passed by 63 percent of the vote," the man said. "I wonder if you, Sen. Hays, since I'm in your district, did you vote?" "Did I vote for what?" Hays asked. "... These taxes being paid for the suit against the amendments?" the man asked. The man was referring to a lawsuit, initially filed by two of Florida's minority members of Congress -- Democrat Corrine Brown and Republican Mario Diaz-Balart -- seeking to overturn Amendment 6, which relates to congressional redistricting. The Florida House later joined that lawsuit as an intervenor plaintiff. Later in the meeting, Hays responded: "No I did not vote to spend money to fight that lawsuit. The disappointing part of this whole thing, folks, is the misinformation that is out there. The Florida Legislature has not filed a lawsuit to fight Amendments 5 and 6. The Amendment 6 lawsuit was filed by one Republican congressman and one Democratic congresswoman. The Florida House chose to go, and what's the term? An intervenor? ... in seeking clarification. The Florida House intervened. But your tax dollars are not being used to sue you, the people who voted the 63 percent. Believe me. I don't know where you got your information but it's incorrect. So no I did not vote to waste that money." When we hear a politician declare that there is misinformation lurking about our ears perk up. In three separate items, we will dissect three claims by Hays: • "No I did not vote to spend money to fight that lawsuit" -- referring to a lawsuit challenging Amendment 6. • "The Florida Legislature has not filed a lawsuit to fight Amendments 5 and 6." • "Your tax dollars are not being used to sue you the people who voted the 63 percent" in favor of Amendment 6. In this item, we'll check Hays' assertion that he did not "vote to spend money to fight that lawsuit." First, some background on redistricting. Every 10 years -- two years after U.S. Census figures are compiled -- state lawmakers redraw state and congressional legislative districts. The objective is to adjust district sizes to reflect changes in the population. The task seems simple enough: to logically divide Florida's 18.8 million residents into 120 House districts, 40 Senate districts and 27 congressional districts. But the process is never without accusations of "gerrymandering" often brought up against the party in power. This round of redistricting, however, figures to be even more contentious because of two constitutional amendments -- 5 and 6 -- approved by voters in November 2010 that require districts to be drawn in a way that doesn't favor incumbents or political parties or interfere with minority representation. Some lawmakers say the amendments are vaguely worded and are open to interpretation, meaning that any redrawing of district lines will be open to a legal challenge. Amendment 5 covers state legislative districts. Amendment 6 imposes the same requirements for drawing congressional maps. As we mentioned, two members of Florida's congressional delegation -- Democrat Corrine Brown and Republican Mario Diaz-Balart -- are challenging Amendment 6, arguing that they believe the changes will reverse gains in minority representation. Hispanics represent more than half of the voting-age population in Diaz-Balart's district while African-Americans represent nearly half in Brown's district, according to their federal court complaint. Brown and Diaz-Balart filed their lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Southern Florida on Nov. 3, 2010, arguing that Florida voters can't change the standards for congressional district-drawing because the issue is governed by the U.S. Constitution, not the Florida Constitution. The Florida Secretary of State is defending the lawsuit, and several other entities or individuals have joined as defendants including the American Civil Liberties Union and the Florida State Conference of NAACP branches as well as a handful of Democratic state legislators. In their May 25 motion seeking to dismiss the suit, the defendants argued that the plaintiffs were asking the court to "nullify the people's decision to require that the Legislature take a fair and balanced approach when drawing Congressional districts. And their motivation is obvious: they are incumbents and they are threatened by the fact that, for the first time ever, there are fair and neutral standards prohibiting the favoring or disfavoring of particular incumbents or parties." (Kurt Browning, the Secretary of State, opposed the amendments.) Oral arguments have been set for July 29 in Miami. On Jan. 14, 2011, the Florida House filed a motion seeking to join the Brown/Diaz-Balart lawsuit which was ultimately granted. The state Senate, however, did not join the lawsuit. We'll talk a little more about the distinction in examining another part of Hays' statement, but for this fact-check, it makes things quite clear. Because the Senate did not join the lawsuit, there clearly wasn't any vote that Hays could have participated in to set aside money to fight that lawsuit. The Senate has money set aside that it could possibly use for redistricting -- including legal fees. But that money won't go toward the Amendment 6 lawsuit. And even more generally, there wasn't a vote on budgeting redistricting legal fees in the Senate, both Craig Meyer, chief of staff for Republican Senate President Mike Haridopolos, and Sen. Nan Rich, the Senate's Democratic leader, told us. Instead, the redistricting dollars go into an overall category that the Senate leadership can spend how it sees fit. So, Hays was correct to say "I did not vote to spend money to fight that lawsuit." There was no vote for line-item money for the lawsuit initially filed by the members of Congress and now also being fought by the state House -- but not the state Senate. We rate this claim True.

pomt-04231	"We’ve outdrawn the Super Bowl for a little while now in the arenas and stadiums that we’ve followed them in for the Super Bowl. We’ve gone in after [the NFL] and surpassed their ticket sales."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/nov/22/paul-levesque/jersey-itinerary-both-events-wrestler-triple-h-say/	Guess what, sports fans? The Super Bowl may not be the biggest ticket in town after all, according to popular wrestling entertainer Triple H. That designation might instead go to WrestleMania, an annual one-night event featuring matches between some of the most popular wrestlers within World Wrestling Entertainment. And MetLife Stadium is likely to become the show ring for that title when WrestleMania comes to town in April and the real Super Bowl follows in February 2014. "We’ve outdrawn the Super Bowl for a little while now in the arenas and stadiums that we’ve followed them in for the Super Bowl," Paul Levesque (Triple H’s real moniker) said in a Nov. 8 interview on NYPost.com. "We’ve gone in after [the NFL] and surpassed their ticket sales." Levesque is executive vice president for Talent Relations and Live Events for the Stamford, Conn.-based WWE. In the context of attendance, Levesque wins this bout. PolitiFact New Jersey can’t predict the ticket sales outcome for both events at MetLife Stadium, so we looked at six stadiums where WrestleMania was held after a Super Bowl. In five of the six arenas (Pontiac Silverdome, Ford Field, Reliant Stadium, University of Phoenix Stadium and Sun Life Stadium), WrestleMania attendance topped Super Bowl attendance. Here’s a breakdown by arena: STADIUM SUPER BOWL YEAR WRESTLEMANIA YEAR Pontiac Silverdome 81,270 1982 93,173 1987 Ford Field 68,206 2006 80,103 2007 Reliant Stadium 71,525 2004 72,744 2009 U. Phoenix Stadium 71,101 2008 72,219 2010 Georgia Dome 72,625 2000 71,617 2011 Sun Life Stadium 74,059 2010 78,363 2012 Sources: World Wrestling Entertainment, NFL’s Super Bowl XLVI 2011 Postseason Media Guide So why has WrestleMania had better ticket sales than the Super Bowl? Staging. Seats can be added to the field for Wrestlemania events, but not for Super Bowls, possibly giving WrestleMania a capacity advantage. "The difference between WrestleMania and Super Bowl staging is that WrestleMania has a stage much like a concert so seats behind the stage are unavailable but would be used for football," Kevin Hennessy, WWE senior director of publicity, said in an e-mail. "However, for WrestleMania, seats are added to field level which would not be done for football. That is why we feel justified in making the comparison." That was the case at Glendale, Ariz.’s University of Phoenix Stadium, where temporary seats were added for WrestleMania in 2010, spokesman Scott Norton said. And New Jerseyans have a reason to care about ticket sales when both events come to MetLife Stadium: ticket sales equal economic impact. "According to the NY/NJ Super Bowls Host Committee (headed by CEO Al Kelly) approximately 150,000 out-of-town visitors will attend non-game events and that the region will have approximately 400,000 people total who will attend events related to Super Bowl activities that are not the actual Super Bowl game," Wayne Hasenbalg, president and CEO of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, said in an e-mail. "According to a SMRI (Sports Management Research Institute) economic study, the recent Super Bowl in Indianapolis (XLVI) had a $155 million economic impact on the central Indiana region," Hasenbalg continued. "The SMRI estimates $550 million in regional economic impact for our Super Bowl (XLVIII)." The SMRI did not return a call for comment. WrestleMania 28’s economic impact on Miami this past April totaled $103 million, according to a report assessing the event’s financial impact on that city. Our ruling WWE executive Paul Levesque, better known by his stage name Triple H, said in a recent interview that "we’ve outdrawn the Super Bowl for a little while now in the arenas and stadiums that we’ve followed them in for the Super Bowl. We’ve gone in after [the NFL] and surpassed their ticket sales." In terms of attendance, Levesque is largely correct: WrestleMania sold more tickets than the Super Bowl in five of the six stadiums where WrestleMania was held after a Super Bowl. It's worth noting, however, that since WrestleMania's staging is similar to a concert's, field seating may be added to compensate for lost seating behind the WrestleMania stage.

pomt-05043	President Barack Obama’s health care reform "slashed $500 billion from Medicare."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jul/11/sean-duffy/wisconsin-gop-us-rep-sean-duffy-says-obamacare-law/	On June 6, 2012, Wisconsin Democrat Pat Kreitlow huffed and puffed in declaring that U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis., "voted twice to end Medicare." It was a claim, made numerous times about others, that PolitiFact National labeled its Lie of the Year for 2011. Kreitlow, who is challenging Duffy in the November 2012 election, earned a Pants on Fire for his version. A day later, Duffy fumed over Kreitlow’s support of President Barack Obama’s health care reform law, saying it "slashed $500 billion from Medicare." That has been another popular claim for the Truth-O-Meter. Let’s see whether Duffy is spouting anything more than hot air. Past claims The first phases of the health care reform law, which was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in June 2012, took effect in March 2010. Six months later, the 60 Plus Association, a conservative advocacy group for senior citizens, began running TV ads against Democratic members of Congress from Wisconsin and other states who voted for it. The claim? The law "will cut $500 billion from Medicare" and "hurt the quality" of care for seniors. PolitiFact National found the law does not take $500 billion out of the current Medicare budget, but reduces the growth of Medicare spending by just over $500 billion over 10 years. In rating the claim Mostly False, our colleagues noted that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects Medicare spending will rise to $929 billion in 2020, an increase of $430 million over actual spending in 2009. So, Medicare spending continues to increase, but not by as much as it would have without the reform law. The claims of a $500 billion cut to Medicare, however, have continued. In May 2012, a Republican Ohio congressman accused a Democratic Ohio congresswoman of having "gutted Medicare by $500 billion" by voting for the health care reform law. PolitiFact Ohio rated the claim Mostly False, noting that Medicare spending would have grown at a faster rate without the law. The same month, PolitiFact Florida gave a Mostly False to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce for saying "seniors will see $500 billion in Medicare cuts to fund ‘Obamacare.’" Our colleagues found that slowing the growth in Medicare spending is intended to offset, to some extent, the overall cost of the law. (For a comprehensive look at Medicare and claims made about it, read "The PolitiFact guide to Medicare attack lines.") Duffy claim Duffy's made his claim in a news release issued June 7, 2012 to criticize Kreitlow's support of the health care reform law. Regarding the law's effect on Medicare, Duffy said: "Kreitlow's full-throated support for the government’s unwarranted takeover of healthcare slashed $500 billion from Medicare, too." (Claims that Obama's law is a government takeover of health care was PolitiFact National's Lie of the Year for 2010.) Duffy campaign manager Justin Richards argued that "slashed" is an accurate way of describing how the law reduces the growth in Medicare spending. But even though some of the news article excerpts Richards cited referred to cuts, he acknowledged that the reductions are in the growth of future spending. Our rating Duffy said the federal health care reform law "slashed $500 billion from Medicare." There is an element of truth in his statement because Medicare spending will grow by about $500 billion less than it would have without the law. But the law has not already reduced Medicare spending by $500 billion, as Duffy suggests. We rate Duffy's statement Mostly False.

pomt-13201	The city of Richmond "built the second richest team in the NFL a $14 million stadium."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2016/oct/24/joe-morrissey/joe-morrissey-hits-and-misses-claim-about-redskin-/	Joe Morrissey says Richmond fumbled in 2013 when it signed a long-term deal to bring the Washington Redskins’ summer training camp to the city. "We built the second richest team in the NFL a $14 million stadium," Morrissey said during an Oct. 17 mayoral candidates debate sponsored by ChamberRVA. There’s been been lots of arguing over whether the Redskins training facility - located behind the Science Museum of Virginia - has been good for the city. Boosters of the plan, including outgoing Mayor Dwight Jones, have said it was a way to bring in economic activity in the city; detractors say the deal was a give away city dollars. We won’t be able to settle that debate, but we’re curious about the factual claims in Morrissey’s statement: That the Redskins are the "second richest team" in the NFL and that the city built them a "$14 million stadium." Let’s start by saying Morrissey’s description of the training camp as a stadium is inaccurate. The facility has no structure with tiered seats surrounding a field. What the city built is essentially a two-story building and two football fields on a 17-acre tract. The first floor has a locker room and training rooms that the Redskins use during their three-week summer camp. When the team leaves town, the first floor is leased by Bon Secours hospital system as a men’s health center. Richmond planned to lease the second floor as office space, but has been unable to find tenants. The $14 million Morrissey said his figure on the cost to build the training facility was derived from two sources -- the city’s $10 million investment in the training camp as well as a $4 million state grant that Virginia provided to the Redskins. The state grant didn’t pay for constructing the facility; it was tied to an agreement between the state to encourage the Redskins, who are headquartered in Ashburn, to retain and expand their operations in Virginia. The cost to build the training camp wasn’t $14 million. It was $10 million, paid for by the city and built by Richmond’s Economic Development Agency, said Tammy Hawley, a spokeswoman for Mayor Jones. She added in an email that the EDA also paid for an additional $1 million to build a park at the site. Rent and naming rights are being used to make bond payments for the city’s investment, she said. But the city is also responsible for $500,000 payments to the Redskins each year during the course of the eight-year-agreement to cover some the team’s costs of training in Richmond. That’s paid for through sponsorships, in-kind services and not additional city funding, says a July 21, 2016 report to the City Council that Hawley sent us. In recent years, the city’s EDA has had to make payments to cover portions of the annual $500,000 bill because sponsorships and other revenues from the site haven’t met expectations. The second richest NFL team? This isn’t the first time Morrissey has said the Redskins are the "second richest team in the NFL." He also did so during a Sept. 29 interview on The John Fredericks show. Morrissey pointed us to an Associated Press article from August 2014 and an April 2016 posting on sports news website that say the Redskins team was the third most valuable team in the NFL. The NFL value rankings are done every year by Forbes magazine, which looks at each team’s overall value as well as how much annual revenue they generate. They have shown that, for years, the Redskins have been in the top tier the most valuable football franchises. Forbes valued the team at $1.7 billion in 2013, $2.4 billion in 2014 and $2.85 billion in 2015. Each year that made them the third most valuable franchise among the NFL’s 32 teams. The Redskins’ annual revenue was $381 million in 2012, $395 million in 2013 and $439 million in 2014, Forbes reported. The 2016 estimates came out last month, and they show Washington has slipped in the rankings even though its value continues to increase. The Dallas Cowboys and New England Patriots continue to dominate as the most valuable teams. But the New York giants and San Francisco 49ers, which are valued at $3.1 billion and $3 billion, respectively, have now barely pulled ahead of the Redskins in the rankings. Washington’s $2.95 billion overall value this year, ranks it fifth.The Redskins’ revenues of $447 million last year still ranked third, barely ahead of the Giants and the 49ers. Our ruling Morrissey said "We built the second richest team in the NFL a $14 million stadium." Morrissey’s gist - that Richmond spent a lot of money building a training facility for one of the richest teams in the NFL - is solid. But his statement is filled with exaggerated figures and terms. The facility is not a stadium; it mainly consists of two practice fields and a building containing a locker room and training rooms. The construction cost was $10 million. And the Redskins are the fifth wealthiest team in the NFL, according to Forbes. On the whole, we rate Morrissey’s multi-faceted statement Half True.

pomt-12007	"Thomas Jefferson said, ‘Government that governs least governs best.’ "	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/sep/21/mike-pence/mike-pence-erroneously-credits-thomas-jefferson-sm/	Vice President Mike Pence defended the diminished role of Washington in the latest health care bill introduced in the Senate by citing ardent anti-Federalist Thomas Jefferson. Pence appeared on Fox & Friends on Sept. 21, 2017, to address criticism of the proposal to dismantle the Affordable Care Act by U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana. Co-host Ainsley Earhardt asked Pence whether proposed block grants to states would mean governors would cover pre-existing conditions. Pence sidestepped the question by suggesting local control is better than a strong central government, a point of view the third president may have endorsed. "Thomas Jefferson said, ‘Government that governs least governs best,’ " Pence said. "I mean, the question that people ought to ask is, who do you think will be more responsive to the healthcare needs in your community? Your governor and your state legislature, or a congressman and a president in a far off nation’s capital?" It must be nice to have Jefferson on your side — except Jefferson didn’t say it. "This comes up a lot," said Annette Gordon-Reed, a Harvard legal history professor who has written extensively about Jefferson. She pointed out that the quote is so often misattributed to him that the Thomas Jefferson Foundation at Monticello in Virginia even has a web page devoted to addressing it. For years, the quote was attributed to Henry David Thoreau, who evoked the motto "That government is best which governs least," in his 1849 essay Civil Disobedience. Thoreau argued that individuals should not let governments make them agents of injustice. Historians now generally accept that Thoreau was likely quoting the United States Magazine and Democratic Review, which printed in 1837 that "The best government is that which governs least." By 1853, credit for the sentiment passed to Jefferson, who was not necessarily a fan of strong central governments. "Although the ideas expressed in this quotation may be in line with Jefferson's opinions to some extent, the exact phrasing is almost certainly not Jefferson's," foundation research librarian Anna Berkes wrote on the page. "However, this quotation has been associated with the ideological descendants of Jefferson's Democratic-Republican party for a very long time, and this is likely why it ultimately came to be attributed to him." Berkes previously told PolitiFact that the rampant misattribution to Jefferson led her to create the "Spurious Quotations" page on the Monticello website. (It seems Thomas Jefferson survives through plenty more false quotes than just this one advocating for small government.) "The opinion has been associated with Jefferson’s Democratic-Republican party ideology, which is probably why people think he said it," she said. "The association is what has been called a natural Jeffersonian maxim. It’s just not a Jefferson quote." Pence repeated a saying often associated with Jefferson, but research showed the writer of the Declaration of Independence never said it. We rate this statement False.

Tina Smith, D-Minn., tweeted out her support for an end to differential pay for men and women. Her tweet said, "It’s completely unacceptable that, on average, American women only earn 80 cents for every dollar a man earns for doing the same job. And the #paygap is even greater for most women of color. #EqualPayDay" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com But there’s a problem: The statistics showing that women earn 80 percent of what men earn are overall comparisons and do not specifically compare men and women occupying the same jobs. After we reached out to Smith’s office, she sent a new tweet to correct her earlier misstatement. Let’s take a closer look at this commonly cited statistic. The most recent official data on this point, published by the U.S. Census Bureau, showed that women earned 80.5 percent of what men did. That’s up by a couple percentage points in recent years. However, as we’ve written previously, this figure actually refers to the general disparity between what men and women earn, not comparing cases of apples to apples. The 80 percent figure does not adjust for such factors as the degrees and jobs women pursue, the time they take off to care for children, the number of hours they work, and the years of experience they’ve had. So while the 80 percent figure may be used to signify some facets of women’s challenges in the workplace -- such as disproportionate representation in fields that offer more flexible work schedules, even if that means earning less -- the statistic cannot be used to pinpoint pay discrimination between men and women doing the same work. Other studies have shown a significantly closer match for men and women holding the same jobs. For instance, a 2013 study by the American Association of University Women that evened out those factors found a 7 percent wage gap between men and women a year after graduating college. That’s still a disparity, but it’s only about one-third as big as the figure Smith cited in her tweet. (It’s also worth noting that the apples-to-apples pay differential varies depending on the job.) Smith did have a point that women of color tend to fare more poorly on pay comparisons than do white women. A 2014 report from the National Women’s Law Center concluded that black women made 60 cents to the dollar earned by a white man, and Hispanic women made 55 cents, according to the report. Asian-American women actually earn higher wages than black and Hispanic men and women, as well as white women, Pew Research has found. Still, Asian-American women lagged behind white males for annual earnings. A few hours after we contacted Smith’s office, they informed us that Smith had sent a new tweet correcting her previous one. In the new tweet, she removed the reference to "the same job" and continued: "When I wrote about Equal Pay Day earlier this week, I said the 80 cents/$1 stat applies to men and women doing the same job. That last part—comparing particular job categories—wasn’t quite right. And I’m glad @PolitiFact reached out to me for clarification." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling In Smith’s initial tweet, she wrote, "On average, American women only earn 80 cents for every dollar a man earns for doing the same job." The official federal data shows that women earn 80 percent of what men earn, but that’s a collective average for all jobs, not a comparison of men and women holding identical jobs. For men and women holding the same job, there’s still a gap, but it’s substantially smaller. Our policy is to acknowledge and applaud after-the-fact corrections by speakers we check, but we still put the original comment to the Truth-O-Meter. So Smith’s initial remark rates Mostly False.

pomt-10664	Romney refused to pardon "a decorated soldier" returning from Iraq who had been charged with a crime involving a BB gun when he was 13.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/28/mike-huckabee/romney-refused-to-pardon-soldier-and-everyo/	In response to a TV ad by Mitt Romney that highlights Mike Huckabee's 1,000-plus pardons, Huckabee tried to turn the tables and said Romney's refusal to grant pardons denied people who committed small crimes a chance to clear their records. Huckabee cited one case involving "a decorated soldier" who wanted to become a police officer but still had a criminal record from a minor incident when he was 13 years old and shot another boy with a BB gun. "Didn't even break the skin," Huckabee said on NBC's Today Show on Dec. 19. Huckabee is accurately describing the case of a soldier named Anthony Circosta of Agawam, Mass., a member of the Army National Guard who fought in Iraq and was awarded a Bronze Star. He then sought a pardon so he could become a police officer, but was turned down. Circosta did not return a phone call from PolitiFact this week, but Huckabee's description of the case is supported by accounts in the Associated Press and other publications. "Now, I would have given that kid a pardon," Huckabee said about Circosta in a Fox News Channel interview on Dec. 20. "And everywhere I've gone and asked people for a show of hands, everybody agrees with me." Romney refused all pardon requests in his four years as governor. "I didn't pardon anybody as governor because I didn't want to overturn a jury," he said during a June 2007 debate. When he was asked about his policy in December 2007, Romney replied "We looked at the cases one by one and I did not want to provide commutations to people who had weapons violations that were going to be asking to use weapons in their new capacity." He told reporters that the only reasons he would have issued a pardon or commutation would have been if he found evidence that proved a wrongful conviction, prosecutorial misconduct or errors in the judicial process.

pomt-14916	"It has been estimated that nearly 40 percent of all guns sold in America are sold by private, unlicensed sellers either online or through gun shows."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2015/nov/02/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-says-40-percent-gun-sales-escape-backgro/	Gov. Terry McAuliffe recently issued an executive order that banned firearms from most state buildings and offered his rationale for a gun control measure he plans to present to the General Assembly this winter. McAuliffe, a Democrat, is calling for a law that would require all prospective gun buyers in Virginia to undergo a background check to determine whether the purchaser has a disqualifying criminal record or mental health history. Although the governor long has supported this action, his intensity grew after the Aug. 26 fatal shootings of Roanoke television reporter Alison Parker and cameraman Adam Ward near Smith Mountain Lake. Virginia law now requires all licensed gun dealers - those in the business of selling arms - to conduct computerized checks on buyers. But sales between individuals are exempt and that, McAuliffe says, opens a loophole for guns to fall into the wrong hands. A federal law requiring background checks has the same exemption. "It has been estimated that nearly 40 percent of all guns sold in America are sold by private, unlicensed sellers either online or through guns shows," McAuliffe stated in his Oct. 15 executive order. Christina Nuckols, deputy press secretary for McAuliffe, said the source of the 40 percent figure is a 1997 study by the National Institute of Justice that looked at gun owners’ responses to a 1994 national survey asking how they got their weapons. The study found that 30 percent to 40 percent of all gun transactions were made through an "off-the-books" transfer in which a background check wasn’t required. The finding has been cited widely by gun control advocates - including Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D- Va. - in calling for a federal law mandating universal background checks. But as we and other fact checkers have noted previously, the research is old and limited. Consider: •The 1994 survey was conducted eight months after the federal Brady Act went into effect, mandating background checks on individuals seeking to buy firearms from federally licensed dealers. Survey participants were asked about their gun acquisitions going back to 1991. •Only 251 gun owners answered the survey question about the origin of their weapons. Some of the gun owners weren’t sure how they’d gotten their guns and answered "probably" or "probably not" to whether they got the gun from a licensed firearm dealer. McAuliffe’s statement misses a key distinction in the study: The research looked at all gun transactions - including when a gun was obtained as a gift or as an inheritance - and not just being "sold," as the governor said. The Fact Checker at The Washington Post in 2013 asked one of the co-authors of the study, Jens Ludwig of the University of Chicago, to crunch the 1994 data just looking at sales. Ludwig replied that 14 percent to 22 percent of guns were purchased without a background check. The 1994 data, we also should note, did not have a category for online sales, as McAuliffe’s statement suggests. Earlier this year, we asked the other co-author of the report, Philip Cook of Duke University, what percentage of guns currently are sold without a background check. In response, he sent us an op-ed that he and Ludwig wrote in the National Review after the December 2012 shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. - a time when the 40 percent figure was circulating again. "We’ve been following the give-and-take with some interest because our research is the original source of the 40-percent statistic," they wrote. "Our views may come as a surprise: First, we don’t know the current percentage - nor does anyone else." The lack of current data is due largely because federal funding for gun studies dried up two decades ago. President Barack Obama issued a memorandum in 2013 directing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to re-examine gun violence. We also should note that Virginia doesn’t keep data about private guns, said Corinne Geller, communications manager for the state police. As a result, we recently gave a False rating to a statement by state Sen. Tommy Norment, R-James City, that only 2 percent of Virginia gun sales are exempt from background checks. The fact is, nobody knows. Our ruling McAuliffe said, "It has been estimated that nearly 40 percent of all guns sold in America are sold by private, unlicensed sellers either online or through gun shows." His source is a small-sample survey from 1994 that included firearms that were sold and those that were given as gifts or inheritances. When the results were adjusted to guns sold - the term McAuliffe uses - only 14 percent to 22 percent of the firearms were sold without background checks. The researchers say they "don’t know" if their findings are relevant today. No current national study has been published. McAuliffe did not acknowledge these points, all of which have been reported widely. So we rate his statement Mostly False.

pomt-14071	Says "Jacky Rosen has refused to tell us whether she supports Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton."	pants on fire!	/nevada/statements/2016/may/20/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-wrongly-says-jacky-rosen-refused-say-if-she-s/	Republicans are hoping to tie the increasingly fraught battle between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders for the Democratic presidential nomination to down-ballot Democrats. That’s the case in Nevada, where the National Republican Congressional Committee is running automated telephone calls telling voters that Democratic candidate Jacky Rosen hasn’t committed to supporting either Sanders or Clinton. "Jacky Rosen has refused to tell us whether she supports Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton," the recorded call says. So has Rosen, a synagogue leader who was recruited by Sen. Harry Reid to run for the state’s 3rd Congressional District, refused to weigh in on the presidential race? In a word — no. Rosen, who announced her candidacy in January, told Nevada political reporter Jon Ralston on May 12 that she caucused for Clinton back in February. "I caucused for Hillary, and it looks like she’s going to be the nominee, and I’m proud to stand on the ticket with her," she told Ralston. (This comment starts at 20:30.) NRCC spokesman Zach Hunter said in an email that there was a difference between caucusing and endorsing, and that Rosen has generally been dodgy on the issue. "In 2016 when you have such a divide in the Democratic party as it barrels towards a contested convention, the difference is significant," he said in an email. It’s true that Rosen has done few media interviews since announcing her candidacy, but it doesn’t appear that she’s really been asked about who she’s endorsed for president. Articles in the Laughlin Nevada Times and Las Vegas Sun don’t mention a presidential endorsement from Rosen. Associated Press political reporter Michelle Rindels interviewed Rosen on April 27 for an upcoming story and confirmed that the candidate openly supported Clinton. It is curious as to why Rosen didn’t speak up about her presidential preference before Nevada’s presidential caucus in February, despite announcing her candidacy back in January. The Clinton campaign in the state didn’t appear to tout her endorsement, and she doesn’t appear on a campaign list of "100 Nevada women for Hillary" from November 2015. But her endorsement of Clinton on Ralston Live was straightforward. "She spent eight years in the White House, she was a senator, she’s traveled all around the world talking to world leaders," she said. "And she’s a mom and a grandma and I really think she has a lifelong experience in doing this, having a calm, cool, collected head, being analytical and those are the kind of things that are important to me." Our ruling The NRCC says Democrat Jacky Rosen "has refused to tell us whether she supports Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton." PolitiFact was unable to find an instance where Rosen refused to answer questions about her presidential preference. Rosen has said on at least two occasions, one publicly and one to a reporter, that she supports Hillary Clinton.

pomt-12075	"It is shocking to me that Police Commissioner Richard Ross and Mayor Jim Kenney allowed this illegal occupation to go on for hours without taking any action to enforce the law…"	false	/pennsylvania/statements/2017/sep/01/martina-white/why-black-lives-matter-protest-outside-philly-poli/	Since Black Lives Matter protesters rallied last week outside the home of the Philadelphia Police officer who shot and killed David Jones, several politicians and local leaders have jumped in to defend the officer and condemn BLM’s actions. Among the strongest voices speaking out against the Black Lives Matter protesters has been Pa. Rep. Martina White. She gave a statement to the Northeast Times this week saying, "It is shocking to me that Police Commissioner Richard Ross and Mayor Jim Kenney allowed this illegal occupation to go on for hours without taking any action to enforce the law, and I question whether the police department has been ordered to stand down when it comes to addressing this Black Lives Matter action." We zeroed in on the phrase "illegal occupation." Did the BLM protesters, who did not have a permit, commit an illegal act outside officer Ryan Pownall’s home? Asked why White believed the protesters were illegally occupying the area, spokesperson David Foster told PolitiFact PA it was because they lacked a permit and harassed the neighbors. He also offered up the same statement given to the Northeast Times. The protesters kept video of the rally, found on leader Asa Khalif’s public Facebook page. In it, you can see 30 minutes of footage during which a handful of protesters walk back and forth between the street and sidewalks, shouting anti-police remarks on a bullhorn. Throughout the protest, the street and sidewalks mostly remain clear. The protesters did not at any point band together in an attempt to block traffic. However, a police vehicle was parked in the middle of the street for some time. ACLU PA deputy legal director Mary Catherine Roper said Black Lives Matter did nothing illegal. Philadelphia requires permits for demonstrations of 75 people or more and for protests that occur on city streets or sidewalks "without compliance with the normal and customary traffic regulations or controls governing such places." Roper said the protest outside of Pownall’s home was too small to require a permit and didn’t clash with the other required criterion, given the protesters weren’t preventing others from using the sidewalks or the street. "The representative needs to brush up on the law if she’s going to make comments like that," Roper said, "which are simply not accurate." Lauren Hitt, communications director for Mayor Jim Kenney, said a protest of this size did not need to apply for a permit. Some court cases have restricted the rights of protesters in residential areas, such as Klebanoff v. McMonagle in 1988 in the Pennsylvania Superior Court. The judges upheld an injunction against dozens of pro-life protesters who had repeatedly rallied in front of an abortion doctor’s home. But the decision didn’t outwardly ban protesting in residential areas. Roper said the BLM protesters were within their rights given their size and the way they walked around the streets and sidewalks rather than camping out directly in front of Pownall’s home. The 7th District police, which preside over the Bustleton neighborhood where Pownall lives, did not respond to a request for comment. Neither did BLM’s Khalif. Our ruling White said protesters rallying outside the home of Pownall, who shot and killed Jones, were engaged in an "illegal occupation." The protesters, which numbered no more than 10, had not applied for a permit. But Philadelphia doesn’t require demonstrations featuring less than 75 people to apply for permits. The protesters were also not blocking the streets or the sidewalks of the neighborhood, actions that would also call for a permit. We rule the claim False.

pomt-05711	"Today, you can't rely on (the retirement fund for public employees), it's not funded."	false	/florida/statements/2012/mar/07/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-state-pension-fund-not-funded/	Gov. Rick Scott made no secret of his distaste for a judge’s decision to overturn a 3 percent cut in state workers’ salaries on March 6, 2012. Lawmakers in 2011 touted the cut as necessary; they said they were diverting the money to shore up the $124 billion pension fund for state and local employees. The change saved the state $1 billion and local governments $600 million, reported the Tampa Bay Times and the Miami Herald. Circuit Judge Jackie Fulford’s decision throws that plan into chaos. She ruled the pay cut an unconstitutional breach of the state's contract with employees and ordered the money returned with interest. Fulford noted in her order that the 3-percent salary reduction did not actually go toward the retirement fund; legislators used it to balance the budget and left $1.2 billion unspent. Her decision didn't sit well with Scott. "This is an example of a judge wanting to write the law. We all know that this is constitutional, there's no question about it," Scott told reporters. "I want to make sure we fix the plan so individuals can actually rely on it. Because today, you can't rely on that plan, it's not funded," he said. "So it's going to have a big impact on our counties, it has a big impact on our state budget. But it's clearly constitutional." We’ve heard alarming things about Florida’s pension fund over the years, but never that it is flatly not funded. PolitiFact Florida wanted to set the record straight on how the Florida Retirement System works. The truth is that Florida’s pension fund is funded. Is it fully funded? No, but that’s not typical for most state pension funds. The most recent data shows the pension’s worth versus what it owes in benefits is 87.5 percent, as of June 30, 2011. So if everyone in the pension system retired at once, there would not be enough money in the retirement system to pay their full benefits. Still, 87 percent isn’t bad compared to most states. The average level is 77 percent. "87 (percent) is a strong funding level, particularly given the difficult financial market over recent years," said Keith Brainard, research director of the National Association of State Retirement Administrators. Scott spokesman Lane Wright said we were nit-picking the governor’s statement and that he obviously just misspoke. Wright pointed us to past stories on the pension from our site and the Tampa Bay Times, where Scott correctly asserts the retirement system is underfunded. What’s more, Wright said, is that Scott’s office for a few months has been occupied by a big chart comparing the pension fund’s liabilities, assets and payments. His graphic correctly shows the plan as funded at 87.5 percent for fiscal year 2010-11. It also shows how that liability has grown since 2007-08. "He’s had that chart there since at least the beginning of January," Wright said. Not long before storing a daily reminder of the liability gap in his office, Scott attempted to address it in his 2011-12 budget proposal. He called for $300 million to go into the retirement system, including an additional $120 million to address the liability on top of fully funding the normal annual contribution. In his response to the judge’s ruling, though, Scott’s warning was stark, saying "I want to make sure we fix the plan so individuals can actually rely on it. Because today, you can't rely on that plan, it's not funded." That sounds really bad to people who are relying on state benefits. The truth is, it's one of the better funded pension plans in the country. If all public employees retired tomorrow, they still get 87.5 percent of what they were owed. We rate his statement False.

pomt-13553	Says in Washington, D.C., Sen. Richard Burr "took millions from special interests, went there and cashed in, voted to cut (his) own taxes and raise taxes on working folks."	half-true	/north-carolina/statements/2016/aug/25/deborah-ross/attack-ad-hits-sen-richard-burr-votes-cut-taxes-mi/	The first television ad from Senate hopeful Deborah Ross, a North Carolina Democrat challenging Republican Sen. Richard Burr, paints Burr as a self-serving politician. It shows Ross talking on the phone with an actor playing Burr, lounging in a posh office. "You took millions from special interests, went there and cashed in, voted to cut your own taxes and raise taxes on working folks," Ross tells the fictional Burr in the ad. A press release announcing the ad was even more direct: "While Burr’s own wealth has tripled since he has been in the Senate, he has voted to raise taxes on the middle-class and working families while cutting them for millionaires like himself." The ad’s claim is a mouthful, but it makes some hefty allegations. We wondered if it was true that Burr became a millionaire in Washington then voted to cut taxes for millionaires like himself. And did he also vote to raise taxes on middle class and working families? Burr’s growing wealth The ad says Burr "took millions from special interests, went (to D.C.) and cashed in." That’s a bit misleading, since special interests can’t give directly to politicians. That’s called bribery, and there’s no evidence Burr has taken bribes. But his campaigns have received millions from special interests. When Burr first ran for Senate in 2004, he received the most PAC contributions of any Senate candidate, according to a News & Observer report. This year, not much has changed. Burr’s campaign is the No. 1 recipient of contributions from the tobacco and pharmaceutical industries, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Through June 30, 82 percent of the $8.7 million he has raised came from political action committees or large individual donors. By comparison, 74 percent of the $3.9 million Ross raised has come from PACs and large donors. Burr’s successful campaigning gives him a congressional salary of $174,000. That salary – plus investments in real estate and the stock market – helped Burr become a millionaire during his two decades in the House and Senate. He served in the House from 1995 to 2005, and in the Senate since 2005. In that time he has made about $3.6 million in pre-tax salary. We don’t know exactly how much he’s worth because of the rules about what liabilities and assets members of Congress do and don’t have to report. Roll Call, which compiles an annual ranking of members of Congress by minimum possible wealth, said Burr was worth a minimum of $1.6 million last year, ranked 44th in the Senate and 152nd overall. He was worth about $500,000 in 2004, when he first ran for Senate, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Taxes on the wealthy Ross’ claim about Burr’s record on taxes is nearly identical to a claim made in a 2012 Wisconsin Senate race that PolitiFact rated Half True. Four years have passed, though, and we were curious if there was any new information. Both that previous claim and Ross’ ad cited votes cast in 2011 and 2012 in support of Rep. Paul Ryan’s budget proposals. Neither budget passed. But Ross spokesman Austin Vevurka said the ad specifically talked about what Burr voted to do, not what he has done. And the ad is correct that Burr did vote to cut taxes on wealthy people like himself. Ryan’s plans both years would’ve lowered the tax rates of all the highest income brackets, including Burr’s. Not counting his stocks, in 2012 Burr made $174,000 in Senate salary and owned real estate that brought in income somewhere between $115,002 and $1,050,000, according to his financial disclosure forms. His taxes would’ve dropped substantially had the budget passed, as it would’ve created just two income tax brackets: 10 and 25 percent. The income tax system, at that time and now, has six brackets and reaches nearly 40 percent at the top. Burr’s votes to help his fellow millionaires haven’t all been unsuccessful. In 2012, he and other Senate Republicans blocked discussion on the so-called Buffett Rule, which would’ve raised taxes on wealthy investors. That wasn’t a vote to cut taxes, but it was a vote to keep them at the same level. Taxes on the middle class The question of whether Burr voted to increase taxes on middle class or working people is trickier. That’s because Ryan’s budgets promised to cut income tax deductions and loopholes – but did not provide many specifics about what would be cut and what would remain, leading to speculation. "Depending on which think tank you ask about the Ryan Budget, you will get a different answer," said Burr’s communications director, Becca Watkins. "This is because the Ryan budget suggested tax simplification, but it did not specify how taxes should exactly be changed." Watkins is right. However, Ryan’s budget was clear that it would’ve kept the low tax rates on capital gains, dividends and other investment wealth. As a result, Peter Orszag, a banking executive and former budget wonk under both Bush and Obama, wrote in 2012 that of what remained to be cut, "most of the other big tax breaks — such as the mortgage interest deduction, state and local tax deductibility, and pension and health tax benefits — help the middle class." That same year, an analysis found that households earning between $50,000 and $100,000 would see their taxes increase by $1,358 annually if Ryan’s budget passed, and upper middle class households making between $100,000 and $200,000 would see an increase of $2,681. However, like anything else analyzing the budget, that report had to rely on speculation. It also was commissioned by a Congressional committee led by Democrats. Ross did cite one piece of evidence the previous Half True claim did not – a 2013 study that found tax reforms that Burr voted for that year (which, yet again, failed) would have possibly raised taxes on middle class families. But again, its numbers were speculative and it was done by a liberal think tank. It also acknowledged there could’ve been ways to avoid increasing taxes on the middle class, such as increasing the deficit. Watkins said Burr didn’t think Ryan’s budgets were "perfect," but he feared budgets proposed by Democrats would’ve led to even higher taxes. "To suggest he supports increasing taxes on the middle class is baseless," she said. Our ruling Ross said Burr "took millions from special interests, went there and cashed in, voted to cut (his) own taxes and raise taxes on working folks." The part about special interest money needs clarification. The part about tax cuts for the wealthy is accurate, but the part about raising taxes on the middle class is purely speculative – it could be right or it could be wrong, and we simply can’t know for sure. The ad’s claims are partially accurate but need additional information, so we rate this claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/da4eedb5-b710-438e-80ce-82fced947a3e	None	Deborah Ross	None	None	None	2016-08-25T17:03:04	2016-08-22	['Washington,_D.C.', 'Richard_Burr']
pomt-12428	"FBI uncovers evidence that 62 million Trump voters are all Russian agents!"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/may/17/blog-posting/fake-story-about-trump-voters-being-russian-agents/	A satirical story that said every American who voted for Donald Trump works for the Russian government appeared to have started as a parody on a neo-Nazi website. "FBI uncovers evidence that 62 million Trump voters are all Russian agents!" read the headline on a May 15, 2017, post on USPoliticsInfo.com. The post was flagged by Facebook users as possibly being fake, as part of the social media site’s efforts to crack down on fake news. The story is full of absurd details that make it obvious it’s a joke. It said that anonymous FBI sources had revealed the 62 million voters were employed by Russian intelligence (Trump garnered more than 62.9 million votes in the presidential election, almost 2.9 million less than Hillary Clinton). The story also said Wikileaks was run by Vladimir Putin and conservative media personality Alex Jones’ real name was Alexi Jonesov. An unnamed FBI agent further said in the article that "it is highly possible that the Russians used a space-beam from a satellite to control their brains from a facility in St. Petersburg, and moved their bodies like puppets to the polls to check the Trump box" during the election. The same story or portions of it also appeared on several other websites. Most of the time, these fake news sites share the story without any attribution at all. But after some digging, we found that the original fake post came from the white supremacist website DailyStormer.com. Dated March 28, 2017, the article carries the fake New York Times byline Yuri Rosenbaum. It falsely cited several real officials like Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin. The story also said Sen. John McCain, R.-Ariz., called for mass arrests and said Trump himself "began screaming in Russian and jumped in a big truck and drove off down the road" when asked about the allegations. We confirmed with DailyStormer.com publisher Andrew Anglin that his site, which occasionally posts satirical stories, was the source of the article. He said it should be obvious the story is not real, no matter where or in what form it appeared. "My readership — and I hope to God the rest of the literate world — is intelligent enough to understand this is a joke," he said via email.

pomt-05957	"In the last 22 months, businesses have created more than 3 million jobs. Last year, they created the most jobs since 2005."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/25/barack-obama/have-private-sector-jobs-grown-22-months-best-annu/	EDITOR’S NOTE: Our original Half True rating was based on an interpretation that Obama was crediting his policies for the jobs increase. But we've concluded that he was not making that linkage as strongly as we initially believed and have decided to change the ruling to Mostly True. The original article is archived here. We also wrote an explanation of our reporting and why we changed the rating here. During his State of the Union address on Jan. 24, 2012, President Barack Obama offered some evidence about the nation’s improving economy. He began by urging listeners to "remember how we got here. Long before the recession, jobs and manufacturing began leaving our shores. Technology made businesses more efficient, but also made some jobs obsolete. Folks at the top saw their incomes rise like never before, but most hardworking Americans struggled with costs that were growing, paychecks that weren’t, and personal debt that kept piling up. "In 2008, the house of cards collapsed," he continued. "We learned that mortgages had been sold to people who couldn’t afford or understand them. Banks had made huge bets and bonuses with other people’s money. Regulators had looked the other way, or didn’t have the authority to stop the bad behavior. "It was wrong. It was irresponsible. And it plunged our economy into a crisis that put millions out of work, saddled us with more debt and left innocent, hard-working Americans holding the bag. In the six months before I took office, we lost nearly four million jobs. And we lost another four million before our policies were in full effect. "Those are the facts. But so are these. In the last 22 months, businesses have created more than three million jobs. Last year, they created the most jobs since 2005. American manufacturers are hiring again, creating jobs for the first time since the late 1990s. Together, we’ve agreed to cut the deficit by more than $2 trillion. And we’ve put in place new rules to hold Wall Street accountable, so a crisis like that never happens again. "The state of our union is getting stronger. And we’ve come too far to turn back now. As long as I’m president, I will work with anyone in this chamber to build on this momentum." We decided to look specifically at Obama’s claim that "in the last 22 months, businesses have created more than three million jobs. Last year, they created the most jobs since 2005." We checked Obama’s claim by using data published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal agency responsible for compiling employment data. We found that the U.S. economy has seen 22 consecutive months of private-sector job growth, beginning in Feb. 2010. During that 22-month period, the number of jobs grew by almost 3.16 million, or about 143,000 per month. We should note that there has also been a job-growth streak for all jobs in the economy -- not just in the private sector -- but this run of positive jobs numbers has been shorter since job losses in the government sector have offset gains in the private sector for much of that time. If you include both private-sector and government jobs, the economy has seen increases in total jobs for 15 straight months, not 22. But since this isn’t what Obama said, we won’t consider this in our ruling. As for whether 2011 was the best job-producing year since 2005, he’s right if you’re counting private-sector jobs, and slightly off if you’re counting all jobs. In 2011, the number of private-sector jobs rose by about 1.83 million (if you count from the January amount to the December amount) or 1.92 million (if you count from December to December). Either way, the increase in 2011 represented the highest one-year total since 2005, when the number of private-sector jobs increased by either 2.22 million or 2.31 million, depending on the time period used. If you use total jobs, the increase in 2011 was the biggest since 2006, not 2005. But here too, that’s not the measure Obama used, so we won’t consider it in our rating. Finally, there's another dimension. In his remarks, Obama described the damage to the economy, including losing millions of jobs "before our policies were in full effect." Then he describes the subsequent job increases. This suggests that he’s taking a degree of credit for the job growth, which runs counter to the reality that no mayor or governor or president deserves all the blame or all the credit for changes in employment. Our ruling Obama is correct on the numbers. By mentioning his policies, he's making a modest linkage that they deserve credit for the improvement when economists say they are just one factor. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-01-25T11:25:49	2012-01-24	['None']
pomt-05963	Says he eliminated an EPA rule that treated spilled milk like it was oil.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/24/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-he-eliminated-epa-rule-treating-/	In making the case for sensible federal regulations, President Barack Obama in his State of the Union address pointed to a rule that he eliminated because it was about as antiquated as a milkmaid. "We got rid of one rule from 40 years ago that could have forced some dairy farmers to spend $10,000 a year proving that they could contain a spill – because milk was somehow classified as an oil," Obama said in the Jan. 24, 2012, speech. Absurd as it may sound, the Environmental Protection Agency has long regulated milk the same way it does petroleum because of milk’s butter fat content. Vegetable oils fall in the same category. According to the EPA’s website, milk has been regulated under the Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure program since 1973, when the Clean Water Act took effect. The law was passed by Congress the preceding year over the veto of President Richard Nixon. The EPA site says "since the SPCC rule became law in 1973, all kinds of oils including petroleum and edible oils (such as animal fats and vegetable oils) have been considered oils. This is because the SPCC rule gets its definition of ‘oil’ from the Clean Water Act." In February 2009, the EPA announced that it intended to exclude milk and dairy farms from the spill rules governing oil products. Here’s what the announcement said: "EPA proposes to exempt milk containers and associated piping and appurtenances from the SPCC requirements provided they are constructed according to the current applicable 3-A Sanitary Standards, and are subject to the current applicable Grade "A" Pasteurized Milk Ordinance," or similar state laws. In simple English, that means large milk storage containers will no longer have to meet the EPA’s oil spill rules, provided storage tanks meet pasteurization laws. The change took effect in April 2011. "EPA determined that this unintended result of the current regulations – which were designed to prevent oil spill damage to inland waters and shorelines – placed unjustifiable burdens on dairy farmers," the agency said in a press release. We’re not addressing Obama’s projection of costs of $10,000 to some farmers, but we note that the EPA estimated that the rule change would save the industry $140 million a year. Our ruling Obama said his administration got rid of a rule that regulated milk in the same manner as oil, as an environmental hazard when spilled. The original regulation had been in effect since 1973, and the EPA under Obama moooooooved it out in April 2011. We rate the claim True.

pomt-15189	"There's not a single, solitary example that" signing the bill to end Glass-Steagall "had anything to do with the financial crash."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/19/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-glass-steagall-had-nothing-do-financi/	Recently, activists have shown up at Hillary Clinton’s campaign events to urge her to bring back Glass-Steagall. What is Glass-Steagall? It’s the Depression-era bank regulation that kept different types of financial institutions separate; then-President Bill Clinton signed legislation reversing it in 1999. Some Glass-Steagall supporters argue that its demise led to the 2007 financial crisis, and some Democrats have put a good amount of effort into restoring it -- such as presidential candidates Martin O’Malley and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. But Hillary Clinton won't pledge to reinstate Glass-Steagall if she becomes president. And Bill Clinton says criticism over the law’s repeal is unfounded. "Look at all the grief I got for signing the bill that ended Glass-Steagall," Bill Clinton said in an interview with Inc. magazine for its September issue. "There's not a single, solitary example that it had anything to do with the financial crash." Given the significant attention on Glass-Steagall among Democrats, we wondered if it’s true that it didn’t have "anything to do with the financial crash." Our research shows the law’s demise was part of a broad deregulatory push that greatly contributed to the financial crisis. But Clinton has a point that a direct line from the 1999 repeal to the market crash in 2007-08 is hard to identify. Too big to fail Congress passed Glass-Steagall in 1933, in the wake of the 1929 stock market crash that led to the Great Depression. The law kept commercial banks (where customers deposit money and take out loans) separate from investment firms (which hold securities and make investments) -- more colloquially, the law separated Main Street from Wall Street. Some experts and lawmakers want to keep these kinds of activities separate, because they’re worried that merging them could put the public’s money at risk. Here’s a simple hypothetical: A bank merges with an investment firm to create a massive company. The investment side makes a huge bet on an investment that fails big time, so the commercial bank side’s money -- money individuals have deposited for safe-keeping -- could be at risk. Because those deposits are federally insured, it might require a government bailout. (Think too-big-to-fail.) Supporters of the law say keeping these activities separate prevents this kind of domino effect. Is this what caused the most recent financial crisis? There’s plenty of room for debate here, given that there isn’t a single what-caused-the-crisis narrative that every economist accepts. It’s safe to say, though, that there is not a prominent group of economists who argue "but for the 1999 repeal of Glass-Steagall, the crisis would not have happened." Lawrence White, an economist at New York University, doesn’t see Glass-Steagall playing any role in the financial crisis whatsoever. He pointed to the crisis’ biggest culprits: firms such as Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, Goldman Sachs and AIG, to name a few. He added that much of the crisis hinged on activity by these institutions that would have been possible with or without Glass-Steagall, such as mass investment in notoriously bad mortgage loans. (Clinton’s staff linked us to commentary by several other experts who share White’s view.) We also contacted Barry Ritholtz, a wealth management expert and commentator, who said Glass-Steagall would have done nothing to stop the financial crisis, but not having it made the crisis worse. It encouraged banks to get bigger and to take on riskier investments, so the ripple effects of the crisis were bigger than they would have been otherwise, he said, adding that it wasn’t just the headline-making banks that struggled. The extent over Glass-Steagall’s effect on the financial crisis is a topic on which reasonable people can disagree. More so in Clinton’s favor is the fact that Glass-Steagall was a shadow of its former self by the time 1999 rolled around. Deregulating like it’s 1999 A few decades out from the Depression, starting in earnest in the 1970s, there was a push to roll back financial regulations that continued throughout the administrations of former presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. As part of that movement, banks and lawmakers steadily chipped away at Glass-Steagall and took advantage of loopholes. Banks were engaging in the kinds of activity Glass-Steagall was intended to stop even though the law was still on the books. By the time Clinton signed the Financial Services Modernization Act, commonly known as Gramm-Leach-Bliley, repealing the key components of Glass-Steagall in 1999, the regulation was nearly toothless. The law was simply catching up to what the market had already accomplished in the previous 10 to 15 years, said Kathleen Day, a lecturer at Johns Hopkins University and an expert in financial crises. Take for example the poster child of the end of Glass-Steagall: The merger of Citicorp, a bank, and Travelers Group, a financial conglomerate, was announced in 1998 before Glass-Steagall was repealed. Even though this was the exact type of merger Glass-Steagall was intended to halt, the financial industry did not see many obstacles for the creation of Citigroup. "Citigroup and others wanted and got the repeal of Glass-Steagall in order to validate what they had already been allowed to do," said Simon Johnson, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. So the overall, decades-in-the-making decline of Glass-Steagall might have contributed to the financial crisis and its fallout, as it was part of the deregulatory push. But Clinton putting pen-to-paper on the repeal of Glass-Steagall in 1999 probably didn’t make any meaningful difference. But Clinton’s hands aren’t clean of the financial crisis, because his administration played no small part in the longer term deregulatory trend. Clinton and his administration did not make an earnest attempt to maintain oversight over the big, hybrid banks created by the demise of Glass-Steagall, Day said. Additionally, the administration’s firm decision not to regulate other aspects of the financial market played a meaningful role in the crisis -- for example, the absence of regulations regarding over-the-counter derivatives, which were becoming increasingly prevalent, despite internal warnings. Clinton’s claim "might be technically true, but it’s a sin of omission," Day said. Our ruling Clinton said, "There's not a single, solitary example that" signing the bill to end Glass-Steagall "had anything to do with the financial crash." By focusing on the bill that officially repealed Glass-Steagall, Clinton's statement ignores the fact that the demise of Glass-Steagall took place over decades, amid a deregulatory push in which the Clinton administration played a role. By the time the law to repeal hit his desk, Glass-Steagall had been whittled down so much that it wasn’t very meaningful. It's a matter of debate how much of a role the overall demise of Glass-Steagall had in causing the financial crisis, but we couldn't find any economists who argue that the regulation was the sole linchpin keeping the financial system stable until its official repeal in 1999. Overall, we rate Clinton’s claim Mostly True.	None	Bill Clinton	None	None	None	2015-08-19T17:22:43	2015-08-11	['None']
pomt-08347	As CEO of WWE, Linda McMahon "was caught tipping off a ringside physician" about a federal investigation into illegally distributing steroids to wrestlers.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/27/democratic-senatorial-campaign-committee/dscc-claims-linda-mcmahon-tipped-ringside-physicia/	U.S. Senate candidate Linda McMahon's experience as co-founder, along with her husband Vince, of World Wrestling Entertainment has proved to be a double-edged sword on the campaign trail in Connecticut. While McMahon often touts her experience running the pro wrestling empire to boost her real-world business cred, it also has left her open to accusations that the WWE uses sexist story lines and that there is rampant steroid abuse by some wrestlers. In the final week of the race -- which pits Republican McMahon against Democrat Richard Blumenthal -- the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has begun airing an attack ad that attempts to body-slam McMahon for tipping off a ringside physician about a federal investigation into the illegal distribution of steroids to some of the WWE's wrestlers. "Read this," a female narrator begins, as a legal document scrolls in the background. "It's a memo Linda McMahon wrote. Evidence in a federal trial against her company. McMahon was caught tipping off a ringside physician who was later accused of hiding evidence. It didn't work. McMahon's ringside doctor was convicted of illegally distributing steroids to her workers. That's Linda McMahon. A bad CEO. A worse senator." The memo in question -- marked "CONFIDENTIAL INTEROFFICE MEMO" -- was sent on Dec. 1, 1989, by Linda McMahon to Pat Patterson, a fellow executive at Titan Sports, the parent company of what was then the World Wrestling Federation. It became part of the public record as an exhibit in a steroids-related case against Vince McMahon and Titan Sports in the early 1990s. But the story actually goes back a little further, to an investigation into ringside doctor George T. Zahorian for distributing steroids to some of the WWF's wrestlers. As the 1989 memo from Linda McMahon explains, a government official let slip at a fundraising event that "the State of Pennsylvania is probably going to launch an investigation into the use of all illegal drugs including steroids." "In addition," McMahon wrote, "this fellow mentioned that he was aware of Dr. Zahorian and his relationship with WWF." Zahorian was actually assigned throughout the 1980s to attend WWF exhibitions in Pennsylvania by the Pennsylvania Athletic Commission. But following deregulation in 1989, promoters like the WWF were required to hire their own licensed physicians to be present at events. Zahorian was scheduled to be the doctor on hand at an upcoming event in Hershey, Pa., but Linda McMahon's memo makes clear the WWF wanted to distance itself from him. "Although you and I discussed before about continuing to have Zahorian at our events as the doctor on call, I think that is now not a good idea," McMahon wrote in the memo. "Vince agreed, and would like for you to call Zahorian and tell him not to come to any more of our events and to also clue him in on any action that the Justice Department is thinking of taking." It's that last part, telling Patterson to "clue him in" about a possible steroids investigation, that forms the basis for the claim in the campaign ad. In 1991, Zahorian was charged with distributing steroids to a number of WWF wrestlers (none of whom were charged because, at the time, it was not a federal crime to use steroids, only to distribute them). He was convicted and sentenced to three years in federal prison. But that wasn't the end of the matter. In the wake of the Zahorian indictment, federal investigators opened a wide-reaching steroids investigation into the WWF. And in 1992, the government filed an indictment against Vince McMahon and Titan Sports, alleging they conspired to "unlawfully provide WWF wrestling performers with steroids to enhance their size and musculature, and thereby to increase the ticket sales for WWF exhibitions and the profits to Titan and McMahon." In its indictment, prosecutors alleged Titan officials learned of a federal investigation into Zahorian's activities and warned him about it. Linda McMahon's memo was entered in the case as Exhibit #2. According to the indictment, shortly after the memo was sent, "a Titan executive known to the Grand Jury had a telephone conversation with Zahorian and directed him to destroy any records of Zahorian's contact with WWF or WWF wrestling personnel." It was later learned from one of Zahorian's attorneys that after Zahorian got the phone call warning him about the investigation, he shipped files on wrestlers to his attorney's office (so they were not part of the evidence seized when investigators raided his office). But according to longtime WWE attorney Jerry McDevitt, the files were never destroyed and were later made available to prosecutors. "Dr. Zahorian didn't destroy anything," McDevitt said. "It was all given to the government." In any event, the government's case against Titan and Vince McMahon failed miserably. Several counts were tossed before the case even went to the jury -- including two counts alleging that Vince McMahon and the company distributed steroids to wrestlers such as Terry Bollea (aka Hulk Hogan), because the judge said prosecutors failed to establish that the alleged conspiracy occurred in the jurisdiction of the New York court where the case was filed. And on the one remaining count, that they had distributed mislabeled anabolic steroids, both Vince McMahon and the company were acquitted. In other words, none of the charges ever stuck. In an extensive story about the issue in Connecticut's The Day, reporter Ted Mann asked McMahon about the memo. "I don't pretend to remember to go back, to revisit all the aspects of that case," McMahon told The Day. "It has been tried, acquitted and done with, and WWE has evolved its total health and wellness policy over the years, and I'm sure will continue to evolve." According to the story: When asked if her decision to notify Zahorian had led him to destroy records that might have more thoroughly documented his sale of steroids to WWF wrestlers — as prosecutors in 1994 alleged — McMahon's reply was curt. "I can't speak to any of that,' she said. "I have no idea." WWE attorney Jerry McDevitt said he believes the DSCC ad is misleading, because it suggests by innuendo that Linda McMahon sought to obstruct the government's investigation. "There were never any charges against Linda McMahon of any kind," McDevitt said. "There was never any charge of obstruction of justice against anybody." An indictment is nothing more than an allegation, McDevitt said, and the case ended without a conviction against anyone on anything. "You can only gain an acquittal in this country," McDevitt said. "That's all you can do." Everyone agrees Linda McMahon was never charged with or convicted of anything, including obstruction of justice. But the ad from the DSCC doesn't say she was. The ad accuses McMahon of tipping off a ringside physician about a federal investigation into distributing steroids to their wrestlers. How else could one interpret Linda McMahon's direction in the 1989 memo "to also clue him (Zahorian) in on any action that the Justice Department is thinking of taking." It's also true that a government indictment later alleged that, after getting a call from a Titan employee tipping him off to the investigation, Zahorian tried to hide evidence at his attorney's office. But whether Zahhorian tried to "hide" evidence may or may not be true. Zahorian sent files to his attorney, but they were not destroyed, and according to WWE's attorney, they were later made available to investigators. Nothing in Linda McMahon's memo suggests she directed the employee to tell Zahorian to hide or destroy evidence. But again, the ad doesn't say she did. The ad merely says she tipped off the ringside physician about an investigation. She did, according to her own memo. And Zahorian was later convicted of distributing steroids to some of her WWF wrestlers. We rate the ad True.

pomt-03417	A private school tax break in the Wisconsin state budget is "the most generous in the nation."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jun/27/tony-evers/wisconsins-new-private-school-tax-break-most-gener/	When it comes to taxpayer support of private schools in Wisconsin, most of the controversy over the 2013-’15 state budget centered on a limited expansion of the voucher program. But what could really set Wisconsin apart is a lesser known provision of the budget, which Gov. Scott Walker plans to sign into law on June 30, 2013. The provision would give parents, regardless of income, a state income tax deduction of up to $10,000 for sending a child to private school. The measure drew the ire of state schools superintendent Tony Evers, who voiced his objections on the June 23, 2013 edition of "Upfront with Mike Gousha," which airs on WISN-TV (Channel 12) in Milwaukee. "The Legislature expanded the vouchers across the state of Wisconsin. Now they’ve doubled down and decided, well, we’re going to give a tax break to parents that send their kids to private and parochial schools. And it’s going to cost $30 million in one year, and, of course, the next biennium it will be at least double of that," Evers said in the web-only portion of the show. "So, it's taking money out of the system that would normally go to public schools -- and it's the most generous in the nation. If you and I were billionaires and were sending our kids to high-tuition high schools, we would get, as billionaires, get the tax credits for that. It's obviously not progressive and it's going to hurt our public schools." There are plenty of opinions on both sides over the merits of a private school tax break. But would Wisconsin’s tax break be the most generous in the nation? The proposal In refashioning Walker’s initial budget proposal, the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee voted June 5, 2013 to add the tax deduction. As Evers indicated, taxpayers would pay $30 million per year less in income taxes. Parents of the nearly 100,000 students in private schools could get an income tax deduction of up to $4,000 for tuition paid for each kindergarten through eighth-grade student and up to $10,000 for each high school student. For a typical family, according to a rough calculation by the Legislature's nonpartisan budget office, the deduction would result in a tax cut of $240 for each kindergarten through eighth-grade student and $600 for each high school student. Evers’ evidence To back Evers' claim, Evers spokesman John Johnson cited a June 2013 article in Governing magazine. The article cited the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, an education reform think tank, in saying that only a handful of states offer tax breaks for private school. Those tax breaks, the Governing article stated, are "much less generous" than Wisconsin’s plan. We asked the Fordham Institute’s school choice analyst, Adam Emerson, about that. He said Wisconsin's $10,000 maximum is higher than any other state's. But he referred us to the Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice, a conservative organization founded by the late Milton Friedman, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, for more details. The Wisconsin Budget Project also based its analysis of the Wisconsin tax break on Friedman Foundation figures. The figures include apples and oranges. Some states, like Wisconsin, offer a tax deduction, which reduces the amount of income you pay taxes on; but others offer a credit, which reduces the amount of taxes you owe. Here’s a summary: State Income limit to qualify for tax credit or deduction Maximum tax credit or deduction Illinois None Credit: $500/family Indiana None Deduction: $1,000/child Iowa None Credit: $250/child Louisiana None Deduction: $5,000/child Minnesota* None/$37,500 $2,500/$1,000 Wisconsin None Deduction: $4,000/child for K-8; $10,000 for high school *There is no income limit to qualify for Minnesota’s tax deduction, which is up to $1,625 per child in grades K-6 and $2,500 per child in grades 7-12. But for its tax credit, which is worth a maximum of $1,000, there is an income limit of $37,500 for one child (and the limit goes up for more children). (Alabama also offers a tax credit, up to $3,500 per student, but it’s available only to students who transfer to a private school from a "failing" public school. And North Carolina offers a credit of up to $6,000 per student, but only for students with disabilities.) What’s clear from the chart is Wisconsin’s maximum deduction -- $10,000 for a student attending a private high school -- far exceeds the deductions in other states. However, Louisiana's $5,000 maximum deduction for students in kindergarten through eighth grade exceeds Wisconsin's $4,000 deduction. We wondered about the states offering tax credits. The Friedman Foundation ran some more data. Wisconsin’s $10,000 maximum tax deduction would result in a maximum tax cut, for families with incomes above $155,000, of $775. That's higher than the maximum credits offered by Illinois and Iowa, but less than Minnesota’s maximum credit of $1,000. However, there's no income limit for claiming the Wisconsin tax deduction, whereas Minnesota's credit is only for people earning less than $37,500. Moreover, Minnesota's credit applies only to education expenses other than tuition; Wisconsin's deduction applies to tuition which, of course, is the largest private school expense. All of which makes the point that, depending on a family's income, the number and ages of their children, and the income tax rates in their state, the benefit to them of a state’s private school tax break can vary widely. Our rating Evers said a private school tax break in the Wisconsin state budget would be "the most generous in the nation." It's among the most generous -- for parents with multiple children attending a private high school, for example. But depending on various factors, it's not necessarily more generous than other states. We rate Evers’ statement Half True.	None	Tony Evers	None	None	None	2013-06-27T20:29:41	2013-06-23	['Wisconsin']

That’s the headline of a May 8 article on a website that calls itself New York Evening News. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. You can read more about our partnership with Facebook here. "Head of Catholic Church says those who own weapons are ‘hypocrites,’ not Christians," the article said. "As pressure mounts to tear up the U.S. Constitution once and for all, Pope Francis has added to the sentiment by declaring that gun owners can no longer call themselves Christian." The link for the full text serves up a few more details on a separate website that paraphrases the pope saying that "when people claim to follow the teachings of Christ but also support gun ownership, it leads to a bit of distrust." This is all a bit of a mashup of remarks the pope made three years ago in Turin, Italy, in 2015, when he was at a rally of thousands of young people. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Perhaps most important, the pope wasn’t talking about gun owners. He was talking about war, trust and politics. And he singled out the weapons industry. "People, managers, businessmen who call themselves Christian and they manufacture weapons, that leads to a bit of distrust, doesn’t it?" he said, as reported by Reuters. Notice that he didn’t mention gun owners. That was the invention of the web article. The pope pulls no punches when he talks about war and arms makers. In his 2015 address to Congress, he urged lawmakers to work to "end the many armed conflicts throughout our world." And he added, "Why are deadly weapons being sold to those who plan to inflict untold suffering on individuals and society? Sadly, the answer, as we all know, is simply for money: money that is drenched in blood, often innocent blood." The New York Evening News article had the pope talking about gun owners when he wasn’t, and gun makers specifically when he was talking about the arms trade in general. Plus, it made it sound as though he was speaking recently and in the context of the current debate over guns after the shootings in Parkland, Fla., when in reality, his speech was three years old.

"Beyond the border, we’re going after employers who knowingly exploit people and break the law," Obama said in the speech on May 10, 2011. "And we are deporting those who are here illegally. And that’s a tough issue. It’s a source of controversy. "But I want to emphasize we’re not doing it haphazardly. We’re focusing our limited resources and people on violent offenders and people convicted of crimes -- not just families, not just folks who are just looking to scrape together an income. And as a result, we’ve increased the removal of criminals by 70 percent." Obama's claim that under his administration, deportation of criminals increased by 70 percent suggests a significant shift in policy, so we decided to check it out. According to data provided by the Department of Homeland Security, the number of illegal immigrants "removed" rose about 6 percent -- from 369,221 to 392,862 -- between the end of September 2008 (four months before Obama took office) and the end of September 2010. But a much larger percentage of those deported were convicted criminals. In 2008, 31 percent were criminals; but by 2010, the percentage jumped to 50 percent. The raw number of convicted criminals who were deported went from 114,415 in 2008 to 195,772 in 2010. That's 71 percent. So that squares with Obama's claim. Data for the first half of the 2011 fiscal year (which began at the end of September) suggests that trend is continuing, with about 52 percent of the deportations involving convicted criminals. In an Oct. 6, 2010, press release, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said the numbers reflect the administration's "prioritizing the identification and removal of criminal aliens who pose a threat to public safety." "Our approach has yielded historic results, removing more convicted criminal aliens than ever before and issuing more financial sanctions on employers who knowingly and repeatedly violate immigration laws than during the entire previous administration," Napolitano said. Roy Beck, executive director of NumbersUSA, a group that favors reducing immigration into the United States, said it's true that the deportation rate, particularly deportation of convicted criminals, has been higher under Obama. "My sense is that Obama deserves credit, for all the complaints about him, that he has done maybe a little better than Bush on deportations," Beck said. "I think the main context, though, is that the amount of deportations under Bush was rather small." And even under Obama, Beck said, the administration is talking about fewer than 400,000 deportations in a country with an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants. DHS statistics show that under Bush, overall deportations more than tripled between 2001 and 2008 -- going from 116,782 to 369,221. But in the latter part of Bush's presidency, the biggest jump was in the deportation of illegal immigrants who were were not convicted criminals. During the eight years of Bush's presidency, deportation of convicted criminals rose from 71,079 in 2001 to 114,415 in 2008. That's a 61 percent increase over eight years. In the first two years under Obama, the data suggest a policy shift toward prioritizing the deportation of convicted criminals. And Obama is correct that there has been a 70 percent increase.

pomt-00884	"Black people are eight times more likely to be arrested than white people" in Madison.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/mar/09/young-gifted-and-black-coalition/madison-black-adults-are-8-times-more-likely-white/	Two months before the fatal police shooting of an African-American man in Madison, an activist group called the Young, Gifted and Black Coalition decried what it called "the violence of heavy policing and arrest-rate disparities in Madison." In an open letter issued Jan. 9, 2015, the Madison-based group called on Police Chief Mike Koval to "dramatically reduce the number of police contacts with black people and poor people," and it made this claim: "Given that the arrest rate shows that black people are eight times more likely to be arrested than white people, we demand that disparity cut in half by the end of 2015." In the wake of the March 6, 2015 shooting death of 19-year-old Tony T. Robinson Jr., we thought we would take a look at the claim, which was repeated by U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Madison) three days after the shooting. Robinson case According to Milwaukee Journal Sentinel news reports: Madison police were called shortly before 6:30 p.m. when Robinson started jumping in front of cars on Williamson Street on Madison’s east side. Then in swift succession, Robinson apparently hit a friend and, after entering a house, tried to strangle someone else. A police officer entered the home, got into a struggle with Robinson and shot him. Robinson was not armed. The officer was injured, but did not need to be hospitalized. The shooting quickly drew comparisons by some with other recent high-profile killings by police of black men across the country: Dontre Hamilton at Red Arrow Park in Milwaukee, Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. and Eric Garner in New York City. Protests followed Robinson’s death. One protest, three days after the shooting, drew more than 1,000 people to the State Capitol. Nearly a year before he was killed, on April 25, 2014, Robinson, then 18, was arrested with three other people in connection with an armed home invasion at a Madison apartment. He pleaded guilty to felony armed robbery and received three years of probation. The officer who shot Robinson, Matt Kenny, who is white, shot and killed a 48-year-old white man in the line of duty on July 15, 2007, after the man pointed what turned out to be a pellet gun at Kenny. The officer did not know the weapon was a pellet gun, and the district attorney cleared Kenny. The claim The Young, Gifted and Black Coalition based its claim on an October 2013 report on racial disparities in Dane County. So, although the claim was about Madison, the report examined the larger surrounding area. The report was done by the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families, a Madison-based liberal advocacy group whose research is respected. The report said that in 2012, African-American adults were arrested in Dane County at a rate more than eight times that of whites. Here are the adult arrest rates per 1,000 adults in 2012: Black Adults White Adults Ratio of black to white Dane County 295 36 8.19 Wisconsin 230 53 4.34 United States 82 33 2.48 Erica Nelson, the author of the report, told us the figures were developed from an unpublished report of the state Office of Justice Assistance. She said she is working on developing figures strictly for Madison, rather than Dane County, but wouldn’t speculate on how the Madison rate might differ from the county rate. When the coalition first made its claim in the open letter, the police chief responded in a blog post, saying: "I have always agreed that the harmful impacts of racial disparity in Dane County are not in dispute. An education system that has underserved people of color, high rates of unemployment and underemployment, a lack of suitable guardians or mentors for our youth (leading to greater gang involvement), challenged neighborhoods and a criminal justice system that is fraught with inadequacies are but a few of the drivers that contribute to the malaise we face as a community." But, he added: "Based on the diversity and the strength of character personified in our workforce, the training which is second to none and ever-striving for best practices, coupled with checks-and-balances that serve to bring rogue cops or practices to the light of day, I will not buy into the naive supposition that our community's disparity issues are largely owing to a pervasive pattern of systemic racism by MPD." When we asked Koval about the eight times higher claim, he responded by email through a spokesman, saying that in his initial response to the open letter "I was not disputing the fact that there are racial disparities; I dispute the fact that I have ‘rogue’ cops or policies/procedures which are intrinsically racist. There is no doubt but that the police should be mindful of our role as the gatekeepers to the criminal justice system, and therefore ‘own’ part of this problem." The chief also noted that the figures from the report are for all of Dane County, not just Madison, which "includes big bedroom communities" such as Fitchburg and Sun Prairie. Koval said he has not seen any figures for only Madison. Our rating The Young, Gifted and Black Coalition said "black people are eight times more likely to be arrested than white people" in Madison. A report the coalition relies on says that in 2012, the arrest rate for black adults was eight times higher than for white adults. However, the figures were for all of Dane County, not merely for Madison, the county’s largest city. For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True. To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s web page. Note: After we published this item, the author of the research report cited above said she generated new figures strictly for the City of Madison, rather than Dane County, and provided them to PolitiFact Wisconsin. Erica Nelson said that based on a preliminary review of the Madison Police Department’s 2013 annual report, black adults are 10.9 times more likely than white adults to be arrested in Madison.

pomt-09243	Says federal law enforcement officers cut off questioning of the Christmas Day underwear bomber by giving him a Miranda warning after 30 minutes of questioning.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/10/rudy-giuliani/giuliani-says-us-only-questioned-underwear-bomber-/	The government's questioning of two accused terrorists -- Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who is accused of trying to bomb an airliner on Christmas Day 2009 using explosives sewn into his underwear, and Faisal Shahzad, who is being held for the failed Times Square bombing on May 1, 2010 -- has prompted critics to say the Obama administration is too soft on the terrorists and overly concerned with their Miranda rights. On the ABC News program This Week, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani joined many of his fellow Republicans in questioning the wisdom of reading the Miranda warning to suspected terrorists. Those warnings, which stem from the 1966 Supreme Court decision Miranda vs. Arizona, inform suspects in police custody that they have the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney. Supporters say that the warnings protect suspects from being coerced to incriminate themselves. But critics have argued that such warnings can prompt an accused terrorist to stop divulging information. In an interview with This Week host Jake Tapper, Giuliani -- a federal prosecutor in the 1980s and who served as mayor during and immediately after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks -- described himself as someone who has "administered Miranda warnings probably 1,000 times." He argued that "it doesn't make sense to interrupt a terrorist in the middle of his confessing and talking to you." As an example of the risks, Giuliani cited the case of Abdulmutallab, the Christmas Day bombing suspect. "Giving him a warning after -- after 30 minutes makes no sense," Giuliani said. "It makes no sense to do that. So, sure, it may work sometimes; it may not work other times. It's not the best policy to follow. And so far, two in a row, we've gotten lucky. So let's not rely on luck. Let's rely on solid policy." At that point, Tapper interjected. "My understanding, during the Abdulmutallab incident, is that -- is that actually after about 50 minutes they had to take him to get medical care, and that's why he stopped talking then, because he actually -- his life was in danger. But be that as it may, I hear the point you're making." It's worth noting that earlier in the conversation, Giuliani offered a similar, but slightly different characterization of Abdulmutallab's questioning, saying, "to cut it off after 30 or 40 minutes like they did in Detroit on Christmas Day ... doesn't make much sense." We e-mailed Giuliani's office but did not get a reply. We'll steer clear of the question of whether it's smart to offer Miranda warnings to terrorist suspects, because that's an opinion. But because Tapper raised a question of whether Giuliani was correct, we thought it would be worthwhile to sort out whether the former mayor's account is accurate. Right off the bat, we should acknowledge that we are hamstrung somewhat in evaluating this case independently, because the only information on Abdulmutallab's interrogation comes from the Obama administration, which is not a neutral party -- it is playing defense against Republican critics. Also, the administration's accounts of the episode came from federal officials who were not named in media accounts, although Attorney General Eric Holder did not dispute them when he testified before a House subcommittee and Republican senators have referred to the administration's timetable in a bill. That said, the administration's description of the interrogation of Abdulmutallab has been consistent on two key points: that it lasted for about 50 minutes, and that it was interrupted for medical reasons. (While the bomb in his underwear did not explode, it did catch fire, and he experienced serious burns to his groin and legs.) There is broad agreement that Abdulmutallab's pre-Miranda questioning was allowable under what is known as the "public safety exception." The exception was outlined in the 1984 Supreme Court decision in New York vs. Quarles. The court ruled that law enforcement officers may "ask questions reasonably prompted by a concern for the public safety" before they administer a Miranda warning to a suspect in custody. The media accounts have been largely consistent. Here's one timeline assembled by the Washington Post from information "provided by administration officials, interviews and past briefings for the media": • "12:03 p.m.: The plane lands, and U.S. customs agents come aboard and arrest Abdulmutallab. After holding him in a special room, officials decide at 12:45 to take Abdulmutallab to the University of Michigan hospital for emergency treatment of his second- and third-degree burns. While the suspect's burns are being treated, the FBI's Detroit special agent in charge picks two agents to carry out the initial questioning of Abdulmutallab. One of the two is a veteran counterintelligence agent with experience in Iraq and Afghanistan; the other is a specialist in bomb material. • "2 p.m.: FBI agents arrive at the hospital and discuss Abdulmutallab's physical and mental state with doctors treating him. • "3:30 p.m.: Agents begin interrogating Abdulmutallab under rules that permit questioning about immediate threats to U.S. security without the reading of Miranda rights. The questions concern whether other bombs were on the plane, whether Abdulmutallab had co-conspirators and whether there were plans for other attacks. 'It's to take advantage of the shock of arrest,' said one law enforcement official. The interrogation produced some useful intelligence, according to this and other officials. After 50 minutes FBI agents end the questioning 'when doctors need to take him in for additional treatment because his medical condition has deteriorated,' according to the chronology." Holder, in testimony before a House Appropriations subcommittee on March 16, confirmed the 50-minute interrogation while responding to criticism from lawmakers. He said, "That's a fairly long period of time. Certainly, not as long as what has happened subsequent to -- subsequent to that. But if you look at the report of interview that was gotten from him in that 50 minutes, hour, there was a pretty substantial amount of information that was got from him ... that proved to be actionable, that proved to be timely, and that continues to be, at least in some ways, the basis for a lot of the cooperation that he ... has shared with us." In addition, a Senate resolution sponsored by seven Republicans relies on the same timetable, saying that "local agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) interrogated Abdulmutallab for 50 minutes, during which time Abdulmutallab disclosed information concerning his training in Yemen and the operation of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula" and that "after 50 minutes, the FBI stopped its interrogation of Abdulmutallab, agreeing to continue the interrogation after he received medical attention for the burns on his legs and groin caused by the failed bomb he had sewn in his underwear." What is less certain -- and relevant to Giuliani's larger point -- is whether federal officials read Abdulmutallab the Miranda warning before it was clear that he would stop cooperating, or whether they Mirandized him only because he already had ceased to cooperate. The Senate Republican resolution agrees with Giuliani that the FBI acted first to read Abdulmutallab his rights, "at which point Abdulmutallab stopped divulging information and remained silent." A Jan. 24, 2010, Associated Press report, based on "a series of interviews" with federal officials, said that as Abdulmutallab was undergoing surgery, FBI headquarters dispatched a "clean team" to the hospital -- a new team of interrogators who would start the questioning anew, untainted by any pre-Miranda contact with the suspect. This is essentially a prosecutorial hedge against a subsequent adverse ruling by a judge to exclude information gathered without a proper Miranda warning. Information gathered by this "clean team" would likely be admissible in court even if the fruits of the first interrogation were thrown out. The AP reported that ultimately, "the 'clean team' of interrogators did not pry more revelations from the suspect. Having rested and received more extensive medical treatment, Abdulmutallab was told of his right to remain silent and right to have an attorney. He remained silent." This suggests that Abdulmutallab was Mirandized first, then stopped talking. In addition, having the clean team come to interrogate Abdulmutallab without Mirandizing him would defeat the purpose of the clean team -- which is to have an interrogation without any lingering threat of Miranda problems. On the other hand, a subsequent account -- the Post's, published on Feb. 15 -- said that "Abdulmutallab 'had begun to wind down' and 'gave indications he was going to stop talking'" even before going into his four-hour surgery, according to a law enforcement official who spoke to the Post anonymously. When the clean team arrived, according to the Post, he "refused to answer their questions and "acted like a jihadi." It was then that he was read his Miranda rights. To recap: There is some truth to Giuliani's claim. He is right that after the initial questioning, federal authorities stopped interrogating Abdulmutallab and then, ultimately, read him his Miranda rights. But Giuliani implied that authorities stopped the questioning in order to Mirandize him. Congressional hearings and news accounts indicate that the questioning went longer than Giuliani claimed -- 50 minutes rather than 30 -- and that it was interrupted because he needed medical treatment. After the treatment, he was read his rights, although the precise sequence of events isn't clear. We find Giuliani's claim Half True.

pomt-12660	Wealthy foreigners can obtain visas through a special program, but only a small number "invest in true high-unemployment areas. Almost every other EB-5 project uses gerrymandering to qualify as distressed."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/21/patrick-leahy/leahy-eb-5-visas/	Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy has called out an immigrant investor program as flawed and running counter to its intended purposes. "The EB-5 program … was designed to bring jobs to underserved rural and urban communities. And for some time it did just that. But the program has strayed from these goals. It's a magnet for fraud. Security violations are common," Leahy said as a witness during a House Judiciary Committee hearing. "And the incentives that Congress created to promote investment in distressed areas had become obsolete due to economic gerrymandering." The Vermont senator offered some figures to back his claims. "Only 3 percent of EB-5 investors now invest in rural areas … Less than 10 percent invest in true high-unemployment areas. Almost every other EB-5 project uses gerrymandering to qualify as distressed," Leahy said March 8. Is that so? His comments reflect a sample of EB-5 petitions filed. EB-5 immigrant investor program The EB-5 program — whose name derives from the employment-based visa granted to participants — was created by Congress in 1990 as a tool to attract foreigners and to stimulate the U.S. economy through jobs and investment. Initially, immigrants invested directly into new projects. But in 1992, Congress expanded EB-5 by creating the Immigrant Investor Program (also referred to as Regional Center Program). It allotted EB-5 visas for individuals who would invest in certain commercial projects associated with regional centers approved by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the agency that administers the program. Through EB-5, investors, their spouses, and unmarried children under 21 years old become eligible for green cards if they create or keep 10 permanent full-time jobs for U.S. workers and if their investment is at least $1 million, or alternatively $500,000 if it is in a Targeted Employment Area (TEA) in the United States. TEAs are defined as rural areas or those that have unemployment of at least 150 percent the national average rate. (More details on TEA classifications are available here.) USCIS told PolitiFact it does not have hard numbers on investments and jobs created through EB-5 but pointed us to a Commerce Department analysis of 562 active projects during fiscal years 2012 and 2013. During that two-year period, there was an estimated investment of nearly $5.8 billion by more than 11,000 immigrant investors, and the projects were expected to create about 174,000 jobs, according to the January 2017 report. (Investment on those projects from sources other than EB-5 was about $10.9 billion.) Government Accountability Office report Still, several reports have found shortcomings in the investor program, including cases of fraud and lax oversight. The senator’s office referred us to a September 2016 report from the Government Accountability Office. The report, produced at the request of the chairmen and ranking members of the Senate and House Judiciary Committees, analyzed investment in TEAs, how those areas were classified and how high-unemployment TEAs were drawn to meet the required unemployment rate. GAO studied a random sample of 200 of the 6,652 investor petitions filed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. Those petitions had not been decided on at the time GAO began its analysis. Among the report’s findings: • Almost all EB-5 petitioners elected to invest in a project located in a TEA, thus qualifying for the minimum required investment of $500,000. • 3 percent elected to invest in rural TEAs. • 97 percent elected to invest in high unemployment TEAs, yet 90 percent (of the 97 percent) combined census areas in order to meet the required unemployment rate. The other 10 percent (of 97 percent), used the unemployment rate of a single census tract, census block group, or county. In other words, 9.7 percent of all EB-5 petitioners elected to invest in an area that on its own met the TEA criteria. What experts say We asked experts who have researched the EB-5 program to help us evaluate Leahy’s assessment. They said data is scarce and limited, and that GAO’s estimates are the best available. Leahy’s reliance on the GAO report "is fair and reasonable," said Gary Friedland, a scholar-in-residence at New York University Stern School of Business, who along with colleague Jeanne Calderon, has testified on their findings about the program before Senate and House committees. "USCIS is not transparent and does not publicly release data about projects, TEA status of projects or individual petitions," Friedland said. "Similarly, industry (regional centers and developers) is not transparent and very protective of information about projects that utilize EB-5 capital." Unlike conventional investors seeking a risk adjusted rate of return, immigrants invest in EB-5 primarily — if not exclusively — to qualify for the investor visa and accept a very low rate of interest on their investment, Friedland said. As a result, they prefer to minimize their investment on EB-5 projects and seek projects that allow them to qualify for the lower-investment amount permitted for a TEA project, he said. Motivated to promote economic development, states have lenient rules to enable projects to qualify as TEA locations, and USCIS does not impose guidelines, Friedland said. "This has resulted in TEA gerrymandering where the applicant (regional center) is able to artificially expand the area for which the high unemployment rate is to be tested to include remote census tracts with exceptionally high unemployment rates that do not reflect the economic condition of the tract in which the project is located," Friedland said. "The states allow the census tracts to be connected in any direction and to form unnatural shapes." Friedland and Calderon have databases of large scale real estate projects that have raised or proposed to raise substantial amounts of EB-5 capital. "Virtually all of the large-scale projects in Manhattan are located south of Central Park, and generally these projects qualify as TEA locations by taking advantage of the gerrymandering permitted by the state," Friedland said. GAO’s analysis also shows that most TEAs are constructed by combining census areas, said Audrey Singer, a senior fellow at Urban Institute. "Few base it on a single small geographic area," she said. And while GAO's analysis is useful, Singer notes that the sample is indicative only of that specific period of time. (A footnote in GAO's report said petitions from the fourth quarter may not be representative of petitions submitted in other quarters.) "Without data from a longer period of time, there is no way to gauge how representative these trends are — say for the last 10 years, or the lifetime of the program," Singer said. Regarding Leahy’s claim that only 3 percent of EB-5 investors now invest in rural areas, that’s "likely close to correct," said Lazaro Zamora, senior policy analyst at Bipartisan Policy Center. The majority of regional centers are still mostly focused on real-estate development and other investment projects that gravitate toward metropolitan areas, Zamora said. "At the end of the day, this is a program that tries to attract investment, and rural areas typically have a harder time attracting it," Zamora said, though there have been projects that benefitted rural communities, such as a hospital that opened in a rural Arizona town with the help of EB-5 investment. Our ruling Leahy said, "Only 3 percent of EB-5 investors now invest in rural areas … Less than 10 percent invest in true high-unemployment areas. Almost every other EB-5 project uses gerrymandering to qualify as distressed." Leahy based his claims on a 2016 Government Accountability Office report that analyzed a sample of EB-5 petitions filed in the last quarter of fiscal year 2015. Experts say only limited data is available on EB-5 investments but that GAO’s findings are reasonable. GAO’s report reflects a snapshot and estimates of the petitions in one quarter. The program has been around for more than 20 years. We rate Leahy’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-07441	"Almost 37 percent of the total income from Planned Parenthood is from abortions."	false	/florida/statements/2011/apr/21/ronald-renuart/florida-republican-says-abortions-make-37-percent-/	Republican attacks on Planned Parenthood have filtered down from Washington to Tallahassee, where a GOP state legislator is accusing the not-for-profit group of operating a business plan that relies on abortions. State Rep. Ronald Renuart, an osteopathic physician from Ponte Vedra Beach, says Planned Parenthood opposes several anti-abortion measures being considered by the Florida Legislature because Planned Parenthood needs to perform abortions in order to stay in business. During an April 20, 2011, meeting of the Health and Human Services Committee, Renuart let Stephanie Kunkel, executive director of the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates, have it. "In 2008, Planned Parenthood, they put out a report, and it showed that they did 305,000 abortions and the average cost was $450," Renuart said (about 47 minutes into this video). "Their total income for Planned Parenthood alone was $374 million, of that $137 million was actually for abortions. So that's almost 37 percent of the total income from Planned Parenthood is from abortions. And to me, it sounds like they don't want to lose business." Kunkel, standing at a lectern where audience members can address the committee, later said Renuart was mistaken. "Mr. Renuart, 97 percent of the services that Planned Parenthood provides currently in Florida is prevention and education," she said. But Renuart stood his ground. "What I was quoting was a 2008 Planned Parenthood report," Renuart said. "That comes from Planned Parenthood mobile on my Blackberry here. Now are you claiming that, nationally, your organization is misrepresenting statistics and sending out false reports?" We wanted to check out Renuart's bottom line -- that almost 37 percent of the total income from Planned Parenthood comes from abortions. To set the stage, though, we need to explain the difference between what Renuart and Kunkel were talking about. Because they are not the same thing. Kunkel was referencing the services that Planned Parenthood provides, and she's right that abortions make up only 3 percent of the total number of procedures or services the group provides. (That's the figure that got Arizona Sen. Jon Kyl in trouble when he claimed -- incorrectly -- that over 90 percent of what Planned Parenthood does is abortions). But Renuart is talking about revenue, not the number of services or procedures performed by Planned Parenthood. And because different services or procedures cost different amounts, it's easily possible that abortions could generate more than 3 percent of Planned Parenthood's revenues. Therefore, it's possible that both claims could be correct. We contacted Renuart's office to see where he got his information but did not hear back. After some research, however, we are fairly certain we tracked down Renuart's sources. Planned Parenthood releases an annual report each year detailing its activities. The 2008 report is online, and several of the numbers Renuart cited match the report. In its 2007-08 report, Planned Parenthood said it performed 305,310 abortions in 2007 and that its health center reported total revenues of $374.7 million. Those numbers line up with what Renuart said. But Renuart's other numbers -- that the average cost of an abortion is $450 and that abortions generated $137 million -- are not in the report. Those figures came from pro-life bloggers, who have been making a claim similar to Renuart's for more than a year. We found the information from a blog called Live Action. The blog said the average cost of an abortion is $450 "based on what Planned Parenthood across the country has told Live Action staff. Although it is slightly higher or lower depending on what part of the country it is." Planned Parenthood's web site offers a range of costs for abortions -- which could include the procedure or the taking of a pill. The procedure costs about $350–$950 in the first trimester, Planned Parenthood says. The cost for what Planned Parenthood calls a "medication abortion" ranges from $350 to $650. So using $450 is reasonable. From there, Live Action does simple math. First, Live Action multiplies the number of abortions (305,310) by what it says is the average cost of an abortion ($450) to reach a figure for the total revenue generated by abortions ($137.4 million). Then they take the total revenue generated by abortions ($137.4 million) and divide it by the total revenue generated by the health center ($374.7 million), and conclude that 36.7 percent of Planned Parenthood's health center revenue comes from abortion. So Renuart's right? Not really. What blogs like Live Action specify, and Renuart doesn't, is that they are talking only about health center revenue. That makes up only about 36 percent of all revenue for Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood had $1.04 billion in total revenues in 2007-08, according to the group's annual report. Other revenue came from government grants ($350 million), private contributions ($250 million) and other sources ($69 million). So abortion procedures could generate 37 percent of Planned Parenthood's health center revenue -- but mind you, that's an estimate created by pro-life groups because the organization doesn't release that figure. If true, that's still only 13 percent of the total revenue generated by Planned Parenthood. Renuart didn't make that distinction in his comments during the House committee meeting.

pomt-06638	The jobs bill includes "President Obama's tax on soup kitchens"	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/15/eric-cantor/eric-cantor-blog-post-attacks-barack-obama-tax-sou/	Republicans portray President Barack Obama as an ineffective leader who has radically expanded government and done little to create jobs. And now, they say, he's out to hurt soup kitchens. In a Sept. 14, 2011, blog post, the office of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., took aim at one of the provisions of Obama’s jobs bill. The post was headlined, "President Obama's Tax On Soup Kitchens," and it criticized a tax provision included in Obama’s jobs bill. "Yesterday, it was announced that an astounding one in six Americans are living in poverty," Cantor's blog post said. "President Obama's response? To demand a tax on donations to soup kitchens and other charities that help people desperately in need. The president's proposal will impact approximately 40 percent of all the tax deductible contributions, and essentially penalize soup kitchens, hospitals, and churches that provide essential services to those who need them most. It’s no wonder this tax hike has been rejected on both sides of the aisle." We wondered if it was accurate for Cantor’s office to say that the jobs bill includes "President Obama's tax on soup kitchens." First, we located the section in the jobs bill that Cantor’s office was using to back up its claim. It’s a tax provision designed to pay for the new expenditures and tax cuts that are supposed to spur job growth. Here’s the summary provided by the White House: "This section would limit the value of all itemized deductions and certain other tax expenditures for high-income taxpayers by limiting the tax value of otherwise allowable deductions and exclusions to 28 percent. No taxpayer with adjusted gross income under $250,000 for married couples filing jointly (or $200,000 for single taxpayers) would be subject to this limitation. The limitation would affect itemized deductions and certain other tax expenditures that would otherwise reduce taxable income in the 36 or 39.6 percent tax brackets. A similar limitation also would apply under the alternative minimum tax. This section would be effective for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2013." In other words, this provision would generate income by limiting how much certain high-income taxpayers can deduct for charitable or other reasons. Roberton Williams, a senior fellow with the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, said soup kitchens theoretically would be affected if wealthy taxpayers cut back their donations because of the law. "Limiting the tax savings on charitable contributions will reduce the amount that affected taxpayers give," Williams said. "Some of what those folks give goes to soup kitchens. Affected soup kitchens will have less money to feed their clients, who will therefore be worse off." However, Williams added that the change is pretty modest. It would potentially affect only a tiny sliver of taxpayers -- about 2 percent of households. It’s not clear how much of a difference the limit on deductibility would mean for these taxpayers’ willingness to make charitable donations, either to charities generally or for soup kitchens specifically. And there’s no certainty that givers would cut their donations equally to all their charities. That said, while the proposed deduction limit would potentially affect only a tiny fraction of taxpayers, the high-earning taxpayers who would get hit by it give disproportionately to charity -- not surprisingly, since they have the most disposable money to start with. Statistics for the 2006 tax year showed that only 2.9 percent of filers reported adjusted gross incomes of at least $200,000. (Some joint households in this group do not earn enough to be affected by Obama’s proposal, but it’s the closest approximation in the data that we could get.) Yet despite the small size of this group, their itemized charitable donations accounted for 38.4 percent of all the itemized charitable donations made in the U.S. that year, by taxpayers from all income levels. So a tax hit to this group would likely hurt charitable giving more severely than a similarly structured tax hike on lower-income taxpayers. But is it fair to call the provision in the jobs bill a "tax on soup kitchens"? Clearly that's not what it is. The government taxes many things -- cigarettes, gasoline, property, incomes. But it does not tax soup kitchens -- and would not start to do so under this bill. (Quite the contrary -- any soup kitchen that’s a charity is fully tax-exempt.) The proposal’s impact, then, is much more indirect -- it gives slightly less favorable tax treatment to charitable donations, a fraction of which may reach soup kitchens, for a small segment of the tax-paying population. So the headline of the blog post is quite misleading. We also think the explanation in the text of the post, while more accurate than the headline, still goes too far when it says that Obama has acted to "demand a tax on donations to soup kitchens and other charities that help people desperately in need." Obama didn’t "demand a tax" on soup kitchens when he introduced the bill. Brad Dayspring, a Cantor spokesman, said the point of the post was that "eliminating a tax deduction for those who give to charities creates a new tax disincentive for that action, one that has otherwise not existed for a long-standing period of time. Bipartisan Members of Congress agree that this will have a negative effect on charities. … Soup kitchens are one such category of charities. … Ergo, President Obama introduced a new and negative tax treatment for soup kitchens (among others) this week. That is a fact." Our ruling Cantor's blog post was headlined "President Obama's tax on soup kitchens." That is misleading in two important ways. First, Obama did not single out soup kitchens for special tax treatment. And second, the proposal is not a tax on soup kitchens, or any other charitable organizations; it effectively increases the existing tax burden on a small percentage of households, which may indirectly cause disincentives for donations to soup kitchens.

pomt-06728	Every 1 percent increase in the number of Ohioans with bachelor’s degrees "means economic activity growing the next year and for each year thereafter (by) $2.5 billion dollars."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/aug/30/jim-petro/chancellor-jim-petro-says-boosting-bachelors-degre/	Ohio Board of Regents Chancellor Jim Petro was firing up the troops. During a speech Aug. 11, 2011, at Ohio State University to announce a new "enterprise university" plan aimed at cutting red tape for public universities, Petro preached to his audience of higher education types why pushing up the college graduation rate in Ohio is so important. Only 26 percent of Ohioans hold a bachelor’s degree, Petro told his audience. Raising that figure toward the national average of 31 percent would give Ohio’s economy a tremendous boost. While Petro told the crowd he’s seen various estimates of the economic impact of a rising bachelor’s degree rate, he said he had a "solid" and "good" estimate. Every 1 percent increase in the number of Ohioans with bachelor’s degrees, Petro said, would mean multiple billions a year in sustained economic growth. "For every percent we move up, it means economic activity growing the next year and for each year thereafter (by) $2.5 billion dollars," he said. While the correlation between education levels and higher wages for individuals is fairly well-established, we were struck by the specific price tag Petro was able to put on Ohioans getting their sheepskins. So PolitiFact Ohio checked it out. Spencer Waugh, a policy liaison for the Ohio Board of Regents, sent us three documents to corroborate Petro’s claim. In an e-mail, Waugh said Petro’s estimate of $2.5 billion is "fair and conservative" given that some studies show less and at least one study shows more. The first document was a memo from Waugh to Petro which claimed that a 1 percent jump in Ohioans with bachelor’s degrees would net an income increase of $1.09 billion. Waugh’s memo multiples the number of new Ohioans with bachelor’s degrees by $19,000 a year — a figure he says represents the annual gain for those going from holding a high school diploma to a bachelor’s degree. Waugh’s figures were based on a data from the National Center for Education Statistics as well as 2007 census data, according to Kim Norris, Petro’s communications director. The 2007 census data states that the gap is $20,000 per year for adults. The National Center for Education Statistics data shows the gap at $18,000 for males but only $15,000 for females in the age group of 25-34. So $19,000 is in the ballpark. Using the $19,000 multiplier assumes that everyone who went back to school and got the bachelor’s degree had only achieved a high school education. Presumably some in that group would be people who already have associate’s degrees or "some college" and didn’t have far to go to get a bachelor’s degree. People who have "some college" or an associate’s degree generally make more than those with just a high school diploma, and that would have an impact on net benefit to Ohio’s economy. Regardless, the figure is well below Petro’s estimate of $2.5 billion. The second document is a memo from Board of Regents staffer Patrick Maloney to Petro which outlines a 2008 Arizona State University study which found that a 1 percent jump would add $1.5 billion to that state’s economy. The ASU study focuses solely on Arizona and relies on a 2004 Journal of Econometrics paper that estimated the effects on the earnings of all working adults from increasing the proportion of the workforce with a university degree. It used data from the 1980 and 1990 census. However, the paper’s author, Enrico Moretti, didn’t specify how he defined adults nor how he calculated hourly wages. And Moretti finds a "spillover effect" which pushes up wages for all workers on every education level as the share of workers with a bachelor’s degree increases. Because Moretti’s spillover effect requires different calculations over each level of educational attainment, it’s virtually impossible to compare Arizona to Ohio as the states have different profiles. Additionally, Arizona’s labor market is much smaller than Ohio’s with only 1.82 million workers year-round versus 5.11 million in Ohio — nearly three times as many. If the gains projected in Arizona would come true in Ohio, then you could probably assume an economic benefit of nearly three times what was projected for Arizona -- about $4 billion a year. The third study cited by Waugh comes from a CEO for Cities study, which concludes that an improvement of 1 percentage point in each of the 51 largest metropolitan areas in the United State would increase aggregate personal income by $124 billion nationwide. In the report, the authors explain that each additional percentage point in aggregate adult four-year college attainment was associated with a $763 increase in annual regional per capita income. Per capita income refers to the income of each man, women and child. If we apply the increase to Ohio’s 11.5 million population, we get an additional $8.8 billion a year in income. So where does all this leave Petro’s claim? As chancellor of the Board of Regents, Petro wanted to show the importance of more adults getting their college degrees. To underscore this point, Petro claimed that a "good and solid" estimate showed that increasing the number of bachelor’s degree holders in Ohio by 1 percent would increase "economic activity" in the state by $2.5 billion a year. Asked for studies to prove this point, Petro’s staffers muster a pair of memos which assert Ohio’s income would rise by $1.09 billion a year and another which estimates that Arizona’s would rise by $1.5 billion a year. The Arizona estimate would extrapolate to about $4 billion in Ohio given the larger labor market here. Lastly, they cite a study done on the nation’s biggest urban areas, which if applied to Ohio’s population would mean $8.8 billion in additional income. The underlying point in Petro’s statement is accurate -- that raising the percentage of Ohioans who have a bachelor’s degree would benefit Ohio’s economy. What is less clear is how great that benefit would be. Petro’s estimate was $2.5 billion. But the supporting documentation his staff provided shows that estimates very wildly. Is it $1 billion? $4 billion? $8.8 billion? Something in between? That’s a point that needs clarification. On the Truth-O-Meter the claim rates as Mostly True.

pomt-13214	Says Sen. Rob Portman says Ted Strickland earned $400,000 a year as a lobbyist after leaving Ohio for Washington.	half-true	/ohio/statements/2016/oct/20/rob-portman/portman-strickland-duel-over-whos-richer/	There were times during the second debate between Sen. Rob Portman and former Gov. Ted Strickland in which the two politicians quibbled over who’s richer. The feuding over fat wallets emerged in the first debate when Strickland announced that he’d calculated Portman’s hourly earnings at $333.57, after factoring in assets and his $174,000 salary as a U.S. senator. Strickland, a Democrat, juxtaposed the dollar figure with Portman’s stance against raising the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. Portman didn’t dispute the figure, but in the second matchup between the candidates, he hit back with a calculation of his own. "(Strickland) went to Washington, D.C., and he became a lobbyist," Portman said. "He made $400,000 a year. So he wasn’t living on minimum wage, but he was working against the interests of Ohioans, including the people he used to represent." Strickland sounded surprised, responding, "The senator said I made $400,000. My ... oh, senator, that’s a big whopper. I’ve never made $400,000 in my life." We decided to take a look at Strickland’s earnings. Was he really a lobbyist pulling in $400,000? There are some issues with Portman’s attack. But he isn’t far off with Strickland’s post-Congress earnings, if you’re willing to include a variety of compensation into the picture. The first issue with Portman’s claim: Strickland was never a registered lobbyist. After losing his re-election bid to Gov. John Kasich, Strickland took a job with the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. An amended 2015 financial disclosure filing shows that Strickland earned $199,125 between April 2014 to March 2015. Strickland headed up the political action fund for the think tank. His position is listed as "director/counselor" on the group’s tax forms. So technically, he was not a lobbyist himself, but he oversaw the group’s lobbying arm. When asked why Portman called Strickland a lobbyist, campaign spokesperson Michawn Rich said, "He did not misspeak. Ted ran the lobbying arm of the Center for American Progress. It's a fact." The second problem is that the earnings in question are not as straightforward as a $400,000 salary. You reach that amount by counting income from various jobs and retirement funds. The Center for American Progress Action Fund reports on its 2014 IRS Form 990 that Strickland earned "other compensation" in the amount of $13,623. The 990 form reports compensation over nine months, and Strickland was there for a year. So if you divide $13,623 by nine, monthly compensation comes to $1,513. Accounting for a year’s time in that position, Strickland would have made about $18,164 in addition to the reported $199,125 income. Strickland also disclosed $20,000 in earnings from consulting at the Bipartisan Policy Center, and $25,000 from working as a mediator with the Washington law firm Taft, Stettinius & Hollister. He reported $36,700 from his state retirement, and $25,500 from a PNC Bank-administered IRA fund. Strickland is also earning a federal pension from his 12 years in Congress, which is calculated by taking an average of the three-highest salaried years in Congress, multiplying the average by 1.7 percent, and multiplying the result by years of congressional service. Strickland’s three highest-earning years in office would have been 2004, 2005, and 2006, so the average comes to $161,800. Strickland was in Congress for 12 years, and 12 x 1.7 percent equals 20.4 percent. We will estimate Strickland’s pension, then, to be about $33,000 a year. (No more math after this, okay?) See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com David Bergstein, spokesperson for Strickland’s campaign, disagrees that retirement earnings should be included as part of Strickland’s earnings in Washington. Subtracting the IRA and retirement fund, Strickland’s total annual earnings from a few gigs would be $295,289 — or $141.97 an hour. Our ruling Portman said Strickland "went to Washington, D.C., and he became a lobbyist. He made $400,000 a year." Technically Strickland wasn’t a lobbyist; he oversaw a liberal think tank’s lobbying and activism arm. As for his income, if you add his disclosed earnings, figures from public IRS forms and retirement income, you get an estimate around $357,000. Not everyone would tally up annual wealth this way. Portman’s statement is partially accurate but a bit sloppy in the details, so we rate his statement Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8b114f18-b218-4ac2-9ffa-4217a5401af0	None	Rob Portman	None	None	None	2016-10-20T17:33:33	2016-10-17	['Ohio', 'Ted_Strickland', 'Washington,_D.C.']
pomt-00850	Beer drinking is not allowed in any Illinois state parks.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/mar/20/howard-marklein/howard-marklein-says-beer-drinking-not-allowed-ill/	Amid the debate over Gov. Scott Walker’s 2015-’17 budget proposal, a number of ideas have popped up about how to generate revenue for Wisconsin state parks. Among them: Beer. Well, sort of. During a March 3, 2015, meeting of the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee, state Sen. Howard Marklein, R-Spring Green, suggested to Natural Resources Secretary Cathy Stepp that there was a way to capitalize on all the visitors from Illinois. Wisconsin already charges higher state parks admission fees for visitors from other states. Annual stickers cost $25 for Badgers and $35 for others; a night camping at Devil’s Lake, our most-visited park, is $15 for Wisconsin residents and $17 for outsiders. Marklein said fees could be raised, and the flatlanders -- er, Illinois residents -- would keep on coming to Wisconsin. Why? "They love coming up," Marklein said. "They can drink beer in our parks. They can't there." Wisconsinites have a long-standing love-hate relationship with visitors from Illinois. For many in the hospitality business, Illinois visitors are a vital source of revenue. Others fret that they overwhelm Wisconsin with big city driving habits and attitudes. But aside from the all that, we wondered if Marklein is right. You can pop a brewski at Devil’s Lake State Park, or other parks in Wisconsin, but you can’t do that in the Land of Lincoln? When we followed up with Marklein, aide Crystal Potts said the senator was basing his comments on a list posted in the Illinois Department of Natural Resources website. The list, under the tab "alcohol restrictions," lists 53 state parks and recreation areas -- from Apple River Canyon State Park to Wolf Creek State Park. The page says violators face a misdemeanor that carries a fine of $75 to up to $1,500 and one to six months in jail. That’s pretty steep for a Bud Light by the campfire. In Wisconsin, other than a handful of exceptions, drinking is allowed in state parks. But there are a couple problems with Marklein’s list. First, for many of the parks the list notes restrictions only at certain areas within a park, not the entire park. What’s more, there are many state parks in Illinois that are not on the list at all. The Illinois DNR confirmed that there is not a universal alcohol ban in that state. "Out of the 130 parks, there are 77 (where) alcohol is allowed," said an email from the Illinois DNR. "It is only banned in the parks that are listed." So we’ve got plenty of reasons for visitors to escape to Wisconsin and -- with budget troubles -- perhaps even a new reason to charge them more. But the pleasure of a cold beer on a hot summer night isn’t among them. Our rating Marklein wants to boost state parks’ charges for out of state residents, and -- noting how many people from Illinois come to Wisconsin -- he claimed visitors can’t drink in state parks in Illinois. But you can drink in more than half of the parks in that state. We rate Marklein’s claim False.	None	Howard Marklein	None	None	None	2015-03-20T05:00:00	2015-03-03	['Illinois']
pomt-11661	"Hollywood celebs: We will go on ‘total strike’ if Trump does not resign."	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/jan/09/Nourtey/hollywood-celebs-didnt-announce-strike-if-trump-wo/	Fake news reports said without evidence that celebrities threatened to go on strike unless President Donald Trump quit. "Hollywood celebs: We will go on ‘total strike’ if Trump does not resign," said a Dec. 30 headline on Nourtey.com, a fake news website that attacks Democrats. The story suggested Rosie O’Donnell was among the celebrities threatening to go on strike. Facebook users flagged the Nourtey.com post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. This story mimics earlier reports that have circulated for at least a year. Shortly before Trump’s inauguration, a similar story surfaced on therightists.com that said celebrities were calling for a strike within the movie industry in hopes that it would urge Trump to resign. Snopes found that the rumor stemmed from an ad in the New York Times by the group Refuse Fascism. The group, which included O’Donnell, called for millions to hold a protest to "create a political crisis that prevents the Trump/Pence fascist regime from consolidating its hold on the governance of society." Thousands of people, including musicians, actors, professors and authors, signed the petition as of Jan. 6, 2017. The celebrities were not calling for a strike barring Trump’s resignation. O'Donnell told NBC Late Night host Seth Meyers in November 2017 that she has been in a "severe depression" since Trump won the presidency and that she spends "90 percent of my waking hours tweeting hatred towards" Trump. The pair have bad blood going back to O’Donnell’s time on ABC’s The View, when she criticized Trump on multiple personal and professional fronts after his decision not to fire a Miss USA accused of drug use and other wrongdoing. We messaged O’Donnell on Facebook to ask if she had threatened to strike and received an automated message: "Please use my memes and articles as a resource to fight against Trump. I read all of my messages. #LoveTrumpsHate #ResistTrump Please don't leave hateful comments or memes on my page. Stay Rosie." So Nourtey.com said, "Hollywood celebs: We will go on ‘total strike’ if Trump does not resign." While O’Donnell was among the celebrities who signed a Refuse Fascism petition calling for protests leading up to Trump’s inauguration and has continued to criticize Trump, we found no evidence that there was a plan for a mass strike among celebrities.

pomt-06959	"Some criminals have learned how to spy on Americans, hacking into our home computers and looking out through the video camera attached to the screen."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/jul/17/sheldon-whitehouse/sen-whitehouse-says-criminals-can-hack-home-comput/	Alarmed by reports of computers being hacked in the United States, including at major corporations, U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse took to the Senate floor in June to call for a heightened campaign against cyber-crime. The country’s increasing dependence on the Internet, he said, "allows criminals, terrorists and hostile nations to exploit cyberspace to attack America, to invade our privacy, to loot our intellectual property and to expose America’s core critical infrastructure to cybersabotage." Whitehouse, a Democrat, went on to say, "Some criminals have learned how to spy on Americans, hacking into our home computers and looking out through the video camera attached to the screen." We nervously glanced at our webcam, wondering if anyone was watching, and just to be safe covered our mouth when we asked, "Is that true?" Then we reached out to several technology experts to ask whether hackers can seize control of our home computers and secretly keep a digital eye on us. "Yes, it’s absolutely possible to do," said David Sherry, chief information security officer for Brown University and former vice president of information security for Citizens Financial Group. "It’s actually quite easy to do. It’s really nothing new." The know-how has been around since 1998, said Sherry, ever since a group of hackers calling itself the Cult of the Dead Cow designed software that, once downloaded, could be used to control a computer remotely. With the proliferation of webcam-equipped laptops, the potential pool of voyeur victims has swelled immensely, he said. Adam Wosotowsky, a principal engineer at McAfee, a company that sells anti-virus and anti-malware products, agreed. Home computer users can be victimized by hackers who deploy software to exploit unprotected machines, he said. "So if they have a webcam, then you can take advantage of it," said Wosotowsky. How is it done? Typically, when computer operators click on a file, link or pop-up window created by a hacker, they could inadvertently install malicious software on their hard drives. That opens the door for hackers to control victims’ computers remotely. Just because something is possible doesn’t mean people are actually doing it. So we searched for examples of webcam wrongdoing. We learned of several cases. An Ohio man who was a registered sexual offender reportedly got 25 years in prison in 2007 for charges that included hacking into minors’ webcams and secretly watching and recording them in their homes, according to InformationWeek. A disturbing case took place in Texas in 2004. While instant messaging with a friend, a 15-year-old girl suddenly realized that her words weren’t her own. They were vulgar and clearly the work of a hacker. It became clear that the hacker was manipulating her webcam too when he sent a message complimenting her shirt. [He apparently was using the microphone too since he sent messages quoting things that had been said aloud in her home.] The FBI informed us of a 2010 case in California in which a 31-year-old man posed on a social networking site as a friend of teenage girls. By persuading them to download a song, he infected their computers. Soon, he could stealthily search hard drives of hundreds of computers for explicit photos and videos. When he found such material, he demanded his victims send more explicit material or he would expose them. He also was "occasionally successful" controlling webcams to catch his victims in intimate situations. Eric Strom, unit chief within the FBI’s cyberdivision, said that while the technology exists to manipulate people’s webcams, that’s not what most criminals are interested in. For instance, the same man who victimized the California girl also used a "keylogger" program to monitor keystrokes and steal credit card numbers and other personal information, he said. "They are looking for financial gain," said Strom. Still, he said he’s noticed in airports more people "taping up their webcams." That’s a simple step experts recommend to prevent webcam spying, as well as placing objects in front of the camera. If the webcam light comes on when you’re not using it, that’s a telltale sign it’s being operated remotely, they say. Sherry, at Brown University, recommends updating operating systems, keeping firewalls turned on and maintaining antivirus protection that also fights malware and spyware. If you rely on wireless connections to the Internet, he said, ensure that security settings are at the highest level and, when using unprotected public wireless sites, do not conduct sensitive transactions. Also, avoid clicking on anything suspicious. "This is something that can easily be prevented," he said. So let’s return to the senator’s claim that hackers are spying on people through their webcams. The experts say that the technology is readily available for hackers to seize control of home computers, including webcams. And while such cases are seemingly rare, law enforcement officials have arrested people in cases that involved webcam hacking to "spy on Americans," the phrase Whitehouse used. Before we issue our ruling, rest assured of one thing: No one has ever hacked the Truth-O-Meter. We rate this claim True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-13168	Says Marco Rubio "has a 98 percent voting record with the Koch brothers."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2016/oct/27/patrick-murphy/patrick-murphy-marco-rubio-voted-98-percent-time-k/	At the second U.S. Senate debate, Democratic U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy attacked Republican Sen. Marco Rubio for siding with billionaires Charles and David Koch while he was a U.S. senator. "We all know he never shows up to work, but when he does he has a 98 percent voting record with the Koch brothers, a right-wing special interest group," Murphy said of Rubio Oct. 26 in Davie. Murphy brought up Rubio’s alignment with the Koch brothers at both U.S. Senate debates, so PolitiFact Florida decided to see whether it is true. It turns out the 98 percent figure comes from a scorecard from Americans for Prosperity, a Koch-backed political group. The Koch brothers and Americans for Prosperity Charles and David Koch are no strangers to politics. They own Koch Industries, one of the largest privately owned corporations in the United States dealing with manufacturing, trading and investments. The Kochs also lead a vast network of political activist groups, including Americans for Prosperity. The duo provided seed funding for Americans for Prosperity, a 501(c)(4) nonprofit political advocacy group that has spent millions on Republicans in Senate races in states like Nevada, Indiana, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Groups like Americans for Prosperity are not required to disclose its donors and can advocate for political issues as long as it’s not their primary activity. The Koch brothers have ties to Rubio as he pursued the Republican presidential nomination and senatorial race. In February, when Rubio was running for president, the Kochs’ top political advisor, Marc Short, joined his campaign as a senior adviser. Later in July, after Rubio dropped out of the presidential race and slid into the Senate race, the Koch Brothers hinted at throwing support behind Marco Rubio, according to the Tampa Bay Times. AFP is one component of Charles and David’s broad network of money in politics. The brothers are set to to spend $750 million on this election cycle throughout their network. A third of that money will go to multiple political groups with AFP included, according to the Washington Post. In September, however, Charles announced he was merging all of the conservative advocacy groups into one entity — Americans For Prosperity. The leaders of three groups — Concerned Veterans for America, the LIBRE Initiative and Generation Opportunity (all Koch backed groups) — will keep their positions, but the organizations will now be branded under the AFP umbrella. The Koch brothers are not elected officials, so to reach his calculation Murphy is relying on a report card by Americans for Prosperity. The group ranks lawmakers’ floor votes and procedural votes "for economic freedom" each session of Congress, which covers a two-year period (AFP does not track procedural votes.). To Americans for Prosperity, "economic freedom" entails votes for limited government, cutting taxes and reducing business regulation. The number of votes AFP analyzes depends on the issues that were brought up while the Senate was in session. For example, in the 2013-14 session, AFP looked at 20 Senate votes and in 2011-12 session AFP looked at 35. Rubio has a lifetime score of 98 percent since taking office in 2011. (For comparison, Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson has a lifetime score of 5 percent.)

pomt-01928	Says Iowa Senate candidate Joni Ernst "promises to shut down the Department of Education and abolish the EPA."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/27/league-conservation-voters/does-joni-ernst-want-abolish-education-department-/	A new ad from a coalition of environmental groups tries to paint Iowa’s Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst as too extreme. The groups, which include the League of Conservation Voters, the Sierra Club, and the Environmental Defense Action Fund, kicked off a nearly $1 million campaign with a 30 second TV spot on June 23, 2014. The ad raises concern over Ernst’s promises "to shut down the Department of Education and abolish the EPA." It claims that these promises are "why extremist Sarah Palin and the billionaire Koch brother want Ernst in Washington." All in all, the ad concluded that Ernst is "Too extreme for Iowa." It’s not unusual for political ads to distort candidate’s positions. Does Ernst really call for the abolition of the U.S. Education Department and the Environmental Protection Agency? Our research showed that the ad was right on track. Ernst called for the closure of both agencies in April. Will she do away with the Education Department? Ernst is a state senator who won the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate. She’s running against the Democratic nominee, U.S. Rep. Bruce Braley. Ernst brought up both the Education Department and the EPA in the Republican primary debate on April 24, 2014. One of the moderators asked candidates how they would fund repairs for the nation’s "crumbling road and transportation systems." Ernst suggested cutting the federal budget to free up funds. "I do believe that we can make the cuts necessary within our federal government," Ernst said. She called for "closing the doors to the Department of Education at the federal level. And not just because it would save taxpayer dollars, but because I do believe our children are better educated when it’s coming from the state." We ran those comments by Ernst spokeswoman Gretchen Hamel, who said that Ernst wants to see power taken from Washington and put back in the hands of Iowans. She is "about state-driven policy," Hamel said. According to the Education Department’s website the "federal role in education is limited." States handle almost all education policy and issues. But, at the federal level, the Education Department takes on many tasks such as conducting research and overseeing state policy to prevent discrimination. It also awards and distributes federal financial aid in the form of loans and grants. The ad says that if Ernst is elected, 213,000 Iowa students would lose their federal Pell Grants. According to federal numbers, that is the number of Iowans who received Pell Grants in 2011-12. We asked the Ernst campaign what her plan for Pell Grants is, but we didn’t get a response. What about the EPA? While answering the same question that prompted her Education Department response, Ernst also mentioned the EPA. "Let’s shut down the EPA," she said. Ernst gave the same rationale for this slash in government, saying, "The state knows best how to protect resources." So, the ad is on solid ground. Ernst did say that she would shut down the EPA. Agriculture and manufacturing are two of Iowa’s key industries, and they are both heavily affected by EPA regulation. Hamel, Ernst’s spokeswoman, said that "Joni wants to have Iowa make its own decisions." The ad also refers to the Clean Air Act. This raises the question of how states would deal with national issues, like air pollution. Unlike the Education Department, where the states already play a huge role, this could be more complicated for the EPA. Two experts on environmental law told us that abolishing the EPA would dramatically reduce regulations on industry. "Nearly all states have seen significant cuts in the budgets of their state environmental agencies in recent years," said one of them, Joel A. Mintz, a law professor at Nova Southeastern University who specializes in environmental law. "Although some states may have the expertise, resources and political will to subsume EPA’s responsibilities, many — probably most — do not." Our ruling An attack ad aired by the League of Conservation Voters said that Ernst wants to "shut down the Department of Education and abolish the EPA." In an April debate, Ernst called for the closure of both federal agencies, and her campaign didn’t dispute that. We rate this claim True.

pomt-07540	"Every child born today inherits a $30,000 share in a national debt that stands at more than $13 trillion."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/04/tim-pawlenty/tim-pawlenty-says-every-child-born-30000-share-us-/	In his book Courage to Stand: An American Story, former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty -- a potential Republican presidential contender in 2012 -- addresses a wide range of policy topics. One of those is the national debt. "Every child born today," Pawlenty wrote, "inherits a $30,000 share in a national debt that stands at more than $13 trillion." We wondered whether his math was accurate. According to the U.S. Treasury, the total U.S. debt held by the public on Jan. 1, 2011, was almost $9.4 trillion. Meanwhile, the 2010 Census just determined the national population to be 308.7 million people. Divide those two numbers and you get $30,419 per person -- right on target for what Pawlenty wrote. But there’s a catch. Remember, Pawlenty wrote that the national debt "stands at more than $13 trillion." The number he’s referring to is different from the $9.4 trillion we used in the previous calculation. The $13 trillion figure refers to something related, but different -- gross federal debt, which is the sum of publicly held debt and debt held by other parts of the federal government. The additional debt included in this number typically is held by trust funds for major government programs, including Social Security and Medicare. Economists have told us in the past that they believe both measures to be equally valid. On Jan. 1, 2011, gross federal debt stood at just over $14 trillion, which works out to $45,433 for every American. So both of the figures Pawlenty used have a basis in reality, but they do not relate to each other the way he suggested. If Pawlenty wants to stick with the $30,000-per-person figure, he should have said that debt stands at more than $9 trillion. Alternately, if he prefers to stick with the "more than $13 trillion" debt figure, he should say that the amount of debt per person exceeds $45,000. Since both of his numbers are right -- just measuring different things -- we’ll give him some leeway and rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-05556	"Mitt Romney’s pledged to protect (oil companies') record profits – and their billions in special tax breaks, too."	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/apr/06/priorities-usa-action/mitt-romney-pledged-protect-oil-companies-tax-b/	An ad from a pro-Obama super PAC portrays Mitt Romney and the oil industry as cozy pals pledging big bucks to help each other out. It's a response to a different super PAC ad that attacked President Obama's energy policies. "Who’s behind this ad smearing President Obama?," the pro-Obama ad says. "Big Oil, that’s who. The money they make from high gas prices is going right into Mitt Romney’s campaign. Big oil executives have pledged two hundred million to help him. "And Mitt Romney’s pledged to protect their record profits – and their billions in special tax breaks, too. These guys all profit. You pay the price." We wanted to know if the ad was right that Romney "pledged" to protect oil company profits, so we decided to check it out. We could not find any explicit pledges by Romney to continue tax breaks for the oil companies. Instead, Priorities USA and others making similar claims rely on Romney’s criticism of Obama’s proposals and Romney’s ties to the oil industry. Eliminating oil and gas tax loopholes is one of Obama’s campaign promises that we are tracking on our Obameter. The Senate hasn’t been able to get enough votes to eliminate those subsidies, which the oil industry has vigorously defended. The industry and its supporters argue that the industry still pays hefty taxes and is a major job producer. Taxpayers for Common Sense concluded in a 2011 report that the oil and gas industry are poised to get $80 billion in subsidies during the next five years, and that the industry has doled out $140 million over the past decade to influence federal policy. The Romney campaign has criticized Obama’s energy policy as calling for "higher taxes" and for proposing "a $4 billion tax increase for oil and gas companies." Romney’s policies, meanwhile, call for reducing the corporate tax rate from 35 to 25 percent, but they don’t specifically address tax breaks for oil companies. Romney himself didn’t provide much clarity when asked directly about his position in a Fox News interview on April 2 with host Greta Van Susteren. Romney began his answer by saying "I'm not sure precisely what big tax breaks we're talking about" and then called for reducing corporate taxes: "And then there are various breaks and deductions and exemptions that certain industries have been able to win through lobbying over the years," Romney said. "What I'd like to do is to get the tax rate down so we're competitive with places like Europe, for pete's sake -- get tax rates down and eliminate a lot of the deductions and the breaks and the special deals that a lot of definitely industries get. And I'll look at them one by one." Romney’s silence on the issue has been duly noted. The Sierra Club complained recently that "Romney still has not been forthright about his position on the issue." The group pointed to Romney’s statement about oil subsidies in April 2011, when he declined to take a position on current tax breaks and again talked about lowering overall corporate taxes. The Sierra Club also points to the hefty campaign contributions Romney has received from oil and gas -- more than $750,000 according to the Center for Responsive Politics -- and the pro-Romney Restore Our Future PAC has received almost $1 million. The Sierra Club also notes that Romney’s chief energy adviser, billionaire oil executive Harold Hamm, has urged Congress to maintain the tax breaks for industry members. "Thousands of American jobs they create will be lost if 30 to 40 percent of the capital for drilling is eliminated through the loss of tax provisions," Hamm wrote in 2011. The next year, Hamm wrote that eliminating deductions for the industry "would give us no option but to reduce our drilling programs, resulting in fewer jobs and higher prices." We asked representatives within the oil industry if they view Romney as pledging to maintain oil tax breaks. "From my perspective, having been in the industry for nearly three decades, and having watched various politicians court or ‘diss’ the industry, I wouldn’t necessarily assume anything," wrote Kurt Abraham, executive editor of World Oil, in an email. "We have had politicians in the past, who promised to ‘help’ the industry, who did absolutely nothing, once they got into office. By the same token, I’ve seen politicians that weren’t necessarily thought of as ‘friends’ of the industry, who turned out to be more proactive toward oil and gas than anyone would have imagined. I think that it’s too early to say that Romney will protect the industry’s tax breaks -- I certainly don’t think of him as ‘pledging’ to at this point." Finally, if you’ve read this far, you probably won’t be surprised to know the Romney campaign didn’t respond to our questions about Romney’s position on tax exemptions for the oil industry. The Washington Post’s The Fact Checker also couldn’t get the Romney campaign to clarify his position. Our ruling The Priorities USA Action ad says "Mitt Romney’s pledged to protect their (oil companies) record profits – and their billions in special tax breaks, too." We couldn’t find any pledge from Romney to protect the oil industries’ tax breaks -- if anything, Romney appears to be trying to avoid making any clear statement on how he would handle those subsidies. But there are signs that he is favorable toward maintaining those tax breaks. The most notable evidence is his campaign memo’s criticism of Obama for wanting to increase taxes on the industry and the fact that his energy adviser is an oil executive who opposes "punitive tax increases." Romney hasn’t made a "pledge" but there are signs he supports the existing tax breaks. We rate this claim Half True.	None	Priorities USA Action	None	None	None	2012-04-06T09:35:46	2012-03-30	['None']
pomt-02242	"From 1972 until 2011, the number of EPA employees increased by 107 percent while the number of total federal personnel decreased by 15 percent."	true	/virginia/statements/2014/apr/14/morgan-griffith/rep-morgan-griffith-says-epa-job-growth-outstips-u/	U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith has long blamed regulations by the Environmental Protection Agency for the decline of the coal industry across the nation and in his Southwest Virginia district. Griffith, R-9th, introduced a bill to cut 15 percent of the EPA’s budget, saying the agency has grown "out of control." "From 1972 until 2011, the number of EPA employees increased by 107 percent while the number of total federal personnel decreased by 15 percent," he said on March 25 during testimony before the House Budget Committee. We wondered whether Griffith’s figures are correct. His spokeswoman, Andrea Pivarunas, sent us sources for the numbers. The EPA had a staff of 8,358 in 1972 and it grew to 17,359 in 2011, according to data from the agency. That’s an increase of 107.7 percent -- matching what Griffith said. We should note that EPA dropped to 15,913 employees last year as many cashed in on an early retirement incentive offered to federal workers. So if Griffith had used the the most current data available, the increase since 1972 would have translated to 90.4 percent. The total number of federal employees was 5.2 million in 1972 and 4.4 million in 2011, according to the federal Office of Personnel Management. That’s a decrease of 15.4 percent -- again, what Griffith said. The federal workforce figure requires elaboration because it includes civilians and uniformed military personnel, which have experienced different trends since 1972. Executive branch civilian employees numbered 2.82 million in 1972 and 2.76 million in 2011, a drop of 2.1 percent. Meanwhile, uniformed military personnel numbered 2.36 million in 1972 and 1.58 million in 2011, a decrease of 33.1 percent. So the reduction in federal employees has more to do with a smaller fighting force than with a shrinking bureaucracy. Now, let’s return to the EPA. What accounted for its sharp rise in employment? The answer is that the agency was barely out of infancy in 1972 when Griffith begins his timeline. The EPA was created on Dec. 2, 1970, to consolidate environmental quality programs in several federal departments. For example, the Interior Department worked on water quality and pesticides, while the Department of Health, Education and Welfare worked on air pollution, and the Food and Drug Administration conducted pesticides research. In areas where the federal government didn’t have oversight, state or local governments were left to fill in the gaps. Congress passed a number of laws in the 1970s that expanded the EPA’s authority: Clean Air Act to set national air quality, automobile emission and anti-pollution standards Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention to to restrict lead-based paints in government-subsidized housing, cribs and toys Clean Water Act to control discharges of pollution in surface water Dumping Act to control dumping chemicals and material in the ocean waters Safe Drinking Water Act to regulate public drinking water Resource Conservation and Recovery Act to control hazardous waste from creation to disposal Toxic Substances Control Act to cut health risks from synthetic and organic chemicals Superfund Act to identify those responsible for chemical contamination of land and compel them to clean up the contamination "The 1970s is known as the environmental decade because so much happened so quickly," said Daniel Fiorino, director of American University’s Center for Environmental Policy and a former EPA official. The agency started with 4,084 employees in 1970 and grew to 13,078 in 1980. Employment tapered in the early 1980s, but grew again in the 1990s with a sweeping expansion of the Clean Water Act and as concerns emerged about global warming. The EPA peaked in 1999, with 18,110 employees. From 1980 to 2011, employment at the EPA grew by 32.4 percent while the total number of federal employees -- military and civilian -- dropped by 11.3 percent. Our ruling Griffith said, "From 1972 until 2011, the number of EPA employees increased by 107 percent while the number of total federal personnel decreased by 15 percent." There are a few minor issues with Griffith’s choice of dates and numbers, but we won’t quibble. The EPA increase would have dipped below 100 percent if Griffith had used the most current employment figures from 2013. On the other had, Griffith could have made the growth sound more dramatic if he had started his comparison in 1970, when the EPA was born. We rate Griffith’s statement True.

pomt-03764	Forty aides who serve President Barack Obama "owe $333,485 in back taxes."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2013/apr/03/blog-posting/bloggers-say-obama-aides-are-delinquent-their-taxe/	April 15, the deadline for filing 2012 income tax returns, is almost here, so it was fitting that a claim about income taxes caught our attention the other day. The claim circulated in the blogosphere and some media reports, then showed up in a published letter to the editor of The Plain Dealer. The claim: Forty aides who serve President Barack Obama "owe $333,485 in back taxes." Sounds outrageous, yes? And after checking with the Internal Revenue Service, we can affirm that the claim is factually correct. Yet there is more to the story. , It turns out that the issue arises every year, regardless of who is president. And it applies to nearly every department of the federal government. "People who work for the federal government are no different from people who work in the private sector or for nonprofits," said Kay Bell, a Texas-based author, journalist, blogger ("Don’t Mess With Taxes"), former congressional staffer and current contributing tax editor for BankRate.com. We contacted her because she has written about the government employee delinquencies for years. "Everybody has tax issues," she said. Let’s break this down with numbers first, then provide some context. We got the latest numbers in an Excel spreadsheet from an IRS spokesman. His agency developed a reporting method in 1992 to comply with a congressional requirement that it provide annual reports on the tax delinquencies of federal employees. In 2011, the last year for which the filing deadline has long passed, 3.62 percent of the civilian federal workforce -- or 107,658 individuals out of 2.97 million federal workers -- had an unresolved federal income tax delinquency. This did not include taxpayers who have made arrangements with the IRS to pay off their tax debts. Rather, these are people who have not, cannot or will not pay. The numbers we presented so far include only federal civilian employees, not military personnel or retirees, because of the implicit rationale made in criticizing these workers: Those who carry out the regular functions of government ought to be keenly aware of the need to pay their taxes. Altogether, these tax delinquents owed just over $1 billion. But if you add active military members, reservists, National Guard and federal retirees, the number of delinquent individuals grows to 311,566, and the total owed climbs to $3.5 billion. Among the major federal departments, the Department of Housing and Urban Development had the highest delinquency rate, 4.42 percent. In exact numbers, 431 HUD employees owed a cumulative $5.9 million. Among large independent agencies, workers in the Government Printing Office were the worst tax delinquents: 167 employees, or 7.6 percent of the agency’s workforce, owed back taxes, to the tune of $2.3 million. As for the White House, the Executive Office of the President had 40 tax delinquencies out of its 1,902-member staff in 2011, for a rate of 2.10 percent. These employees owed $333,485 altogether. The delinquencies are of concern to some in Congress. But guess what? The House of Representatives and Senate have their own share of people who are behind in their taxes. Their tax delinquency rates are even worse than the White House’s. The House, including a staff of 11,812 and 435 lawmakers, had 454 tax delinquents in 2011, owing nearly $8.9 million, giving it a 3.71 percent delinquency rate. That compared with the White House rate (the Executive Office of the President) of 2.10 percent. The Senate, with 100 lawmakers and 6,930 staff members, had a rate of 3.33 percent, with 234 individuals owing the IRS $1.9 million. The IRS, alas, does not disclose the names of the deadbeats. This may pale compared with the public’s delinquency rate of 8.2 percent, but critics, led by Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz, note that federal workers are paid by taxpayers. As Chaffetz told Fox News’s Greta Van Susteren on March 20, "if they're not going to pay their taxes, they should be fired!" The only department that may use tax trouble as a reason for dismissal, however, is the IRS, which has an employee tax compliance and auditing program and says it treats indifference to tax laws as a firing offense. Chaffetz would like to extend such treatment to other federal employees. This is a lot of information about various departments, lawmakers and the White House. Yet bloggers ignored almost everything but the White House component. Consider entries such as this, in the blog Poor Richard’s News: "Surprise! Obama White House Aids (sic) owe $333,485 in back taxes." And this: "40 of Obama’s White House aides owe a total of $333,485 in back taxes – media silent," from a blog named "Fire Andrea Mitchell." The media was not silent, actually. The Associated Press had the story on March 8. These and other blog entries appear to build on a partial theme from a March 11 piece in Investor’s Daily Business and its website, Investors.com, by columnist Andrew Malcolm. Malcolm wrote, "This is the third straight year that the chief executive of the United States has been unable to get his own staff members to keep up with a citizen's legal income tax obligations. to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars in back taxes owed. All this while Obama has made such rhetorical hay about corporations and the wealthy paying their fair share." This was not the third straight year, however, unless you were measuring only one president, namely, Obama (2011 was his third year in office). These delinquencies have occurred every year, not just the last three, with some departments and administrations doing better than others. We know this because there have been other media reports in some of those years. But we also know because we requested multiple years worth of data from the IRS, and a spokeswoman provided us with the spreadsheets for every year dating to 2004. In 2008, the last year of George W. Bush’s presidency, 50 employees of the Executive Office of the President owed $812,917, according to reporting in 2009 by Bell, WTOP Radio in Washington and others. That put the executive office default rate at 2.93 percent, slightly higher than the current rate. The previous year, 2007, had an Executive Office of the President delinquency rate of 2.21 percent, according to a 2008 Washington Post report that highlighted a number of other departments and Congress, too. That’s confirmed in the data the IRS gave us. The lowest rate for the president’s staff during all these years was 2010 (so this was Obama’s staff), when it was 2.01 percent, the IRS data show. But in dollar terms, that was also the year with the most money owed: $833,970. In other words, fewer people were delinquent, but they owed more. The lowest amount owed by the president’s staff during all these years was $188,304, in 2007 (Bush’s staff), with a delinquency rate of 2.21. Yet in three of Bush’s last five years in office, his Executive Office staff owed more than $627,000. Malcolm, an opinion columnist, at least mentioned other government departments, as did subsequent reports -- which were quite balanced -- on Fox News. The partisan blogs, however, did not. Putting all this together, the claim -- that 40 staffers in the Obama White House are tax delinquents -- is accurate. Yet when presented as an Obama White House phenomenon, it omits pertinent facts. It fails to mention that this is neither new nor unique to this president or this branch of government. Based on PolitiFact guidelines, when a claim is accurate but leaves out facts necessary to get the full picture, the Truth-O-Meter is to read "Mostly True." That is how we rate this claim: Mostly True.	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2013-04-03T16:50:05	2013-03-28	['None']
pomt-06925	Said his mother had to fight with health insurance companies for treatment because of a pre-existing condition.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/21/barack-obama/obamas-mother-fought-disability-coverage-not-treat/	It's an anecdote President Barack Obama told several times while discussing the need for health reform. "I will never forget my own mother, as she fought cancer in her final months, having to worry about whether her insurance would refuse to pay for her treatment. And by the way, this was because the insurance company was arguing that somehow she should have known that she had cancer, when she took her new job, even though it hadn't been diagnosed yet," Obama said at a town hall meeting in Portsmouth, N.H., on Aug. 11, 2009. But a biography of Obama's mother and additional reporting by the New York Times have shown that a key point of that anecdote is incorrect. Obama's mother was fighting not for treatment but for payments from a disability insurance policy. A Singular Woman: The Untold Story of Barack Obama’s Mother by journalist Janny Scott documents the life of Obama's mother, S. Ann Dunham, an anthropologist who also worked on the issues of development aid and microcredit in Indonesia. The book documents Dunham's final illness -- uterine and ovarian cancer -- in some detail. Dunham's illness became acute when she was working in Indonesia in 1994, and she was diagnosed in Hawaii early the next year. Scott interviewed Dunham's doctor, family and friends for the book and had access to Dunham's correspondence and personal papers. According to Scott's account, Dunham's health insurance covered her treatment. But Dunham also filed a claim for disability insurance. It was the disability insurance company that refused to pay because they said her cancer was a pre-existing condition, according to the book. A Singular Woman goes into detail about Dunham's financial situation at the time she became sick. Dunham made a modest salary and sometimes struggled to pay her bills, according to the book. She was worried about the costs of her treatment, and the disability insurance would have eased her concerns. Dunham filed several rounds of paperwork trying to convince the insurance company to pay the disability insurance, intended as a replacement for lost wages. At one point, Dunham told the insurance company that she would be turning the matter over to "my son and attorney, Barack Obama." Dunham died Nov. 7, 1995. Scott concluded that Obama's memories of the matter were faulty. "Though he often suggested that she was denied health coverage because of a pre-existing condition, it appears from her correspondence that she was only denied disability coverage." The book was published in May. In July, the New York Times reported that the White House finally responded to their repeated requests about the book's findings. (Scott, the book's author, was a reporter with the New York Times who left the paper to finish the book.) The White House chose not to dispute the findings. "We have not reviewed the letters or other material on which the author bases her account," a White House spokesman, Nicholas Papas, told the Times. "The president has told this story based on his recollection of events that took place more than 15 years ago." Papas also said the story was still relevant. "She first could not get a response from the insurance company, then was refused coverage. This personal history of the president's speaks powerfully to the impact of pre-existing condition limits on insurance protection from health care costs," he told the Times. But as the Times story notes, disability insurance was not at issue during the health care debate. Normally, we steer clear of fact-checks about politicians' families or claims that are less than timely. But Obama used the anecdote to make a case for a significant change in the law that affected the national health care system. We find Scott's reporting and the New York Times story to be compelling evidence that he got a crucial detail wrong, and the White House did not dispute that. His mother was fighting for insurance payments as she was dying, but for disability insurance, not health insurance, as her son said he remembered. So we rate his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04796	Says Congressmen Paul Ryan and Todd Akin co-sponsored legislation "to limit federal funding for abortion to victims of ‘forcible rape.’"	true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/aug/22/john-wisniewski/paul-ryan-and-todd-akin-co-sponsored-bill-limiting/	Presumptive Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, have tried to distance themselves in recent days from comments made by a Missouri congressman about pregnancies being rare in cases of "legitimate rape." But the chairman of the New Jersey Democratic Party claimed Tuesday that Ryan, a Wisconsin congressman, and Missouri Republican Todd Akin have both backed a bill limiting federal funding for abortions to victims of "forcible rape." "While Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan rushed to throw Congressman Akin under the bus following his repugnant comments, we know that in reality, Republicans share many of Akin’s most offensive views on the issue of choice," John Wisniewski, a state assemblyman, said in a news release. "Ryan co-sponsored legislation with Akin to limit federal funding for abortion to victims of ‘forcible rape’ - as if there is any other kind of rape?" Wisniewski is correct that Ryan and Akin co-sponsored legislation in July 2010 and January 2011 that, as originally written, limited federal funding for abortions to pregnancies resulting from "forcible rape" and certain other circumstances. But the party chairman failed to mention that the term "forcible" was later removed from the bill before its passage in the House. In a statement, Wisniewski argued that the congressmen became co-sponsors when the legislation still contained the phrase "forcible rape." "While the term was removed after significant public outcry, it is telling that the phrase did not raise any red flags for either Ryan or Akin in July 2010 or January 2011 when they signed on as original co-sponsors," Wisniewski said. Let’s explain the bill’s history. The legislation -- known as the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act -- was first introduced on July 29, 2010 by New Jersey Congressman Chris Smith (R-4th Dist.). Ryan and Akin signed on as co-sponsors at the time of the bill’s introduction. That version of the bill prohibited federal funding for abortions, except in certain cases -- including "forcible rape." But with Democrats still in control of the House, the bill didn't move forward. After the GOP took control of the House, Smith re-introduced the bill on Jan. 20, 2011. Again, at the time of introduction, Ryan and Akin became co-sponsors, and the legislation still contained the phrase "forcible rape." Yet that term ignited an outcry among various critics, who said the phrase would exclude victims of statutory rape or rapes involving drugs. By early February 2011, Smith had agreed to remove the term "forcible" from the legislation. When the House passed the bill in a 251-175 vote on May 4, 2011, the legislation allowed federal funding for abortions in all cases of rape. The final version of the bill said such funding was permissible if "(1) if the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest; or (2) in the case where a woman suffers from a physical disorder, physical injury, or physical illness that would, as certified by a physician, place the woman in danger of death unless an abortion is performed, including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself." Ryan and Akin voted for the bill, along with Smith and the other five GOP congressmen from New Jersey. Seven House Democrats from New Jersey voted against the bill. The U.S. Senate never voted on the legislation. Our ruling In a news release, Wisniewski claimed Ryan and Akin co-sponsored legislation "to limit federal funding for abortion to victims of ‘forcible rape.’" It’s accurate that the two congressmen co-sponsored the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, first in July 2010 and again in January 2011. Both original versions of the bill limited federal funding for abortions to pregnancies resulting from "forcible rape" and certain other circumstances. The term "forcible" was later removed from the bill, allowing federal funding for abortions in all cases of rape. But when Ryan and Akin originally signed on, the legislation included the phrase "forcible rape." We rate the statement True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-07792	Road construction bids "are coming in at the lowest in the modern era."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2011/feb/19/bob-mcdonnell/gov-bob-mcdonnell-says-virginia-road-bids-are-lowe/	It’s an ideal time to build roads, Gov. Bob McDonnell says. He’s telling everyone that interest rates are low, the improvements are badly needed and bids on highway projects are coming in dirt cheap. The arguments have gained traction in the General Assembly. The House and Senate have passed versions of McDonnell’s proposal to accelerate the issuance of $1.8 billion in bonds to fund road projects across Virginia over the next three years. McDonnell, a Republican, set the goal during his State of the Commonwealth Address to the legislature last month. In laying out reasons to speed up borrowing for roads, he said, "Bids on construction are coming in at the lowest in the modern era." We’ve heard supportive legislators repeat McDonnell’s line about bids -- or versions of it -- and wanted to know if it is true. First, we asked for clarification. How does the McDonnell define the "modern era" when it comes to road bids? "He’s talking about a generation, about 20 years," Tucker Martin, the governor’s chief of communications said. So McDonnell is saying bids for road construction are the lowest in about 20 years. Martin said the information came from the Virginia Department of Transportation and urged us to call Malcolm Kerley, the chief engineer. Kerley could not confirm McDonnell’s claim, explaining that VDOT does not keep annual records of the overall rise or fall in state construction bids. "Historically, we haven’t done it," said Kerley, a 40-year employee at VDOT. "I don’t remember anyone asking for it." Kerley acknowledged that last year bids for large state road projects were indeed low. They came in an average 17 percent below VDOT’s projections, he said. VDOT had not tracked the figure prior to 2010. "I don’t know if we’re making history or not," he said. With the construction industry hurting, Kerley said competition among contractors for road work has increased, resulting in lower bids. Last year, about 130 new firms sought to qualify to bid on state highway work, Kerley said. During a normal year, "10 to 20" new companies seek qualification, he added. We called Jeff Southard, executive vice-president of the Virginia Transportation Construction Alliance, a lobby for road contractors. Although he, too, is also convinced bids are coming in low, he had no data to offer other than what VDOT told us. "People are looking for work and it’s very competitive," Southard said. "You see companies that used to do commercial work bidding on highway work. You see a lot more companies coming in from out of state and expanding their geographical boundaries." OK, we’re convinced road prices are good right now. But is there any historical data that will tell us how good? We found a few interesting charts that cast doubt on McDonnell’s claim bids are the best lowest in 20 years. A Bureau of Labor Statistics index shows the cost of highway construction materials went up 98 percent nationally between 1990 and the middle of 2010. The Federal Highway Administration began a quarterly measure of road construction costs in 2003. The index shows that costs at the end of last June -- the latest time available -- plunged 28 percent since the summer of 2008, when oil prices hit all-time highs. Oil is a key ingredient in asphalt. Even with the drop, construction costs at the end of June were not at the low point in the 7 1/2-year history of the index. They were the cheapest prices since March, 2004. A road building cost index for five Western states goes back 20 years -- exactly the span McDonnell referred to in his speech. Since 1990, construction costs in those five states went up an average of 115 percent. Given these indexes and the lack of any historical data in Virginia, is it possible that McDonnell is right and construction bids are coming in the lowest in two decades? Ken Simonson, chief economist for the Associated General Contractors of America, did not want to weigh in specifically on the governor’s claim, citing the dearth of data from Virginia. But he said the indexes we are using are reliable. Simonson said Virginia may not have seen quite the increase in road costs over the last 20 years experienced by the more mountainous Western states. On the other hand, he added that Virginia has not been immune to a steady rise over two decades in the price of road construction materials such as oil, steel, copper and concrete. Let’s review: McDonnell says Virginia’s highway construction bids "are coming in at the lowest of the modern era." His communications chief says the governor was referring to about 20-year time span. McDonnell offers no statistical proof for his claim because such data has never been kept in Virginia. But there is data that undercuts the governor’s claim. A Bureau of Labor Statistics index shows the price of highway construction materials went up 98 percent over the last 20 years. A Federal Highway Administration index shows road construction prices are the lowest in six years. The Western state index shows highway prices have increased by 115 percent since 1990. While circumstantial evidence certainly suggests the governor statement is inaccurate, we can not establish that beyond all reasonable doubt. We rate McDonnell’s claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-00356	"Puerto Rico’s electric grid and their electric generating plant was dead before the storms ever hit. It was in very bad shape. It was in bankruptcy. It had no money. It was largely -- you know, it was largely closed."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/sep/13/donald-trump/puerto-ricos-power-grid-was-weak-not-dead-hurrican/	As Hurricane Florence approached, President Donald Trump relied on his track record to assure the public his administration is ready. "I think that Puerto Rico was an incredible, unsung success," Trump told reporters on Sept. 11. Puerto Rico recovered full power in August, 11 months after Hurricane Maria. Trump attributed the struggle to the territory’s floundering power system. "Puerto Rico got hit not with one hurricane but with two (hurricanes)," Trump said. "And the problem with Puerto Rico is their electric grid and their electric generating plant was dead before the storms ever hit. It was in very bad shape. It was in bankruptcy. It had no money. It was largely — you know, it was largely closed." "And when the storm hit, they had no electricity — essentially before the storm," Trump said. "And when the storm hit, that took it out entirely." Was the power system dead on arrival? Trump is exaggerating. The White House pointed to the power grid’s state of disrepair. First, there’s a difference between the electric grid and generating plants. Plants produce electricity using fossil fuels or renewable energies, while the grid ensures that power gets to the areas that need it. Jorge Carmacho, a senior policy advisor at Urban Ingenuity who assessed the electric infrastructure damages after the hurricanes for the government of Puerto Rico, estimated roughly 30 percent of the generating plants were not operational before the storm hit. He identified two reasons. One is non-compliance with Environmental Protection Agency rules, which set limits on fossil fuel burning. The other was maintenance, propagated by unprecedented oversight by Puerto Rico’s recently created Energy Commission. One of the main issues they were trying to fix was the grid, which Trump also mentioned. It is run by PREPA, a government utilities program, which is bankrupt, as Trump said. It faces $9 billion of debt. Trump was right in saying it was in very bad shape. But it wasn’t dead or closed. Before the hurricanes hit, all customers were being serviced, according to James Gallagher, executive director of New York State Smart Grid Consortium, which is working to stabilize Puerto Rico’s grid. About 10 to 15 percent of customers lost power after the first hurricane, Irma. But coverage was spotty even before the hurricanes. In 2016, for example, a fire resulted in a three-day blackout. The consulting firm Synapse Energy Economics estimated that on average, customers face a power outage every three months. "PREPA was in bankruptcy," Carmacho said. "That’s true. But were they pushing electrons to people so they could turn on the lights? Yes. Was it reliable? No. it hasn’t been reliable in 20 years. We might have an outage every three days. That has been the norm." The bulk of Puerto Rico’s generating plants are located in the southern part of the island, while consumption is mostly in the north. The complex system that transfers energy from one side to the other forms its Achilles heel during climate disasters like this one, according to Marla Perez Lugo, a sociologist at the University of Puerto Rico focusing on energy policy. Unlike in the United States, where an outage in Ohio can be fixed by connecting to the grid in Illinois, an island electric system relies on reserves, on which Puerto Rico falls short, according to Carmacho. Our ruling Trump said "Puerto Rico’s electric grid and their electric generating plant was dead before the storms ever hit. It was in very bad shape. It was in bankruptcy. It had no money. It was largely -- you know, it was largely closed." Some electric generating plants, not the majority, were inoperative before the storm hit due to maintenance work. The grid was servicing all customers but had important vulnerabilities. Trump's statement is partially accurate. We rate it Half True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Correction Sept. 13, 2018: PREPA, the Puerto Rico government utilities program, has debts totaling $9 billion.

pomt-00875	"I unsealed my records" at Marquette University.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/mar/12/scott-walker/where-are-scott-walkers-student-records/	The circumstances around Gov. Scott Walker's withdrawal from Marquette University were murky enough to arouse questions, more than two decades later, about whether bad grades or misbehavior may have led him to quit school roughly a year short of a degree. Deep dives into Walker's college days by PolitiFact Wisconsin -- and later by national media as he emerged as a Republican presidential hopeful -- showed Walker was in "good standing" when he dropped out in 1990, taking a job with the American Red Cross and running unsuccessfully for the state Assembly. But no actual documents, such as a college transcript, turned up to shed light on Walker’s academic performance or on a controversy involving his run for student government president. Yet on Feb. 27, 2015, while attending the Conservative Political Action Conference outside of Washington, D.C. with other potential White House contenders, Walker suggested there was nothing murky at all about his time at Marquette, a Catholic university in Milwaukee. During an interview with Dana Loesch, a conservative radio and Blaze TV talk show host based in Dallas, Walker made a claim as Loesch prepared to ask a question. "A lot of folks like myself thought it a little elitist -- because everybody’s vetting you now. You’ve already been more vetted than the current commander-in-chief," Loesch said. "Yeah," Walker interjected, with a chuckle. "And more written about my college days than the president. I unsealed my records." Really? 2010 Let’s start with a closer look at Walker’s claim -- that he "unsealed" his records. First, it suggests he did something proactively -- the way presidential candidates often release their tax returns. Second, it clearly suggests the information involved is complete and unfiltered -- that is, the documents themselves. In 2010, during Walker’s successful campaign for governor, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel requested college transcripts from Walker and two other leading candidates, former Republican Congressman Mark Neumann and Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, a Democrat. Neumann and Barrett provided them. Walker refused. Instead, his campaign said Walker had a grade point average of 2.59. (On a 4-point scale, that's in the range of a C-plus or a B-minus.) Walker also released a letter from Marquette that showed he attended the school for four years, from 1986 to 1990, and would have needed to stay there for at least another year to get a degree. 2013 PolitiFact Wisconsin published its article on Walker’s college days in December 2013. At the time, he was gearing up for re-election and raising his national profile, yet the story of his formative political years remained surprisingly disputed. Indeed, Wisconsin Democrats were claiming the governor was "kicked out" of student elections at Marquette (a claim we rated False) -- and maybe was booted from Marquette altogether. The article reported on Walker’s run, as a sophomore, for student government president. After the Marquette Tribune student newspaper endorsed Walker’s opponent, on the day before the election, there were allegations that Walker supporters emptied editions of the Tribune from racks in high-traffic buildings. Walker’s camp denied the allegations, but Walker lost the election. Marquette ordered an investigation, but details of the alleged dumping of the newspapers were not readily available in the public record, much less evidence of who may have been behind the acts. Asked by PolitiFact if he was "forced out" of Marquette for any reason, Walker said: "I can say unequivocally that isn’t true." And PolitiFact found no evidence that he had. But the article made an important point -- that "publicly available documents cannot fully resolve the question, in part because a federal privacy law blocks release of information on former students unless the person consents. In addition, Walker told us he was sticking to an earlier decision not to release his transcript." With that in mind, PolitiFact asked Walker if he would allow Marquette to comment on his academic and conduct record. He did. Marquette confirmed in a statement that Walker was a student from fall of 1986 until spring 1990 and, when he voluntarily withdrew, was a senior in good standing. At Marquette, being in "good standing" means a student is eligible to register and has no academic or non-academic conduct issues restricting registration. PolitiFact then asked Marquette whether any conduct issues were on Walker’s earlier school record, and was told Walker would have to permit release of that information. Walker did so. Walker was in good standing during each term while he was enrolled at Marquette, and was not suspended or expelled at any time, the school said in a letter. The school made clear that Walker had authorized only that limited release of information and only to PolitiFact Wisconsin. In other words, there was no general release or unsealing of documents. 2015 The pattern continued as Walker’s stock as a presidential contender rose. In February 2015, two weeks after lengthy stories about Walker’s college days appeared in the Washington Post and Boston Globe, Walker released a one-sentence letter showing he had authorized Marquette "to confirm my academic standing for each term and that I voluntarily withdrew from Marquette University in good standing in the spring of 1990." Nothing new there. When we contacted the governor’s office for this fact check, spokeswoman Laurel Patrick forwarded us a copy of that letter. When we asked if that meant there had been no unsealing of documents, she replied by saying: "This effectively unseals his records, which is what he said. It gives Marquette University authorization to provide information about his record." But the limited comments Walker allowed Marquette to make about his record, of course, are far from any unsealing of the records themselves. It is more akin to a statement that you paid your taxes on time, rather than producing the returns themselves. Our rating Walker said he "unsealed" his student records at Marquette University. In fact, he has taken only the very limited step of authorizing the school to confirm that he was in "good standing" during his time at Marquette and that he voluntarily withdrew. We haven’t seen any records. We rate Walker’s statement False.

pomt-14906	"‘Dark money’ spending" in the 2016 election cycle "is 10 times what it was at the same point in the 2012 election cycle," when it topped $308 million.	true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/nov/05/tammy-baldwin/ten-times-more-dark-money-has-been-spent-2016-elec/	Soliciting contributions to her campaign fund, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin warned her supporters about the dangers of "dark money" -- cash spent on elections by groups that don’t have to disclose their donors. In an Oct. 30, 2015 email, the Wisconsin Democrat wrote that groups backed by conservatives such as Karl Rove and the Koch brothers "have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to make sure they get right-wing extremists elected into office. And it’s only getting worse." "Today," Baldwin’s email continued, "dark money spending is 10 times what it was at the same point in the 2012 election cycle. And in 2012, it ended up topping $308 million." Then she asked for a contribution of $5 or more. A year away from the 2016 general election, is dark-money spending already 10 times higher than it was at this point four years ago? The answer, from the source widely acknowledged as the best in this area: Yes. What dark is We consulted the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan campaign finance research group that runs a website called OpenSecrets.org. (Two other groups involved in campaign finance -- the Sunlight Foundation and the Campaign Finance Institute -- also referred us to the center.) Using data from the Federal Election Commission, the Center for Responsive Politics tracks so-called dark-money spending -- that is, expenditures by nonprofit groups, whose primary function is not supposed to be political activity, that don’t have to disclose their donors. Those groups can receive unlimited corporate, individual, or union contributions. They can use the money for various election activities, including buying ads that advocate for or against a candidate, running phone banks and making contributions to super PACs. But they can’t coordinate with or donate money to candidates. Let’s start with 2011 and 2012 -- that is, the 2012 election cycle. 2012 election cycle The center reports that, as Baldwin indicated, more than $308 million in dark money was spent during the entire 2012 election cycle. Some 86 percent was spent by conservative groups, 11 percent by liberal groups and 3 percent by other groups. The most -- $71 million -- was spent by American Crossroads/Crossroads GPS, which was co-founded by Rove. Americans for Prosperity, founded in part by the billionaire brothers David and Charles Koch, was second ($36 million) and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce was third ($35 million). The three leading liberal groups, as identified by the center, were the League of Conservation Voters ($11 million), Patriot Majority USA ($7 million), whose priorities include money for public schools and infrastructure, and Planned Parenthood (nearly $7 million). 2016 cycle As for the 2016 cycle, $4.88 million in dark money expenditures have already been made, according to the center. That’s more than 10 times the $440,000 that was spent at this point during the 2012 cycle. The $4.88 million has been spent by six groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce ($3 million) and Americans for Prosperity ($1.5 million), The only liberal group was Planned Parenthood, which spent just under $75,000 Richard Skinner, policy analyst at the Sunlight Foundation, told us that the focus of early dark money being spent in the 2016 cycle is on U.S. Senate elections that are considered to be competitive, though some is also being spent on U.S. House races. (Baldwin isn’t up for election again until 2018. But Wisconsin’s other senator, Republican Ron Johnson, is rated as being in a "pure toss-up" race in 2016 from Democrat Russ Feingold, whom Johnson defeated in 2010. No dark money has been spent yet in that race, according to the Sunlight Foundation.) Skinner said he didn’t know whether dark money spending so far means that the total for the 2016 cycle will ultimately be 10 times higher than four years earlier. But he said he expects more dark money to spent in the 2016 cycle than ever before. Our rating Baldwin said "dark money spending" in the 2016 election cycle "is 10 times what it was at the same point in the 2012 election cycle," when it topped $308 million. So-called dark money spending in election campaigns -- by groups that don’t have to disclose their donors -- exceeded $308 million in the 2012 election cycle. So far in the 2016 cycle, it has reached nearly $5 million, more than 10 times the $440,000 that had been spent at this point in the 2012 cycle. We rate Baldwin’s statement True.

Page 50: All non-US citizens, illegal or not, will be provided with free health care services." Most of the e-mail's claims are wrong, and you can read our extended analysis to find out why. One of its most bizarre claims is the one about free health care for noncitizens, "illegal or not." We read the bill and its legislative summary, and could find nothing about free health care for anyone, much less noncitizens. To confirm our examination, we turned to Jennifer Tolbert, an independent health care analyst at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan foundation that studies health care reform. Tolbert has read and analyzed all the major health proposals, including those of the Republicans, and the foundation provides point-by-point analyses of the plans on its Web site. "No one's provided with free health care. That's ridiculous," she said. Page 50, which the e-mail references, is part of Section 152, which includes a generic nondiscrimination clause saying that insurers may not discriminate with regard to "personal characteristics extraneous to the provision of high quality health care or related services." The section says nothing about "non-US citizens" or immigrants, legal or otherwise. In fact, the legislation specifically states that "undocumented aliens" will not be eligible for credits to help them buy health insurance, in Section 246 on page 143. The bottom line here is the e-mail is making things up. The bill does not say anything close to "All non-US citizens, illegal or not, will be provided with free health care services."

pomt-06568	"We have had over 40 days this summer where it was unsafe to breathe the air."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2011/sep/30/jennette-gayer/how-dangerous-it-breathe-atlanta-air/	For many Atlanta-area residents, 2011 will be remembered as the long, hot -- no, veryhot -- summer. The high temperature climbed past 90 degrees on 66 days this summer, according to the National Weather Service. Officials warned it was dangerously hot on some days. How dangerous was it to be outside, you ask? "We have had over 40 days this summer where it was unsafe to breathe the air," said Jennette Gayer, staff advocate for Georgia Environment, a group with goals of protecting the state’s air, water and natural resources. The claim surprised us since we’ve seen no widespread reports of Georgians being hospitalized or claiming harm from breathing. We thought we’d check this out. Gayer made the statement during a recent meeting at Atlanta City Hall. She was there to speak out about the proposed 1 percent sales tax to pay for about 150 transportation projects in the Atlanta region. A referendum is scheduled for July 2012. Gayer’s remarks to the packed audience of about 200 people in the City Council chamber were focused on her desire to see more projects she thinks may improve air quality, such as a commuter rail line between Atlanta and Griffin. "[W]e need ... more alternatives to cars," Gayer told us in an email. Gayer based her comments on the state Department of Natural Resources, which monitors air quality in the Atlanta region from 10 different locations. The state uses federal guidelines to measure the level of carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone (at ground level) and sulfur dioxide. The state sets a ratings scale, green for "good" to purple for "very unhealthy." Some observers contend the ratings are based on flawed conclusions about the impact of pollutants on the environment. Susan Zimmer-Dauphinee, who is in charge of running the state’s monitoring system, said there have been 38 days this year where air quality levels were labeled as "unhealthy" or "code orange." The unhealthy rating is primarily for groups such as young children, the elderly and those with asthma or other respiratory conditions. So is it stretching the truth to say there have been 40 days this summer when it was "unsafe" to breathe the air because the code orange doesn’t include all groups? "The young, the elderly and people with existing respiratory problems would definitely be most impacted, but more and more research is pointing to even healthy adults experiencing problems," Gayer said. Gayer believes the current air quality standards should be strengthened, pointing to arguments from some scientists who lobbied the federal Environmental Protection Agency on that point. The Obama administration earlier this month reversed course on some clean air regulations aimed at reducing smog. Some congressional leaders worried the tougher air quality standards would hurt businesses in the struggling economy. Arthur Winer, former director of UCLA’s Environmental Science and Engineering Program, said Gayer could have been more precise. "In general, the air quality standards and health alerts are focused on the most vulnerable populations, rather than the general public," said Winer, who says he has written more than 200 journal articles and book chapters on air pollution and related topics over the past 30 years. "However, to be rigorous, it would probably have been better if this person had said ‘there were 40 days this summer in which it was unsafe to breathe the air for small children, the elderly and people with respiratory illnesses like asthma.’ " To be more technical, the state’s chart shows 18 of those days were in May and early June, before the official start of summer. Gayer said she based her comments at the meeting on Atlanta’s smog season, which begins May 1 and ends Sept. 30. Gayer’s comment was generally accurate -- with an emphasis on generally. But it also leaves out some key details. We rate it Half True.	None	Jennette Gayer	None	None	None	2011-09-30T06:00:00	2011-09-15	['None']
pomt-06009	Says she got unions to agree to "about $10 million in reduction" of salaries and health benefits while serving as Dane County executive in Wisconsin.	true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jan/18/kathleen-falk/possible-recall-challenger-wisconsin-gov-scott-wal/	Bracing for a likely recall election in 2012, Republican Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker tells voters in a TV ad that he saved them "hundreds of millions of dollars" by making public employees pay more toward their pensions and health insurance. In contrast, one of Walker’s potential challengers, Democrat Kathleen Falk, was asked on a Milwaukee public affairs show that aired Jan. 8, 2012 whether she worries about being perceived as "the public employee union candidate." Mike Gousha, host of the WISN-TV show, posed the question after alluding to a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel report that said two state union leaders tried to help clear the Democratic field for Falk by discouraging Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett from running in a recall. Falk, who resigned from her post as Dane County executive in April 2011, answered Gousha by saying she’d had her own success in Madison in curbing public employee costs. "Well, you know what I've done as the county executive for 14 years," said Falk. "When times got tough, I sat down with eight unions and bargained about $10 million in reduction of their salaries and health benefits by them, voluntarily at the collective bargaining table, agreeing to that." Falk was drawing a pointed contrast. She used collective bargaining with unions to achieve savings on employee costs, while Walker and the Republican-controlled Legislature used legislation to force most state and local employees to pay more for benefits. But let’s check Falk’s more specific claim -- that she reduced salaries and health benefits of Dane County employees by about $10 million. We asked Falk spokeswoman Melissa Mulliken for evidence. She provided comments attributed to Dane County director of administration Travis Myren that detailed $9.4 million in reductions, so we decided to contact him directly. Myren has been director of administration since being promoted from deputy director by Falk in April 2009. Myren said the $9.4 million in savings were the result of three Falk initiatives that were agreed to by public employee unions and then applied to non-union employees, so that all 2,200 county workers were covered. He also cited a fourth agreement that would put the savings over $10 million. 2009: Temporary pay cut -- $3.6 million Falk and the employee unions agreed to cut wages 5 percent for six months, saving $3.6 million. The deal was approved by the county Board of Supervisors in June 2009. In exchange, employees got 48 additional hours of "personal leave" time -- paid time off that had to be taken within certain deadlines. The only way that could create a cost to the county is if employees used that additional leave instead of vacation days, banked those unused vacation days and then were paid in cash for them upon terminating their employment with the county, Myren said. He said there is no way to estimate how much, if any, such payouts the county might one day make. So, the county saved $3.6 million with the 2009 pay cut, though it could face some higher cash payouts for vacation days down the road. 2010: Temporary pay cut -- $4.7 million After the 5 percent pay cut expired, putting salaries back at their previous level, Falk and the unions agreed to cut pay 3 percent for one year, saving $4.7 million. That deal was approved by the County Board in December 2009. In exchange, the county agreed to no layoffs in 2010 and a number of other benefit enhancements, including 64 more hours of personal leave; increasing by 50 the number of hours employees can bank in sick leave, which can be used to buy health insurance after retirement; and senior employees got three extra vacation days per year. So, although the county granted some benefit improvements, it saved another $4.7 million in salaries with the 2010 pay cut. 2011: Health insurance changes -- $1.1 million A new employee contract for 2012 through 2014 require employees to pay more for their health benefits. For example, a co-pay for doctor office visits was created and higher deductibles are imposed for certain services. The changes were approved by the County Board in January 2011. Myren said the changes reduced the county’s premiums by $900,000 and the additional employee contributions are projected to save another $200,000, for a total savings of $1.1 million for 2012. In exchange, the county agreed to remove a cap on the pension contributions it makes for employees -- potentially exposing the county to higher pension costs through 2014. Pension funding for Wisconsin public employees is somewhat complicated. A formula, which changes annually, determines what percentage of an employee’s salary is to be contributed to the pension by the employer and what percentage by the employee. However, Dane County, as many public employers in Wisconsin have long done, makes both contributions; in 2011, the employee portion was 5.8 percent of the employee’s salary. Under the 2012-2014 contract, the county agreed to eliminate a 6.5 percent cap on the employee contribution that was in the previous contract. So, if the pension funding formula changes and puts the employee contribution higher than 6.5 percent, the county would have a higher pension cost than under the previous contract. State pension figures show the employee contribution for most public employees -- including all non-elected Dane County employees -- was 5 percent from 1989 through 2011, but that it rose to 5.9 percent in 2012 after the Walker-led legislation took effect. Starting in 2015, after the current contract ends, Dane County employees will be subject to the Walker-led collective bargaining legislation and will be forced to contribute to their pensions. So, the county is exposing itself to potentially higher pension costs through 2014 in exchange for $1.1 million in immediate health insurance savings. "Voluntary leave without pay" program The two pay cuts and the health insurance savings total $9.4 million in reductions in salaries and health benefits -- or, more precisely, the cost of health benefits. That’s just short of the "about $10 million" claimed by Falk. But Myren said another Falk initiative negotiated with the unions -- "voluntary leaves" -- also should be considered. Voluntary leaves -- which differ from personal leaves in that they are days off without pay -- were created in 2003. Through 2011, personal leaves saved the county $1.45 million, Myren said. That would put the total Falk-led employee savings at nearly $11 million. We ran all of this past two of Falk’s political foes on the Dane County Board, supervisors Eileen Bruskewitz and Ronn Ferrell. They described Falk as a friend of public employee unions, pointing out that under the current contract she negotiated, union employees got 3 percent raises at the end of 2011; and that, unlike other local governments, the county can't use until 2015 the Walker legislation to put a greater share of health and pension costs onto employees. But they didn’t dispute the fact that her agreements with the unions saved about $10 million. Our conclusion Falk said she used collective bargaining to reduce Dane County employee salaries and health benefits by "about $10 million." The deals create the possibility that the county will have higher payouts for pensions and vacations in future years, but that is not certain. What is known is that the deals have saved the county more than $10 million in salaries and health benefit costs. We rate Falk’s statement True.

pomt-00921	"In general, it appears" Wisconsin’s right to work bill would "likely apply to" the Green Bay Packers players and their union.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/feb/27/jon-erpenbach/would-wisconsins-right-work-bill-affect-green-bay-/	On Feb. 23, 2015, the night before a hearing that would draw some 2,000 protesters to Madison, state Sen. Jon Erpenbach (D-Middleton) added intrigue to what was already a quarrelsome issue: so-called right to work legislation. Erpenbach, who opposes a Wisconsin right-to-work bill introduced earlier the same day, did a Facebook posting that raised this question: Would the bill -- the object of scorn among some employee unions but almost certain to become law -- affect the beloved Green Bay Packers? As we found in an analysis of polling on right to work, there is a general lack of knowledge among the public about right-to-work laws, which block companies and workers from signing labor contracts that require employees to pay union dues. Of course, in contrast, most folks in Wisconsin know an awful lot about, and have plenty of passion for, the Packers. Indeed, one of the Capitol protesters carried a sign that read: "R-T-W Kills The Green Bay Packers Union." So, is Erpenbach right? Let's start by noting that players for the Green Bay Packers and the other National Football League teams must join the NFL Players Association. (Although, like members of similar unions, they can request refunds for the portion of their dues that are used for political purposes, as opposed to the cost of operating the union.) Under Wisconsin’s right-to-work bill, which Gov. Scott Walker has said he would sign, the Packers players could opt not to join the union. Erpenbach's Facebook posting was a two-paragraph memo written by an attorney with the Wisconsin Legislative Council about the Republican-backed right to work bill. The council is a nonpartisan state agency that responds to legal and policy research questions from lawmakers. "Sen. Erpenbach asked whether these provisions of the bill apply to employees of professional sports teams in Wisconsin, such as the Green Bay Packers, and the labor organizations representing those employees," the memo concluded. "In general, it appears that the provisions likely apply to such employees and labor organizations." The author of the memo, Jessica Karls-Ruplinger, confirmed to us that that was her conclusion. And Marquette University law professor Paul Secunda, who directs the law school’s labor and employment law program, told us he agrees that the bill would apply to pro athletes and their unions. But Secunda, a self-described vocal opponent of right to work and an avid sports fan, said he believes the Wisconsin measure would hurt many Wisconsin workers. But it is "likely not to have impact on professional sport unions," he said. That's true for several reasons, he said: Those unions are small and their solidarity is strong; union dues are a tiny percentage of player salaries; the unions have won many things for players, such as pensions and minimum salaries; Moreover, even in long-term right-to-work states such as Georgia, there have never been instances of players on a wide scale opting not to pay union dues. A spokesman for the NFL Players Association, which is part of the AFL-CIO, didn’t respond to our calls. The union did issue a statement opposing the bill, saying "devoted food and commercial workers who spend their Sundays servicing our players and fans at Lambeau Field will have their well-being and livelihood jeopardized by right to work." And in an interview with the Capital Times of Madison, the union’s executive director, DeMaurice Smith, also didn’t raise such concerns. Twelve of the NFL's 32 teams are in states that have right-to-work laws, which means players in those states can't be compelled to pay union dues to keep their job, the article said. But Smith said that hasn't been a significant issue for the union, according to the article. (Unions representing Major League Baseball and the National Hockey League each issued statements that echoed the views of the NFLPA. But like the NFLPA statement, neither expressed concerns for the players unions themselves.) Erpenbach, meanwhile, told us he requested the memo because most of the discussion about Wisconsin’s right to work bill had centered on trade unions and he wondered if it would apply to pro athletes. But the lawmaker acknowledged he didn't know whether the bill would have any practical effects on the Packers players or their union. Our rating Erpenbach said: "In general, it appears" Wisconsin’s right to work bill would "likely apply to" the Green Bay Packers players and their union. The nonpartisan state Legislative Council arrived at that conclusion -- though, as a practical matter, it’s not clear the bill would have any noticeable effect on the players union. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True. ------ More on Scott Walker For profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Scott Walker page.

pomt-03189	Half of Oregon university students are on Pell Grants.	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2013/aug/31/jim-francesconi/are-half-oregon-university-students-pell-grants/	As a member of the Oregon State Board of Higher Education, former Portland city Commissioner Jim Francesconi recently wrote a guest column on the importance of a university degree. He urged more public and private support of low-income students going to college. We’ve already checked one of the statistics Francesconi cited in his column, about the percentage of poor children in Oregon. Now, we turn to an assertion about Pell grants, the federal program for financially needy students. "Education after high school is the way, but it is out of reach for many children, especially in rural Oregon. Nearly half of Oregon's children are poor. Half of Oregon university students are on Pell Grants. The average student debt is more than $25,000." We figured this would be a straightforward check: Are half of Oregon university students receiving Pell grants? The Federal Pell Grant Program helps undergraduate students with money awards that don’t have to be paid back. According to the U.S. Department of Education, the maximum award for the 2013-14 school year is $5,645. Nationally, more than 9 million students received Pell aid in 2011-12. Pell grants can be an indication of how well a university fares in educating and graduating students from across the economic spectrum. We assume that Francesconi is speaking of students in the Oregon University System, as he is a board member writing about the importance of making state universities accessible to residents. We’re also thinking that he’s limiting himself even further to students who graduate from Oregon high schools. More on that later. We turned to our trusty "OUS Fact Book," which gives details of Oregon’s seven public universities. There were nearly 85,500 undergraduates counted in fall 2012.There were nearly 28,900 students who received Pell grants in 2012-13. Our calculator tells us that’s 34 percent, not half. We checked with College Insight, affiliated with the Institute for College Access & Success, for a national take. For 2010-11, it says 31 percent of undergraduates at Oregon’s four-year public universities received Pell grants. That’s higher than in Washington, which is at 25 percent, and lower than in California, which reports that roughly 42 percent of undergraduates at public universities received Pell grants. Nationally, the statistic is 34 percent. In any case, 31 percent or 34 percent is not 50 percent. What gives? We turned to the university system, and its data expert Bob Kieran, who is Assistant Vice Chancellor for Institutional Research and Planning at Oregon University System. Kieran said Francesconi is accurate because, in 2010-11, the university system awarded bachelor’s degrees to more than 11,100 Oregonians. More than 5,500 of those graduates had received Pell grant money at some point in college. That’s just about half. "Half our undergraduates are not necessarily receiving a Pell award in any given term or year, but half of the Oregonians receiving a bachelor’s degree have benefited from a Pell award during their academic program within OUS," Kieran wrote in an initial email. Francesconi confirmed using the statistic cited by Kieran to back up his statement. "Half of students are on Pell Grants during their college years and I will leave it to you and your readers to determine the significance of the difference," Francesconi wrote in an email to PolitiFact Oregon. We admit it. We were really confused. To us, that 50 percent of students who graduated in one year relied on Pell grants sometime during college is not the same thing as saying that 50 percent of Oregon university students are on Pell grants at any given time. Those are different measurements. Francesconi’s statement, at this point, was not accurate. The Fact Book numbers didn’t show he was right, and the statistic he relied on did not prove his statement right. We persisted. In a follow-up email, Kieran then explained that the 34 percent Pell grant figure is inaccurate because it’s based on a larger universe of students, including those from abroad or out of state. He said we should focus on Oregon residents since the gist of Francesconi’s op-ed is to encourage ways to help Oregon students thrive in higher education. That number, he said, is this: In fall 2012, nearly 25,000 of nearly 55,000 resident undergraduates enrolled received Pell grants. That’s 45 percent -- which is much closer to 50 percent. We asked Kieran to calculate for previous years. In 2007, 30 percent of resident undergraduates were on Pell grants; in 2010, the figure was 43 percent and in 2011, 45 percent. As you can see, nearing the 50 percent mark is a recent development. A side note here. We don’t doubt Francesconi’s sincerity in urging greater investment in public education. Still, we think it important to get the numbers right when making a point. For example, Francesconi also wrote that the average student graduates with $25,000 in debt. That would only apply to the 59 percent of students who graduate with debt. We know because we checked a similar statement by Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., and another higher education board member pointed out that 41 percent of OUS students graduate with no debt. Now, we return to our regular program. Francesconi said that half of Oregon university students are needy enough to be on Pell grants. This is within the ballpark of accurate if you limit the count to Oregon residents at Oregon’s public universities. And we can accept these qualifiers given the overall thrust of his guest column -- even as we find the original explanation provided by the speaker and university system to be seriously flawed. Last year’s snapshot figures show that 45 percent of Oregon resident undergraduates were on Pell grants, up from 30 percent in 2007. The Oregon University System eventually unearthed statistics to back up Francesconi’s statement, making it accurate but requiring clarification and additional information. We rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Jim Francesconi	None	None	None	2013-08-31T06:00:00	2013-08-07	['Oregon']
pomt-14848	Climate change is "directly related" to the growth of terrorism.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/16/bernie-sanders/fact-checking-bernie-sanders-comments-climate-chan/	The Democratic debate in Iowa began with a moment of silence for the victims of the Paris terror attacks before pivoting to a discussion on how to address terrorism. Bernie Sanders, who vowed to "rid our planet" of ISIS in his opening statement, also said at a previous debate that the greatest threat to national security is climate change. A day after the terrorist attacks, did he, asked moderator John Dickerson, still believe that? "Absolutely. In fact, climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism," Sanders said on Nov. 14. "If we do not get our act together and listen to what the scientists say, you’re gonna see countries all over the world — this is what the CIA says — they’re going to be struggling over limited amounts of water, limited amounts of land to grow their crops, and you’re going to see all kinds of international conflict." A day later on CBS’ Face the Nation, Sanders doubled down on his statement, elaborating, "When people migrate into cities and they don't have jobs, there's going to be a lot more instability, a lot more unemployment, and people will be subject to the types of propaganda that al-Qaida and ISIS are using right now." We were curious about the link between climate change and terrorism that Sanders highlighted. While there is a body of literature backing his broader point that climate change contributes to the growth of terrorism, Sanders is overstating the "direct" connection. A complicated relationship The Sanders camp referred us to statements from President Barack Obama and leaders of the defense community, as well as a Defense Department report that suggests indirect links between climate change and terrorism: • Obama in a May 2015 speech: "Understand, climate change did not cause the conflicts we see around the world. Yet what we also know is that severe drought helped to create the instability in Nigeria that was exploited by the terrorist group Boko Haram." • The Defense Department in a 2014 report: "In our defense strategy, we refer to climate change as a ‘threat multiplier’ because it has the potential to exacerbate many of the challenges we are dealing with today — from infectious disease to terrorism. We are already beginning to see some of these impacts." • Adm. Samuel J. Locklear, then-commander of the U.S. Pacific Command, said in 2013 that the significant upheaval related to the warming planet "is probably the most likely thing that is going to happen … that will cripple the security environment." We found a few other federal and academic reports naming climate change a threat to national security, but that’s not the same thing as "directly related to the growth of terrorism." That’s not to say that climate change isn’t contributing to existing problems. Democratic presidential candidate Martin O’Malley used more accurate language when he said, "One of the things that preceded the failure of the nation-state of Syria and the rise of ISIS was the effect of climate change and the mega-drought that affected that region, wiped out farmers, drove people to cities, created a humanitarian crisis." We rated his comments Mostly True. Sanders was more sweeping in his comments, though. "I wouldn’t have said it as strongly, but (climate change) is an accelerant to conflict and helps produce instability," said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the national security think tank the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. "Within the national security sphere, more and more see climate change as a real problem. They would agree with the broader point." Climate change, however, is not "hermetically sealed from other risks," writes Francesco Femia and Caitlin Werrell of the Center for Climate and Security in a blog post. "The impacts of climate change interact with other factors to make existing security risks worse." That’s why experts and the Pentagon prefer the term "threat multiplier." Here’s how: Climate change can lead to food and water scarcity, which may in turn increase poverty, the spread of disease, and mass migration — in short, instability. In places with already weakened governments, this breeds the conditions for terrorism to thrive. Factors that contribute to terrorism Of course, there are myriad conditions that motivate terrorism. Ideology and political interests are much more direct factors, according to Michael Doran, who served on the National Security Council and in the Defense Department under President George W. Bush. The latest Global Terrorism Index report lists political, nationalist and separatist movements as well as weak political systems and a lack of political legitimacy as main drivers. It found that countries with high levels of terrorism share three "statistically significant factors": • Hostility between different ethnic, religious and linguistic groups; • State-sponsored violence such as extrajudicial killings, political terrors and high levels of group grievances; • Violence from organized conflict, demonstrations and crime, and perceptions of criminality. According to the Global Terrorism report, 66 percent of deaths from terrorist attacks in 2013 were caused by four extremist groups: ISIS, Boko Haram, the Taliban and al-Qaida. Their commonality is, obviously, religious extremism. Our ruling Sanders said, "Climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism." We couldn’t find any evidence of a "direct" relationship between climate change and terrorism, though many reports have noted an indirect link. There are, of course, many other factors that contribute to terrorism, including religious and ethnic tensions and political repression. We rate Sanders' claim Mostly False.

pomt-00366	Says Beto O’Rourke's campaign "told Texas VFW to remove their American flag" because O'Rourke has "an aversion to the American flag and symbols of patriotism."	mostly false	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/sep/12/blog-posting/orourke-campaign-request-remove-american-flag-rall/	Two people asked to take down the American and Texas flags before a campaign rally in Navasota, Texas, but whether they were with the candidate’s campaign is unclear. Democratic Rep. Beto O’Rourke held a town hall at the Navasota Veterans of Foreign Wars post on Aug. 25. O’Rourke is looking to unseat one-term incumbent and 2016 presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz in the 2018 midterm election. The Navasota Examiner article about the rally quoted the VFW post commander Carl Dry about a request he says he received while the O’Rourke campaign was setting up for the event. "They wanted to open the doors (to the Flight Deck Lounge), and I couldn’t allow that, and they wanted to take the flags down. I didn’t only say no, I said hell no, you don’t take the flags off the wall," Dry is quoted saying in the newspaper. "I can’t believe any American would ask us to do that, and I don’t know why he wanted them down or what he was going to put up instead." Websites such as TopStoriesUSA.com picked up Dry’s quote in early September, saying that the O’Rourke campaign had made the flag removal request and that the request showed a theme of the campaign’s "aversion to the American flag" and patriotic symbols. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its newsfeed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) TopStoriesUSA.com editor Vic Medina attributed the content of the site’s story "Beto O’Rourke Campaign told Texas VFW to remove their American flag" to The Examiner report. "Dry does not identify specifically who on O'Rourke's campaign made the request, or if O'Rourke himself made the request of him," Medina said. The O’Rourke campaign didn't respond to our inquiry, but the campaign has denied making the request to remove the flags before the rally. "Our campaign absolutely did not request that any flags be removed or taken down from the walls," campaign spokesman Chris Evans wrote in an email to the Bryan-College Station Eagle newspaper. "It is incorrect to say that we did. We have hosted dozens of town halls in VFW posts across the state, and always ensure that the flags are prominently and respectfully displayed." Dry told us two people, about 10 minutes apart, asked him to remove the American and Texas flags before the event. He said they were not wearing name tags or other identifiers related to the O’Rourke campaign. Dry said he assumed the two individuals were part of the campaign because they came to him from the room where the event was being held and returned to it after he told the first "no," and the second "hell, no." "I had to assume they were Mr. O’Rourke’s campaign people," Dry said. "Whether they were or not, I don’t know. I did not ask." The TopStoriesUSA.com story also speculates that "there seems to be an aversion to the American flag and symbols of patriotism" with O’Rourke’s campaign and that the event "was attracting some that might have been offended to see the American and Texas flags on display behind O’Rourke." O’Rourke’s campaign is not distancing itself from the American flag. The most prominent image on the campaign website’s homepage is a photo of O’Rourke, with the American flag behind him. He performed at a July 4 concert this year with Willie Nelson in front of the flag. There are also numerous photos and videos on social media of him speaking in front of the American and Texas flags from other events this summer. It’s not unreasonable to assume, as Dry did, that the people who asked to "take down" the American flags at the Aug. 25 rally were from the O’Rourke campaign. But it is an assumption, and furthermore it’s not clear why they were asking: It’s possible they wanted to move them to another location or feature them in some other way. We can say that the campaign definitely does not show an "aversion" to the flag or to patriotic symbols, as it has used them in many other settings. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-09706	Research shows the employer mandate in the House health reform bill would "place millions 'at substantial risk of unemployment' — with minority workers losing their jobs at twice the rate of their white counterparts."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/04/house-republicans/republicans-study-employer-mandate-health/	A few months ago, a chain e-mail purporting to be a line-by-line analysis of the House health care reform bill reached in-boxes all over the country, warning people of the dire consequences of the Democratic plans for reform. Taking a page from the same playbook, the House Republican Conference has created a similar list for the new health care bill that will be coming to the House floor in the next few weeks. You can read our fact-check of the Republican analysis in its entirety. Here, we're looking only at the statement, "Page 313 - Section 512 imposes an 8 percent 'tax on jobs' for firms that cannot afford to purchase 'bureaucrat-approved' health coverage; according to an analysis by Harvard Professor Kate Baicker, such a tax would place millions 'at substantial risk of unemployment'—with minority workers losing their jobs at twice the rate of their white counterparts." This point refers to the House bill's employer mandate, which requires large employers to offer health insurance for their workers. (This is a major difference with the Senate bill, which is not expected to include an employer mandate.) So the House bill does tax employers that don't offer insurance. The Republicans say that Baicker's research shows that millions would be at risk for unemployment, and her research does show that. But the number of people who would actually lose their jobs, according to her projections, is much smaller. Baicker and co-author Helen Levy identified workers who lacked insurance and whose wages are so close to the minimum wage that employers will not be able to reduce their pay in order to pay for health insurance. That pool of uninsured, low-wage workers is 5.5 million. Of those, however, she concluded that a much smaller number — 224,284 — were "likely" to lose their jobs. And about 136,342 were likely to be racial and ethnic minorities, she concluded. Baicker and Levy also wrote that those numbers would be fewer if small employers were exempt from the mandate. And the House bill does just that: It exempts employers with a payroll of less than $500,000. We contacted Baicker, who also added the following note of clarification: "Our estimates were done years ago and were meant to model a stylized mandate policy, not any of the actual policies under consideration at the moment. The effect on employment will be driven by a lot of the details, such as which workers are included based on number of hours worked and which firms are included based on firm size." So the House Republican Conference takes a study that looked at a general policy, not the details of the current House bill. Additionally, the exemption for small employers would reduce the number of workers who would be at risk for losing their jobs. So we rate this statement Half True.

pomt-13784	Says Donald Trump "always pays his bills promptly."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/20/phil-ruffin/businessman-friend-donald-trump-says-he-always-pay/	Phil Ruffin, a Las Vegas casino magnate, took to the podium at the Republican National Convention on July 20 on behalf of his friend and business associate Donald Trump. At one point in his address, Ruffin said of Trump, "He always pays his bills promptly. You won't hear that. Promptly, no discounts." However, that assertion clashes with an extensive investigation by USA Today, which ran a story in June headlined, "Hundreds allege Donald Trump doesn’t pay his bills." Here’s the crux of that USA Today story: "(We) found he has been involved in more than 3,500 lawsuits over the past three decades — and a large number of those involve ordinary Americans … who say Trump or his companies have refused to pay them. "At least 60 lawsuits, along with hundreds of liens, judgments, and other government filings reviewed by the USA Today Network, document people who have accused Trump and his businesses of failing to pay them for their work. Among them: a dishwasher in Florida. A glass company in New Jersey. A carpet company. A plumber. Painters. Forty-eight waiters. Dozens of bartenders and other hourly workers at his resorts and clubs, coast to coast. Real estate brokers who sold his properties. And, ironically, several law firms that once represented him in these suits and others. ... "The actions in total paint a portrait of Trump’s sprawling organization frequently failing to pay small businesses and individuals, then sometimes tying them up in court and other negotiations for years. In some cases, the Trump teams financially overpower and outlast much smaller opponents, draining their resources. Some just give up the fight, or settle for less; some have ended up in bankruptcy or out of business altogether." One example alleged by USA Today was that of Philadelphia cabinet-builder Edward Friel Jr., who had a $400,000 contract with Trump to build several types of furniture for his casinos in Atlantic City in the 1980s. "The family cabinetry business, founded in the 1940s by Edward’s father, finished its work in 1984 and submitted its final bill to the general contractor for the Trump Organization, the resort’s builder," USA Today reported. "Edward’s son, Paul, who was the firm’s accountant, still remembers the amount of that bill more than 30 years later: $83,600. The reason: the money never came. ‘That began the demise of the Edward J. Friel Company … which has been around since my grandfather,’ he said." Trump and his daughter Ivanka spoke to USA Today for the story, saying that if someone wasn’t paid fully, it was because Trump or his executives were dissatisfied with the work. "Let’s say that they do a job that’s not good, or a job that they didn’t finish, or a job that was way late. I’ll deduct from their contract, absolutely," Trump told USA Today. "That’s what the country should be doing." Trump also acknowledged to Reuters that he sometimes "renegotiates" with vendors. "I'll do that with probably 10 or 15 percent of contractors," he told Reuters. USA Today noted that "Trump and his companies have prevailed in many legal disputes over missing payments, or reached settlements that cloud the terms reached by the parties." However, the newspaper added that some cases are of recent vintage. "Just last month, Trump Miami Resort Management LLC settled with 48 servers at his Miami golf resort over failing to pay overtime for a special event," the newspaper wrote. "The settlements averaged about $800 for each worker and as high as $3,000 for one, according to court records." Neither the Trump campaign nor a public relations firm for one of Ruffin’s properties, the Treasure Island casino in Las Vegas, replied to a request for comment for this article. We should note that Ruffin’s prepared remarks differ in a small but important way. According to prepared remarks distributed by the Trump campaign shortly before his speech, Ruffin was supposed to say, "I believed in him, and for three tough years we worked together to keep (their joint project) afloat. Through it all, Donald always paid his bills promptly, with no discounts." The italicized sentence from the prepared remarks refers specifically to Ruffin’s personal dealings with Trump on their project in Las Vegas -- a much narrower universe of business dealings than the sweeping statement Ruffin actually offered from the podium in Cleveland. In a case like this, PolitiFact considers the spoken words to be more important, since they are heard by millions of people on live television. And they are contradicted by the USA Today report. Our ruling Ruffin said that Donald Trump "always pays his bills promptly." But the USA Today investigation found a large number of lawsuits -- at least 60, plus hundreds of liens, judgments and other filings -- because people have accused Trump of failing to pay for services rendered or products delivered. The complaints even come from law firms that had formerly represented Trump in these types of lawsuits. "Always" is a strong word, so if even just a tiny fraction of the cases uncovered by USA Today are accurate, that would be enough to make Ruffin’s statement incorrect. We rate the statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5f7a5f4d-5f98-461a-9616-33d2d48c26df	None	Phil Ruffin	None	None	None	2016-07-20T21:51:19	2016-07-20	['None']
pomt-11905	On preserving 60-vote threshold to end a Senate filibuster.	full flop	/texas/statements/2017/oct/20/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-flip-flops-60-senate-votes-end-filibuster/	U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, famous and infamous for his 2013 filibuster-like talk-a-thon that included his reading a Dr. Seuss story to his daughters watching from home, no longer favors preserving a rule that makes it hard to stop filibusters. Did the Texas senator flip-flop? We inquired. In the 100-person Senate, a filibuster (from a Dutch word meaning pirate) can’t be broken unless the senator in the spotlight gives way or foes raise 60 votes to invoke "cloture," bringing debate to a close. Senators set that threshold, which breaks out to a three-fifths majority, in 1975. For decades before, according to a Senate web page, it had taken a two-thirds vote to invoke cloture. Cruz, a Republican lawyer, said in 2015 he wouldn’t support elimination of the 60-vote hurdle--even to advance his goal of repealing the Obamacare law put in place by Democrats. According to a Roll Call news story, Cruz initially told Heritage Action’s Jan. 12, 2015, policy summit that Republicans should do "everything humanly possible to repeal Obamacare." But, the story said, Cruz said afterward he believed Senate Republicans, while in the majority, shouldn’t eliminate the filibuster as a tactic to get more legislation to then-President Barack Obama. "No, we should not," Cruz said. "We should preserve the procedural protections in the Senate for the rights of the minority." Cruz then borrowed an analogy used by the framers of the Constitution by saying the Senate is "like the saucer under the tea cup to cool deliberations, and I think those checks and balances were inspired. And one of the ways to limit rash decision-making is the requirement in the Senate of a 60-vote threshold to overcome a filibuster." In September 2017, though, according to a Texas Tribune news story, Cruz said at a Texas tea-party forum that he’s changed his mind and now favors an end to the 60-vote threshold to end a filibuster. At the forum, the story says, Cruz was asked whether, like President Donald Trump, he supports ending the filibuster rule. The story said Cruz called for ending the filibuster rule, acknowledging it is an "issue on which I’ve changed my mind over the last five years." We asked Cruz spokesman Phil Novack if Cruz’s position had changed. Yes, Novack replied, pointing us by email to a Facebook-posted video of the Sept. 30, 2017, NE Tarrant Tea Party meeting where Cruz was asked about eliminating the 60-vote threshold. At the meeting, Cruz replied, to applause: "Long and short out of it, I would end the 60-vote filibuster right now." His answer went on: "Now let me give you some context on that because that’s actually an issue on which I’ve changed my mind over the last five years. "So if you’d asked me five years ago, I would have had a different answer. And the reason is as follows: I think over time, the 60-vote threshold for legislation has had a small ‘c’ conservative effect in that it has slowed down the operation of Congress. Since World War II, we’ve had three Democratic super-majorities: the first gave us the New Deal; the second gave us the Great Society; the third gave us Obamacare and Dodd-Frank. "So, getting rid of the filibuster means any time there’s a Democratic majority, you have a Democratic supermajority. So a lot of bad legislation would pass without the 60-vote threshold. So, if you’d asked me five years ago, I would have said no, I don’t think we should get rid of it because it slows down bad legislation at a time when the Democrats are in control. "Why have I changed my mind? Because I don’t believe Democrats will be bound by it. I ...think the next time the Democrats have a majority, particularly with a Democratic president, I think they’ll end the filibuster in a hurry. So if I believed it were a credible threat, that it actually would restrain Democrats in the future, then I might well support keeping it now. I don’t." Cruz’s reply closed with a comment including a word we couldn’t make out: "I think it’s stupid that it’s a one-way (unintelligible), that it only limits us, it doesn’t limit them." Our ruling Cruz once favored keeping the 60-vote requirement to end a Senate filibuster. He no longer does. On the PolitiFact Flip-O-Meter, that’s a FULL FLOP. Full Flop A major reversal of position; a complete flip-flop. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Ted Cruz	None	None	None	2017-10-20T17:21:54	2017-09-30	['None']
pomt-06354	Says "over the last 48 years, every governor at the midterm of his first term or her first term has lost seats in the Legislature, with the exception of Jim McGreevey in 2003."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/nov/06/chris-christie/chris-christie-says-nearly-every-governor-more-48-/	Even if nothing changes, Tuesday’s election would be a historic win for Republicans. Gov. Chris Christie said in a recent radio interview that decades of history show governors lose seats in their first midterm election. But he said this year will be different. "Over the last 48 years, every governor at the midterm of his first term or her first term has lost seats in the Legislature, with the exception of Jim McGreevey in 2003, who was working off a newly gerrymandered map," Christie said Oct. 26 on WCBS 880 AM. Christie said the Republicans face a gerrymandered map this year, "gerrymandered in favor of the Democrats" "But despite that we're going to make history. You will not see the Republican party lose seats ... in two weeks. And my prediction is you'll see us gain seats," he said. All 120 seats in the state Legislature are on the line Tuesday. Of those, Democrats hold 71 and Republicans hold 49. As Tuesday approaches, Christie -- and his party -- have repeated in public speeches and internal memos the claim about historical midterm losses. PolitiFact New Jersey found it’s true. Since Richard Hughes, a Democrat, took office in 1962, the governor’s party has lost seats in the Legislature in the governor’s first midterm election. McGreevey, also a Democrat, is the only exception. Some New Jersey governors faced worse losses than others. William Cahill lost 26 Republican seats in the 1971 election. Fellow Republican Christine Todd Whitman lost two seats in 1995. In 1991, Republicans gained control of 31 Democratic seats in Jim Florio’s first -- and last -- midterm election. Fellow Democrat Jon Corzine lost one legislative seat to Republicans in 2007 in what would also be his only midterm election. McGreevey picked up six Democratic seats in the state Legislature in 2003. He was the first governor to gain seats since Robert Meyner, a Democrat, did in the 1950s. This trend is not unique to New Jersey. Since Harry Truman became president in 1945, the president has lost seats in Congress in the midterm of his first term, except George W. Bush in 2002. So what gives? The public has a somewhat schizophrenic attitude toward politicians, said John Weingart, associate director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University. On one hand the public thinks "they are all useless, at best," he said. On the other hand the public expects "great things from them. And then there is a disappointment when they’re not able to change the world in two years or four years." Ben Dworkin, director of the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University, said "governors typically come in on a wave and when the governor is no longer at the top of the ticket some of the people who were elected during the gubernatorial election might not be as strong." They "ride in on somebody’s coattails and then you don’t have the coattails anymore," he said. But, Dworkin said, the Republicans have "have been downplaying expectations" and have positioned themselves "to be able to spin a positive message regardless of what the results are" on Tuesday. "If the Republicans just stay even," it’s a victory, he said. But if the Republicans "win one or two or potentially five or six seats" between the Senate and Assembly it’s a "huge, huge victory, even if they don’t take control of the Legislature." Our ruling Christie said for more than 48 years, every governor of New Jersey has lost legislative seats at the midterm of his or her first term, with the exception of McGreevey in 2003. Besides McGreevey, you have to go back to the the 1950s to find a governor who has picked up legislative seats from his or her party in the first midterm election. We rate Christie’s statement True.

pomt-13537	On drilling off the Atlantic coast	full flop	/virginia/statements/2016/aug/29/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-reverses-stance-offshore-drilling/	Republicans say Tim Kaine is melding his views to match those of the Democratic presidential ticket he joined recently. In an Aug. 15 post, the Republican National Committee accused Kaine of flip-flopping on several issues. Tops on their list is Kaine’s position on offshore drilling. "Kaine recently told activists he supports banning offshore drilling off the Atlantic Coast despite being a strong advocate for offshore drilling for years," the GOP says. We decided to pull out the Flip-O-Meter to see if Kaine’s position has shifted on that issue. The prospect of drilling for oil and natural gas off Virginia’s coast and other Atlantic states has been hotly debated for years. At the start of this decade, energy leases to explore off Virginia’s coast were scheduled to begin. But a moratorium on those activities has been in place since the 2010 explosion on BP’s Deepwater Horizon offshore oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico. In 2013, Kaine’s first year in the U.S. Senate, he co-sponsored a measure with fellow Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner that called for opening the waters off the coast of Virginia to oil and gas drilling. The legislation called for state coffers to get a 50 percent cut of the energy royalties from drilling off Virginia’s coast. It also said that drilling wouldn’t be done in any area where it would threaten military operations or national security. "Virginia is well-positioned to be a national leader in offshore energy exploration. A comprehensive energy strategy – including oil, gas, wind, solar, tidal and other areas – can transition us to a clean energy future while bridging that transition with secure U.S. fuels we don’t have to import," Kaine said in a joint 2013 statement with Warner. "Virginia’s diverse energy portfolio is a model for the nation. This legislation will bolster our energy security, create jobs, and direct revenues to Virginia that will support important priorities across the state." A couple months later, in June 2013, Kaine penned an op-ed in The Washington Post in which he said "I support development of offshore energy (gas, oil, wind and tidal) in the Atlantic." In April 2015, Kaine was among eight senators who signed a letter to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee asking for legislation that would provide Atlantic Coast states a share of revenues from offshore oil and gas exploration if that area was opened to new energy leases. "Bipartisan support for oil and gas development on the Atlantic OCS (Outer Continental Shelf) can be found at the federal, state and local levels," Kaine and the other senators from Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia wrote. "Our states want the opportunity to create new jobs, generate new revenue." The Obama administration had been examining whether to allow oil and natural gas drilling off Virginia and those three other Atlantic Coast states, and it included them in initial plans to open areas off the coast for oil and gas leases from 2017 to 2022. But the U.S. Department of the Interior, on March 15, said it had decided not to open the waters off Virginia and the other Atlantic Coast states for oil and gas exploration. It released an updated five-year offshore energy plan that proposes leasing operations in parts of the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska. The Interior Department said it was particularly moved by opposition from coastal communities as well as objections from the Department of Defense that the drilling could affect military operations along the coast in places including Hampton Roads. The same day of the Interior Department’s announcement, Kaine said he long had called for the federal government to reconsider its moratorium on drilling off the Atlantic Coast. But in that prepared March 15 statement, Kaine signaled his position was softening: "I am particularly struck by the material objections of the Department of Defense to the incompatibility of drilling with naval operations off Virginia’s coast, cited by the BOEM (Bureau of Oceanic Energy Management) as one of the three principal reasons for their decision. I have participated in this debate for over a decade as a governor and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The DOD has been relatively quiet during this public debate and has never shared their objections with me before. I look forward to additional discussions with DOD to understand its position." Fast forward to August 2016. Kaine was asked after an Aug. 13 rally in Manchester, N.H., if he supported a ban on offshore drilling. "Well, I actually am now in that position, because the Obama administration has decided not to do offshore drilling because the Defense Department objects, and I share those objections," Kaine said in a video of his response that was tweeted out by 350 Action, an environmental advocacy group. The Richmond Times-Dispatch noted in an Aug. 15 story that Kaine’s opposition put him in line with Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who expressed support for the Department of the Interior’s position. We asked Amy Dudley, Kaine’s national spokeswoman, for elaboration for the reasons of Kaine’s shifting stance on offshore drilling. "As a member of the Armed Services Committee, Sen. Kaine met with DoD (Department of Defense) officials to further discuss the impact that oil drilling would have on our military operations in Hampton Roads, and concluded we should not be undertaking speculative drilling activities that could potentially impact installations in the region," Dudley wrote in a prepared statement. "Sen. Kaine recognizes the Navy is a key economic pillar of the Hampton Roads economy and must be protected." With the Flip-O-Meter, we don’t take a stance on whether a policy shift is a good or bad thing. We’re examining whether a change of position has occurred. Here, there’s little doubt that Kaine, who pushed for opening waters off the Virginia coast to drilling in 2013, opposes it now. His spokeswoman says he has come to that conclusion on the basis of additional information from Pentagon officials. So we rate this a Full Flop.

pomt-10895	"James Clapper Flips On Live TV, Admits Obama Behind Entire Russia Witch Hunt! (Video)"	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/aug/06/americanjournalreviewcom/article-wrong-clapper-said-obama-behind-trump-russ/	A website accused James Clapper of throwing President Barack Obama under the bus for ordering the Trump campaign "witch hunt." The headline published on AmericanJournalReview.com says, "James Clapper Flips On Live TV, Admits Obama Behind Entire Russia Witch Hunt! (Video)." This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This story is drawn from an interview on CNN in which Clapper pushed back against President Donald Trump’s claim that Obama failed to address Russia’s meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The clip shows Clapper, the former director of national intelligence under Obama, telling Anderson Cooper: "One point I'd like to make, Anderson, that I don't think has come up very much before, and I'm alluding now to the president's criticism of President Obama for all that he did or didn't do before he left office with respect to the Russian meddling. "If it weren’t for President Obama, we might not have done the intelligence community assessment that we did, that set up a whole sequence of events which are still unfolding today, notably, Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation. President Obama is responsible for that. It was he who tasked us to do that intelligence community assessment in the first place." Clapper is talking about an assessment that Obama asked the intelligence community to carry out beginning in early December 2016, around the time the CIA had concluded Russia meddled in the election to help Trump and hurt Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. But Obama’s request for an intelligence deep-dive into Russian meddling doesn't support what the headline claims. The article is referring to a different aspect of the Russia probe, which didn’t emerge until several months after Obama left the White House. The key distinction here is the difference between the intelligence community assessment Obama ordered in December 2016, and the appointment in May 2017 of Robert Mueller as special counsel. Mueller was tasked to investigate both Moscow’s election interference as well as ties between Russia and the Trump campaign. According to Kenneth Gray, a criminal justice professor at the University of New Haven, an intelligence community threat assessment is one method developed in response to Pearl Harbor. Agencies wanted to prevent surprise attacks against the United States and identify potential threats. The article wrongly conflates the Obama-directed intelligence assessment with Mueller’s investigation of possible collusion by members of Trump’s campaign. It’s also important to note that it was a Trump appointee, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller as special counsel. Obama may have been a distant link in a causal chain, but it was a Trump appointee who is directly responsible for the ongoing special counsel probe. A close reading of Clapper’s interview makes clear he never said Obama was the proximate cause of the Mueller investigation, as the article alleges. Clapper has also rejected the notion that the investigation is a "witch hunt." Part of our reporting process is to reach out to the author of claims we’re checking. The author of this story, Adriana, has no last name in her byline or contact information on the website. The article also has no published date. Our ruling The headline on an article from AmericanJournalReview says, "James Clapper Flips On Live TV, Admits Obama Behind Entire Russia Witch Hunt! (Video)." In the video the article references, Clapper said Obama tasked intelligence officials to assess threats after the CIA concluded Russia meddled in the 2016 election. Obama requested the threat assessment in December 2016 and the special counsel wasn’t appointed until May 2017. The article inaccurately conflates these two events. It’s inaccurate to say Clapper "flips" in his statement. He is referring to a different aspect of the Russian investigation than the article suggests. We found no change of position from Clapper.

pomt-06544	On how he measures his promise to create 700,000 private-sector jobs in seven years.	full flop	/florida/statements/2011/oct/04/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-changes-math-700000-jobs-pledge/	Rick Scott, the candidate, ran on a platform of creating jobs. That's why the businessman-turned-politician won a bruising Republican primary last summer, he said. That's why he squeaked by Democrat Alex Sink in November 2010. "That was my whole campaign," he said in February. "Seven steps to 700,000 jobs over seven years." And more than a year since candidate Scott rolled out his 7-7-7 plan, Gov. Scott still talks frequently about those 700,000 jobs. But just how do you keep track? Scott the candidate offered one measure: "Our plan is seven steps to 700,000 jobs," he said in a debate a year ago, "and that plan is on top of what normal growth would be." Now Scott the governor is offering another. "700,000," he told reporters Oct. 4, 2011, when asked how many jobs he promised to create. "But the initial promise was to create 700,000 on top of projected growth," Scott was asked. "No," Scott said. While the creation of those jobs is a central promise we're tracking on the Scott-O-Meter, we wanted to rate Scott's statements about his promise on our Flip-O-Meter, which PolitiFact Florida created to measure whether a candidate's shifting on any particular position. Scott: 'We're going to grow 700,000 more jobs' Let's rewind to July 2010. State economists had already estimated Florida's recession rebound — no matter who the new governor might be — would add more than 1 million jobs by 2017. On July 21, Scott unveiled his 7-7-7 plan. He would introduce "accountability budgeting." He would reduce government spending. He would cut regulation. He would focus on job growth and retention. He would invest in world-class universities. He would shrink property taxes. He would get rid of the state's corporate income tax. Those changes would create 665,000 jobs over seven years. He rounded up, and the 700,000 jobs promise was born. Reporters wanted to know: If the state's expected growth alone was projected to restore 1 million jobs, did that mean Scott's structural changes to spending, regulation and the tax code would add 700,000 more? "Are those jobs that are in addition to the number of jobs that are going to be created automatically, just without any change in tax policy over the next five or 10 years?" a reporter asked Scott while traveling on his campaign bus. (We know, because we have the video.) Scott answered yes, then pointed out that jobs aren't created automatically. The reporter then corrected himself. "Well, projected. The job creation that is projected over the next five years," he said. "It's what's projected, yeah. It's what's projected, yeah," Scott said, nodding. "It's on top of that. If you do these things we're going to grow 700,000 more jobs." Reporters had their answer. Scott's plan would "grow 700,000 more jobs" than Florida would generate without him. Three months later, Scott made pretty much the same statement during a debate sponsored by Leadership Florida and the Florida Press Association. (We have video of that, too.) "Our plan is seven steps to 700,000 jobs, and that plan is on top of what normal growth would be," Scott said. The debate moderator later noted that would mean creating about 1.7 million jobs, when only about 1 million Floridians were currently unemployed. "We're going to grow the state," Scott responded. In November, Florida elected the jobs governor. Scott: 'I don't know who said that' Not long after that, Scott moved the goalpost. The new promise: Create 700,000 jobs. Period. In June, Scott spokesman Brian Burgess touted news that Florida had added 50,000 jobs since January, saying that Scott was going to count every one toward keeping his promise. In the same few days, another Scott spokesman, Lane Wright, brushed off a question about Scott's original promise to create 700,000 jobs "on top of what normal growth would be." "Gov. Scott committed to creating 700,000 jobs in seven years, and we are on track to meet that goal," Wright said. In August, the governor himself weighed in. An Associated Press reporter reminded Scott that his jobs plan was designed to generate 700,000 jobs on top of those restored by the state's expected growth. "No, that's not true," Scott said. So, the reporter pushed, statements by his campaign were totally wrong? "I don't know who said that," Scott said. "I have no idea." Last week, the governor again faced the question he was asked as a candidate, nearly a year prior. This time, instead of a debate audience, Scott faced members of the Sun Sentinel editorial board. "Your pledge was for 700,000 in addition to normal growth, wasn't it?'' Scott was asked. No, he replied. The problem with Scott's new position is that there are at least two times during the campaign -- captured on video -- where Scott said the exact opposite. And in both those cases, someone asked Scott a follow up question. And in both replies, Scott reinforced his position -- 700,000 jobs, on top of normal growth. Now, Scott says it's just 700,000. To be clear: That's a difference of about 1 million jobs. The governor's plan was on the record, and it was specific. His policy changes, from regulatory reform to spending cuts, would result in job growth. Instead, his office has counted every net new private sector job — starting from before the governor had a chance to change policy. For the governor, that means a tally of more than 71,000 jobs since January. On the Flip-O-Meter, that counts as a Full Flop. See the WTSP version of this fact check here.

pomt-13115	Says Ron Johnson "is benefiting from several super PACs, I am not."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/nov/03/russ-feingold/russ-feingold-falsely-claims-only-his-opponent-ben/	Democrat Russ Feingold, locked in a tight rematch with Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, called a recent attack ad from Johnson’s camp "simply false" and "intentionally misleading." The ad accused Feingold of starting his Progressives United committee to pay himself and his staff, not to support progressive candidates. (We rated Half True a similar claim from the state GOP) When speaking to reporters in Milwaukee October 27, Feingold said about the ad: "They don’t want to talk about the fact that Senator Johnson not only loves the current finance system, but he is the one who is benefiting from several super PACs. And I am not." We took a look at claim about who benefitted from the Progressive’s United fund. In this item, we are looking at Feingold’s response: That Johnson is benefiting from several super PACs, but he is not. We wondered if that was right. Unpacking the PACs The day after Feingold’s statement, a major Democratic super PAC announced a $2 million ad buy on his behalf. But we’re considering Feingold’s claim at the time he made it. Feingold himself has a history with campaign finance reform — he was half of the McCain-Feingold Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, which limited the amount of money national parties can raise and spend on behalf of their candidates. The act was an attempt to reign in spending, but some say it pushed donors to super PACs that can raise unlimited amounts of money but can’t donate the money directly to a candidate. Which brings us to 2016. At the time of Feingold’s statement, both candidates had already benefited from super PACs, according to data from the Federal Election Committee’s website. Two super PACs — For Our Future and Working America Coalition — had spent around $50,000 to support Feingold. And four super PACs had spent around $950,000 to support Johnson: Citizen PAC, Club for Growth Action, Freedom Partners Action Fund, and Let America Work. Of course, money spent to oppose a candidate also benefits the other and there was even more spent there. Four super PACs spent almost $640,000 to oppose Johnson: For Our Future, Working America Coalition, Planned Parenthood Votes and the League of Conservation Voters Victory Fund. And five super PACs spent more than $2.5 million to oppose Feingold: Americas PAC, Citizen PAC, Club for Growth Action, The New Prosperity Foundation and Reform Wisconsin Fund. So at the time of Feingold’s statement, super PACs had reported spending around $690,000 on Feingold’s behalf and nearly $3.5 million on Johnson’s. (As noted, an additional $2 million was directed to Feingold the next day.) Feingold’s camp pointed to the fact that Johnson had benefited from a much larger share of super PAC spending. Maybe so. But that’s not what Feingold said. Our rating Feingold said Johnson is "benefiting from several super PACs. And I am not." Simply put, he was. Though such spending for Johnson has been higher, Feingold has received significant super PAC support. Our rating is False.	None	Russ Feingold	None	None	None	2016-11-03T15:18:08	2016-10-27	['None']
pomt-14411	Says Barack Obama "has the legal authority to let in really however many refugees he wants, from whatever country."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/mar/11/ron-johnson/how-much-authority-does-barack-obama-have-allowing/	U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, who is bracing for an election rematch with Democratic challenger Russ Feingold, was asked at a public forum how concerned he is about the government’s plans to accept 10,000 refugees from Syria -- a move that stoked fears about terrorism in the U.S. In his response, the Wisconsin Republican made a claim that suggests President Barack Obama has unilateral powers when it comes to resettlement. "President Obama has the legal authority to let in really however many refugees he wants, from whatever country," Johnson said Feb. 5, 2016 at Marquette University Law School in Milwaukee. "That’s his legal authority." The statement by Johnson, who is chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, overstates the president’s authority. By law, the president sets the framework for accepting refugees -- setting an annual ceiling on the number and setting priorities on which countries are included. But the ceiling figure can’t come out of thin air -- it must be chosen in consultation with Congress. Moreover, the president and Congress set budgets for the agencies involved in resettlement. Trouble in Syria A refugee is defined as a person fleeing his or her country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion In Syria, unrest began in 2011 with protests against President Bashar al-Assad, in the wake of the pro-democracy Arab Spring. Assad’s regime responded with violence, and the country spiraled into a civil war. Civilians have been fleeing unrest in Syria — where more than 200,000 people have been killed in the conflict. Almost 130,000 Syrian migrants have reached Europe by sea just during the first two months of 2016, according to the International Organization for Migration. The crisis in Europe led Obama in September 2015 to tell his administration to take in at least 10,000 displaced Syrians over the next year. That was up from fewer than 2,000 over the previous 12 months. The law The federal Immigration and Nationality Act, specifically Section 207, spells out the process for setting parameters on the number of refugees to be admitted. Prior to the start of each federal fiscal year (which begins Oct. 1), the president must determine the number of refugees --"as justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest." The president must arrive at the number, as well as the allocation of refugee slots, after consultation with the House and Senate judiciary committees. As Johnson indicated, speaking strictly about legal authority, the president sets the framework and Congress has no specific power to change the framework. The president does take the lead, but in consultation with Congress, on setting what becomes a ceiling on the number of refugees expected to be accepted each year and the priorities in terms of which countries the refugees come from. As a practical matter, the president wouldn’t be able to pick a number out of thin air. Moreover, Congress holds the power of the purse in funding the agencies involved in resettlement. The figures for the annual ceiling, and for the number of total refugees actually admitted, have been relatively stable during Obama’s time in office, according to a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. The ceiling was 80,000 in fiscal 2009, 2010 and 2011. It dropped to 76,000 in fiscal 2012, then to 70,000 the next three years, before rising to 85,000 in fiscal 2016. Actual admissions didn’t reach the ceiling until fiscal 2013. The process Refugees are processed and admitted to the United States from abroad. The State Department handles overseas processing of refugees and the Department of Homeland Security makes final determinations about eligibility for admission. Which brings up an important point: Those agencies rely on both the president and Congress to for funding. That joint authority was underscored in January 2016 when Obama designated up to $70 million from a special fund set up by Congress to handle the 2016 increase in refugee settlement. It’s also important to remember that, regardless of the refugee numbers set by the president, refugees actually admitted into the U.S. must pass a variety of reviews -- a process that typically takes 18 to 24 months. Security, of course, is a major concern. Terrorism-related grounds for refusing applicants "have been amended to lower the threshold for how substantial, apparent, and immediate an alien’s support for a terrorist activity or organization may be," according to the Congressional Research Service report. An alien, according to the report, "is generally inadmissible for engaging in terrorist activity if he or she gives any material support, such as a safe house, transportation, communications, or funds, to a terrorist organization or any of its members or to a person engaged in terrorist activity." At the same time, there are so many refugees seeking asylum in the U.S. that even if many applicants are rejected, there are more than enough others to take their place before the ceiling is reached. Our rating Johnson said Obama "has the legal authority to let in really however many refugees he wants, from whatever country." Federal law requires the president each year to set a ceiling on the number of refugees to be admitted to the United States in the next 12 months and to set priorities on which countries they come from. But the president does not have unilateral authority. The president must set the framework in consultation with Congress. And both the president and Congress determine funding for the federal agencies involved in the resettlement process. For a statement is that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, our rating is Half True.	None	Ron Johnson	None	None	None	2016-03-11T11:00:00	2016-02-05	['None']
pomt-12522	"No administration has accomplished more in the first 90 days."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/24/donald-trump/how-do-donald-trumps-first-100-days-rate-historica/	As he neared the end of his first 100 days in office, President Donald Trump touted his first three months as a rousing success. "No administration has accomplished more in the first 90 days," Trump told an audience in Kenosha, Wis. That’s a pretty high bar, especially for an administration that has registered historically low levels of support in public-approval polls for presidents this early in their terms. The White House didn’t respond to an inquiry for this article, but when asked about some of the president’s 100-day accomplishments during the April 19 press briefing, White House press secretary Sean Spicer cited a series of executive orders, including some on regulatory reform; a drop in border crossings; and job creation. He said more details would be offered as the 100-day mark approached. We interviewed historians and considered the 100-day track records of presidents back to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. While there’s a lot of nuance in gauging accomplishments, Trump doesn’t have much evidence to back up his boast that his administration has accomplished the most. First, some caveats All presidencies are different, and there’s an especially big difference between those that began after an election and those that got their start suddenly. The latter category includes presidents who took over after the death of their predecessor (such as Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson) or their predecessor’s resignation (Gerald Ford). In addition, it’s easier for a president to put points on the board quickly if they enter office in the midst of a national crisis. This was true for Roosevelt (the Great Depression), Truman (the end of World War II), Ford (the Watergate scandal), and Barack Obama (the Great Recession). Without a crisis, Congress is less likely to act quickly. Perhaps most notably, there is widespread agreement among historians that the 100-day standard is arbitrary. Just because a president signs a significant law outside the 100-day window doesn’t make it less of an accomplishment. For instance, Johnson and Ronald Reagan "laid the groundwork for gigantic accomplishments" such as on civil rights and taxes, respectively, that fell outside the 100-day window, said Princeton University historian Sean Wilentz. And both Truman and Dwight Eisenhower were preoccupied with wars during their first 100 days, said Max J. Skidmore, a University of Missouri-Kansas City political scientist who has written several books on the presidency. This meant they "did not have much in the way of legislative achievements during that period," Skidmore said. All in all, "most presidents have not considered 100 days a significant milepost," said H.W. Brands, a presidential historian at the University of Texas-Austin whose books include Traitor to His Class: The Privileged Life and Radical Presidency of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. "It's largely a media thing." The numbers Let’s start with the raw numbers, Our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker did some calculations comparing Trump’s bill-signing output to that of his predecessors during their first 100 days. The Post counted 28 bills signed by Trump -- the highest since 1949, but well below the 76 signed by Roosevelt in 1933. Moreover, many of Trump’s bills were "minor or housekeeping bills," and none met a longstanding political-science standard for "major bills." By contrast, at least nine of Roosevelt’s did. Meanwhile, by the time of the Kenosha speech, Trump had signed 24 executive orders, 22 presidential memorandums, and 20 proclamations, the Post noted. Some of these started the ball rolling to overturn federal regulations. While these may eventually have a significant impact, it’s worth noting that many new presidents routinely issue orders during their first 100 days that overturn actions of their predecessors of the opposite party. For instance, just two days after taking office, President Bill Clinton signed orders overturning restrictions on abortion imposed during the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations, and with equal speed, President George W. Bush overturned Clinton’s opposition to a ban on aid to international groups that participate in abortions. "Everyone does that, so it doesn’t give him a comparative edge," said David Greenberg, a Rutgers University historian who has written books about Presidents Richard Nixon and Calvin Coolidge. Trump’s accomplishments Historians we checked with mostly agreed that Trump’s appointment of Neil Gorsuch to fill a Supreme Court vacancy was a significant event, and one that could influence public policy long after Trump leaves the White House. That said, some cautioned against making too much of Gorsuch’s confirmation, arguing that it followed the nearly year-long blockage of Obama nominee Merrick Garland by the Republican Senate. "It was really (Senate Majority Leader Mitch) McConnell's achievement," said Jeff Shesol, author of books on Roosevelt and Johnson and a former speechwriter for Clinton. Meanwhile, Trump’s military actions -- his missile strikes on Syria and the dropping of an unusually large bomb on an ISIS bunker -- are hardly unprecedented for a president’s first 100 days. George W. Bush attacked Iraqi radar sites to enforce a no-fly zone, and Obama pledged to double the number of U.S. military personnel in Afghanistan. Trump’s decision to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement echoes George W. Bush’s decision to pull out of the Kyoto Protocol on curbing global warming. And the Trump administration’s successful effort to win the release of Aya Hijazi, an American aid worker jailed for three years in Egypt on dubious charges, isn’t unprecedented either. Moments after taking office in 1981, Ronald Reagan announced the imminent freeing of American hostages held in Iran for over a year. Several historians said Trump has faced some significant setbacks as well. His first big legislative push -- to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act -- stalled without even a final vote, and he has been slower than his predecessors in making sub-cabinet appointments. Trump also failed to submit a detailed budget proposal of the kind his predecessors had typically submitted by now. Then there’s Trump’s immigration ban, which would likely count as a major accomplishment if it’s enacted, but which is frozen for now. It was issued, blocked by the courts, rewritten, and then blocked again. "The fact that he has gotten so little done while having Republican majorities in both houses of Congress is a terrible indictment," Shesol said. The champion: FDR The 100-day record of just one president -- Franklin Roosevelt -- would be enough to cast doubt on the accuracy of Trump’s claim that no administration has accomplished more. The 15 major bills Roosevelt signed included those that created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Tennessee Valley Authority (both of which still exist) and the Home Owners Loan Corp. He signed the Agricultural Adjustment Act, which established farm subsidies, and the National Industrial Recovery Act, which started public-works efforts to reverse the Great Depression. He signed legislation to legalize the manufacture and sale of beer and wine, and he issued executive orders to establish the Civilian Conservation Corps and to effectively take the United States off the gold standard. All in all, Roosevelt pushed the federal government to take a much bigger role than it had previously, said Adam Cohen, author of Nothing to Fear: FDR's Inner Circle and the Hundred Days That Created Modern America. "When FDR took office, the banking system had collapsed," Cohen said. "His emergency banking act got the banks open again and the system up and running. He got the Securities Act of 1933 enacted. It was the first major federal regulation of the stock market, which laid the groundwork for the kind of government regulation we now take for granted." Other presidents’ 100-day achievements Other presidents have chalked up significant achievements as well. Clinton signed the Family and Medical Leave Act, while Obama signed not only a nearly $800 billion stimulus package to combat a spiraling recession but also the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and a law expanding the Children’s Health Insurance Program. He also implemented two urgent economic programs formally passed in the final weeks of George W. Bush’s presidency -- the Troubled Asset Relief Program and the auto industry bailout. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Other presidents have taken executive actions at least as significant as Trump’s. Kennedy established the Peace Corps (later ratified by Congress). Ford, meanwhile, pardoned his predecessor, Nixon, and offered amnesty to Vietnam War draft dodgers. Truman’s first 100 days were a whirlwind of foreign-policy actions -- the end of World War II in Europe, the writing of the United Nations charter, the dropping of two atomic bombs on Japan, and Japan’s unconditional surrender. Sometimes, a president’s biggest accomplishment is intangible. Roosevelt calmed a nation gut-punched by the Depression, while Johnson reassured Americans after the shock of Kennedy’s assassination. "The main accomplishment of LBJ's first 100 days -- and this should not be discounted just because it did not involve a bunch of bill signings -- was to give the nation and its government a sense of stability and continuity after one of the most wrenching events of the century," said his biographer, Shesol. Evaluating Trump’s 100 days One of the biggest impacts of Trump’s first 100 days may fall into this "intangible" category. "Even if there are not many major tangible accomplishments, his administration has changed the political and cultural trajectory of the country -- not as much as FDR did following Herbert Hoover, but more than the average new president does," Cohen said. "It has been somewhat amorphous and hard to quantify, but it is certainly something many Americans are feeling." John Frendreis, a political scientist at Loyola University in Chicago, said Trump’s 100 days seem most similar to Clinton’s, which were also disorganized, short of focus and marked by the failure to pass an economic stimulus package. That said, he added, "it is instructive to note that Clinton’s presidency turned out to be reasonably successful after this rocky start, so this suggests a similar turn-around is possible for Trump." Whatever happens down the road, Trump, like his predecessors, is getting a dose of reality, Brands said. "The big story of Trump's 100 days is how much reality has intruded on his notions of what a president can accomplish," he said. "Every newcomer to the White House is sobered by the experience. Trump had more sobering to do to most." Our ruling Trump said, "No administration has accomplished more in the first 90 days." Trump has had some achievements in office, but at the very least, they are much less numerous and far-reaching than those of Roosevelt, the standard against whom all presidents are measured. In more recent years, other presidents, including Obama, have accomplished more in their first 100 days than Trump has, historians say. We rate the claim False.

pomt-06349	"You’re paying for...(state Sen. Diane Allen’s) health care, and she took yours away."	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/nov/07/carl-lewis/olympic-medalist-carl-lewis-calls-out-state-senato/	A prolonged legal battle kicked him off the ballot in Tuesday’s election, but former Democratic State Senate candidate Carl Lewis has taken aim at a Republican incumbent who "took" away health care from the public. At a recent appearance in Willingboro, Burlington County, the nine-time Olympic gold medalist accused state Sen. Diane Allen (R-Burlington) of receiving taxpayer-funded health care, but stripping away coverage from her constituents. Allen is seeking reelection Tuesday against Democratic challenger Gail Cook. "Your senator right now is dancing across the stage, just had...a cancer scare and you know what, guess what? Every single person in this room is paying for her health care. Did you know that? But she took yours," Lewis told the crowd. Soon afterwards, Lewis added: "So you’re paying for…her health care, and she took yours away." PolitiFact New Jersey found that Lewis is exaggerating Allen’s impact on health care in Burlington County. Allen does receive state health benefits and, in July, she abstained from restoring $7.5 million in state funding for family planning services. But that cut only impacted a limited number of Burlington County residents and, across the state, many affected New Jerseyans have been able to receive services from other health centers. Lewis spokesman Chris Walker confirmed the claim was in reference to the $7.5 million, and said Lewis would speak to us. But we never heard back. First, let’s explain Allen’s health care coverage. Allen is receiving health coverage for herself and her husband through the State Health Benefits Program, according to Bill Quinn, a state Treasury Department spokesman. Still, like other state employees, Allen must pay a percentage of her premium costs. Now, let’s talk about whether Allen "took" away health care from Burlington County residents. Nearly a year after Gov. Chris Christie eliminated $7.5 million for family planning services, the Democrat-controlled Legislature tried this past summer to restore the funding. Christie vetoed that spending, and the Democrats failed in July to get enough votes to override his veto. Allen abstained from that vote -- counting her as a no -- but even if she voted yes, the Senate still would have been one vote shy of restoring the funding. The funding cut made last year led to the closure of six of the state’s family planning centers, including two clinics in Burlington County. But according to county spokesman Ralph Shrom, those two locations served a combined total of about 1,500 patients in 2010. That’s less than 5 percent of the population of Willingboro, where Lewis made his remarks. The patients formerly served at those clinics are referred to two federally qualified health centers in the county, Shrom said in an email. Shrom said: "Those close to this situation would say it did leave people without care, and there are probably individuals who did not follow up on the referral or may have found the alternatives inconvenient." Shrom added, "On the other side of the equation, those who did follow the referral advice now have a ‘medical home’ -- that is, they are now going to a clinic that can attend to all the health care needs of themselves and their families and seeing a doctor who can keep continuing records." Katherine Grant-Davis, president and CEO of the New Jersey Primary Care Association, which represents the federally qualified centers, said that in many cases across the state, former family planning patients have turned to the federally qualified centers. "We are the safety net," Grant-Davis told us. Allen said she would have liked the $7.5 million to remain in the state budget, but she abstained from the override vote because the state couldn’t afford it. The senator noted how she has been honored by different health organizations. "I’ve worked very hard on making sure health care’s available for everybody," Allen said. Our ruling At a recent rally in Willingboro, Lewis accused Allen of receiving taxpayer-funded health care, while taking health care away from the public. Allen receives state health benefits, and she must contribute toward her premium costs. But Lewis’ larger claim about her taking away health care is off base. The governor eliminated the funding for family planning services and a yes-vote from Allen wouldn’t have changed that. Also, the funding cut has affected a fraction of her constituents and similar services are being offered at other health centers. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-02382	Seneca Jones Timber Co., aiming to increase logging and allay fears that old growth will be cut, says mills have shifted to second-generation trees. An ad from the company asks: "Do you know that most all mills in Oregon have retooled over the past 20 years?"	true	/oregon/statements/2014/mar/14/seneca-jones/have-most-all-oregon-sawmills-retooled-over-past-2/	A good way to get an argument roaring louder than a chain saw is to bring up Northwest forest policy. Topics ranging from clear-cutting to what constitutes "old growth" are bound to spark tussles. Forestry issues are again in the news as U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and other members of the state’s congressional delegation pitch plans to increase harvest levels from the so-called O&C lands -- 2.4 million acres of federally owned forestlands sprawled across 18 western Oregon counties. Many are watching closely, knowing decisions coming out of Washington, D.C., could have controversial implications for Oregon. Among those following the debate are Aaron Jones’ three daughters. Jones opened his Seneca Jones sawmill in Eugene more than 60 years ago. Becky, Kathy and Jody Jones are taking out newspaper ads touting the benefits of "forestry stewardship," among other things. An ad that ran in Oregon newspapers, including The Oregonian, on March 2, 2014, presses for more timber harvests and seeks to allay fears that old growth will be cut. It says mills are now focused on second-generation trees, and claims: "Do you know that most all mills in Oregon have retooled over the past 20 years?" We revved up our saw and checked. We called Kathy Jones. She said the ads are aimed at influencing the debate over O&C lands, which could yield increased timber for Oregon sawmills. "Some people keep saying we are ruining the forests, that we are cutting old growth at every opportunity," Jones said. "It’s just not true. What is true is that almost every mill still operating in Oregon has retooled to accept second-growth logs. "And I’m fine with that. I love those big cathedral forests. They should stay just as they are." Jones said her definition of old growth begins when a tree’s diameter reaches 48 inches. The logs Seneca accepts average about 30 inches, she said. As for Seneca’s own retooling efforts, Jones said lasers now scan all incoming logs. Computers tell operators what sizes of studs and other lumber are most in demand at the moment, and the cutting begins. "We have almost as many computer operators as we do people out on the floor," Jones said. "That’s how this industry operates these days." We called Paul Barnum, executive director of the Oregon Forest Resources Institute. The Legislature created the group in 1991 to bring forest scientists, public agencies, forest landowners and community and conservation groups together. Barnum referred us to a 2012 report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Pacific Northwest Research Station. A chapter assessing Oregon’s sawmill sector said, in part, "Technological improvements have made Oregon mills more efficient in numerous ways. Log size (diameter and length) sensing capabilities linked to computer determine the best sawing pattern for logs to recover either the greatest volume or greatest value from each other." We asked Barnum about the Seneca Jones claim. "There may be three or four mills that still process old-growth timber, which comes pretty much from private forestlands," he said. "The mills still operating have retooled to concentrate on getting more value from second- and third-generation timber." Barnum also passed along a report from Paul F. Ehinger & Associates, which said that in 2010 -- the last time the numbers were updated -- Oregon had 106 operating sawmills. For another view, we called Steve Pedery, conservation director at Oregon Wild. The group has long fought clear-cutting and old-growth harvesting, but has won U.S. Forest Service awards in recent years for helping design timber-restoration sales. Pedery passed along an Oregon Wild report detailing nine westside mills that still accept large logs. "What this highlights," he said, "is that there is still an appetite for old growth out there. If they could get it, they would." Regarding the retooling claim, he said: "Saying ‘most’ misses the point of the policy debate. There are still mills looking for large-diameter trees and they are all in southwest Oregon, where the remaining big trees are." One of the mills in the report, D.R. Johnson Lumber in Riddle, is currently mothballed, according to both the report and an employee who answered our call there. Another listed as accepting large-diameter logs is Rough & Ready Lumber Co. in Cave Junction. Coincidentally, that operation announced this month that it will soon reopen a retooled small-log mill that’s been closed since last year. "Unless you are a real niche operation looking for the occasional large log that comes along, you’ve retooled," said co-owner Jennifer Phillippi, whose grandfather founded Rough and Ready 92 years ago. "You wouldn’t still be in business otherwise." The ruling The owners of Seneca Jones sawmill in Eugene want harvest levels from federally managed O&C lands increased but with primarily second- and third-generation trees. They say the timber industry agrees, adding, "Most all mills in Oregon have retooled over the past 20 years" to accept smaller trees. A key environmental group maintains that old-growth cutting would commence if rules pertaining to federal lands are changed. The ongoing debate over timber policy in Washington, D.C., will determine whether they are. But we can look at the numbers, which show that of the 106 or so mills in Oregon, only a handful have not retooled and still look to buy large-diameter logs. The overwhelming majority, according to a forestry group created by the Legislature, use machinery that’s been added in recent years to accept smaller logs. It bears out the assertion that "most all" sawmills have retooled. We rate the claim True. Return to OregonLive.com/politics to comment on this ruling.

pomt-06285	"Community banks … are being destroyed by Dodd-Frank."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/21/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-dodd-frank-destroying-community/	No politician will ever lose votes by coming down on the side of community banks. Unlike the mega-banks of Wall Street that helped fuel the world’s dive off an economic cliff, community banks have a better reputation. They avoid exotic financial deals and, for the most part, stick to their knitting. GOP hopeful Newt Gingrich offered himself as their defender when he spoke to supporters at campaign headquarters in Manchester, N.H. "Community banks are 12 percent of the banks right now and 40 percent of the loans to small business," Gingrich said. "And they are being destroyed by Dodd-Frank." Dodd-Frank is the financial overhaul bill passed by Congress in 2010. Gingrich says it should be repealed, in part because of its impact on these local banks. We asked the Gingrich campaign to give us the data that informed the former House speaker’s belief. Staffer R.C. Hammond replied "It was his observation. How do you source an opinion?" But Gingrich didn't say, "I think community banks are being destroyed by Dodd-Frank. He asserted it as a fact. The first thing to note is that one year after the passage of Dodd-Frank, community banks are healthier. By convention, any bank with assets of less than $1 billion is a community bank. According to the latest report from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, for that group of banks, a key measure of profitability, return on assets, has doubled in the past year, growing from 0.26 percent a year ago to 0.57 percent in the second quarter of 2011. Return on assets has been higher this year than in any quarter going back to the start of 2008 before the great meltdown. While it wouldn’t be fair to give Dodd-Frank full credit for that improvement (the improving economy is probably a factor), neither is it accurate to credit the law with the demise of the industry when the reports of that demise are premature. Not only are they not dead, "community banks on the whole are healthier than they were last year," said Chris Cole, senior vice president of the Independent Community Bankers of America. The trade group that represents some 5,000 of these smaller banks views Dodd-Frank as a mixed bag. Cole said it has done some good things. High on the plus side, it will save his members about $4.5 billion over three years in the fees they pay to the FDIC. "The assessment rates was a big benefit," said Cole. Community banks have "experienced 30 to 40 percent decreases in their assessments. For many community banks, Dodd-Frank has not been all that bad," he said. In a letter marking the one-year anniversary of Dodd-Frank, ICBA’s President Camden Fine also praised the law for making inroads in supervising the mega-banks and putting non-bank financial firms, which can range from insurance companies to hedge funds, under more of a regulatory microscope. ICBA is not head-over-heels in love with the financial reforms. It doesn’t like the limits the new law puts on the fees banks can charge each time a customer uses a debit card. Initially, the rate was capped at 12 cents per swipe. Regulators later changed that to 21 cents. If there is one overarching fear that smaller banks have with Dodd-Frank, it is the prospect of new regulations. "We are expecting compliance costs to increase dramatically," Rose Oswald Poels, president of the Wisconsin Bankers Association, told the Milwaukee BizTimes The president of the American Bankers Association, Frank Keating, warned in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece of a "mountainous regulatory burden" that will overwhelm small banks. "Federal regulators have issued 4,870 Federal Register pages of proposed or final rules affecting banks, " Keating wrote. "Many more are still to come—for a grand total of more than 240 rules." What Keating fails to mention is that many of the rules under Dodd-Frank specifically exempt community banks. "A lot of the stuff in Dodd-Frank is really meant to be targeted at the big guys, not the small ones," said Arthur Wilmarth, a law professor at George Washington University Law School who testifies regularly on Capitol Hill on banking issues. Wilmarth said many more rules could exempt smaller banks depending on how they are written. The ultimate decision on debit card fees is a good example. Not only did regulators raise the allowable fee, the law exempted all banks with assets under $10 billion from the new rule. The ICBA's Cole makes a larger point -- that one should hold judgment on the new law. "The implementation of Dodd-Frank is just halfway through," he said. "It’s too early to say what it is." Cole said so far, regulators have been very responsive. "They’ve been willing to listen and reach out to us." A major goal of lobbyists for community banks was to pass a law that treated small banks differently from large ones, and the ICBA says they achieved that in Dodd-Frank. One sign of this divide: when the ICBA -- representing small banks -- and the ABA -- representing banks both large and small -- listed their lobbying priorities for 2011, there was virtually no overlap. The ABA for example wants to change the oversight of derivatives, but small banks rarely touch derivatives trading. And the two organizations totally part ways on deposit insurance. The ABA wants to trim back the Dodd-Frank changes, while the ICBA members want to keep the savings they gained from the law. Wilmarth and others criticized Dodd-Frank for not going far enough to deal with banks that are to big to fail, but, in most ways, it is tougher on the big banks than it is on the small ones, they said. Our Ruling: Gingrich said that community banks "are being destroyed by Dodd-Frank." But as a whole they are healthier than a year ago. No doubt the improvement in the economy has helped, but community banks also have benefited from a reduction in fees paid to the FDIC as a result of Dodd-Frank. From the point of view of community banks, Dodd-Frank is imperfect and still unfolding. But it has exempted community banks from many new regulations. That said, the shape of the rules to come will make a big difference in its final impact on them. To say that this industry is being destroyed by Dodd-Frank is untrue and unlikely to be true in the future if regulators continue to respond to the concerns of small banks. We rate Gingrich's statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1ce81073-8a07-4eda-83a2-70e02ed776fe	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2011-11-21T12:53:58	2011-11-11	['None']
pomt-00131	"President Donald Trump signed DEPLOYMENT ORDERS for the 82nd Airborne Division of the United States Army, instructing them to deploy from Ft. Bragg, NC, to the U.S. southern border at Mexico."	false	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/oct/26/blog-posting/no-trump-didnt-sign-orders-82nd-airborne-division/	Sometimes a hoax can morph into something of reality. As a large caravan of migrants marches for the United States, we have seen our share of unfounded claims about the events. In one Facebook post on Oct. 22, a user announced that "minutes ago, prior to taking the stage in Houston, TX: President Donald Trump signed DEPLOYMENT ORDERS for the 82nd Airborne Division of the United States Army, instructing them to deploy from Ft. Bragg, NC, to the U.S. southern border at Mexico." This particular story is a hoax. But it turns out, Trump has decided to send some troops to the border. More on that in a second. The poster went on to say that 1st Armored Division of the Army stationed in Ft. Campbell, Kentucky, was given 72-hour ready-standby orders to start shipping armored vehicles to the border and that "covert intelligence" had confirmed the caravan had grown to more than 10,000. An additional 40,000 Mexicans were staging to join them in northern Mexico. "The OPEN PLAN THEY ARE IMPLEMENTING is for more than 50,000 of these so-called ‘migrants’ to physically storm the U.S. border to gain entry into our country," according to the post. "Our President Trump is not going to allow that. Article 4, Section 4 of the US Constitution REQUIRES the federal government to protect each of the states from invasion. The ‘migrant caravan’ is now classified as ‘an invasion force’ against which the US government will take action." This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Here’s what really did happen: Trump was in Houston; he spoke at a "Make America Great Again" rally in support of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who is up for re-election. And a few days before the rally, the president threatened to deploy the military to shut down the border to stop the migrants march north. "I must, in the strongest terms, ask Mexico to stop this onslaught," Trump tweeted, "and if unable to do so I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!" On Oct. 22, Trump told a USA Today reporter that he would send as many troops as necessary to block the caravan. He called their trek "an assault on our country," according to the newspaper. But there’s no evidence that Trump deployed the 82nd Airborne or that troops in Kentucky were put on notice. While we were writing this fact-check, credible reports did surface that the president is preparing to send to the border at least 800 U.S. Army troops, including engineers to help construct tents and fencing, doctors for medical support and "potentially some personnel to operate drones along the border," the New York Times reported. Still, none of what was said about deploying specific troops to respond to an "invasion," as the Facebook post described, has been reported by legitimate media. Next, the migrant caravan was growing. It’s the largest caravan of it’s kind in recent years, according to The Washington Post, which put the number of migrants at "more than 5,000." On Oct. 22, the United Nations estimated that about 7,200 people are currently walking north. One of the caravan’s organizers told CNN that 7,500 people are now participating, according to the news organization. Wired called a number listed for an anti-immigration militia on a similar post. "The militia member who answered said that the 42,000 number was bogus, and that government officials have told the group that the caravan consists of around 7,000 people," the magazine said. One newspaper, El Universal in Mexico, reported on Oct. 22 that more than 14,000 Hondurans were at the Mexico-Guatemala border. The paper attributed the figure to municipal authorities, a regional diocese and the National Migration Institute. There doesn’t appear to be evidence that the group will merge with 40,000 Mexicans, though. Our ruling Elements of this Facebook post contain granules of factual information: The caravan is large and has been growing, though size estimates vary and there are now reports that weary walkers are turning back. Trump has also threatened to deploy troops to the border. Reports indicate he may send about 800 troops there to offer support. But Trump has not signed deployment orders for the 82nd Airborne Division, as this post specifically claims. We rate this statement False.

pomt-01445	"We have a retiree that is collecting a $17,000 paycheck a month . . . tax free."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/oct/05/jorge-elorza/jorge-elorza-says-providence-paying-17000-month-ta/	If you're looking for reasons why Providence is in financial trouble, Democratic mayoral candidate Jorge Elorza says a good place to start is the city's pension costs. During a Sept. 30, 2014, mayoral debate, he was asked about the city's huge pension debt. Elorza blamed one of his opponents, Vincent A. "Buddy" Cianci Jr., an independent, for signing a consent decree when he was mayor that provided for 5- and 6-percent cost of living allowances for retirees. "Now we have a retiree that is collecting a $17,000 paycheck a month . . . tax free," Elorza said. "How many families in Providence don't make $17,000 a year." "You can thank the court for that," Cianci retorted. We were curious about whether that $17,000 monthly paycheck -- equivalent to $204,000 in annual tax-free income -- is real. Providence officials sent us the 2014 list of the 49 people receiving the largest pension payments. Thirty seven retirees are receiving checks totaling over $100,000 per year, or at least $8,333 each month. All but eight were firefighters. The rest were police officers. At least 28 of those 37 are tax-free disability pensions. Four others may be disability pensions but it's not clear from the list because the money is going to a surviving spouse. At the top of the list: Gilbert McLaughlin of Warwick, who retired in October 1991 with an accidental disability pension. He served as chief for 15 months before retiring, citing health problems stemming from a job-related injury to his neck and shoulders. His annual payment from the city as of May 2014: $196,813. That's $16,401 per month, or $599 shy of the $17,000 cited by Elorza. McLaughlin retired as the city's fire chief at the age of 55. At retirement, his base salary was $63,537 per year plus $6,959 in longevity pay for his 36 years, six months and eleven days of service. Total: $70,496. He received 83.7 percent of that as his pension, or $59,001 a year, according to Lawrence J. Mancini, the city's acting director of administration and finance. His payment grew so large because he received an annual 5-percent compounding cost of living adjustment that was increased to 6 percent in 1996, Mancini said. (Cianci's second stint as Providence mayor ran from 1991 through most of 2002.) All of this was part of a long-running legal war over pensions in the city. The stage was set around 1977, near the beginning of Cianci's first stint as mayor, when the General Assembly gave the city's unions a controlling number of seats on the city's Retirement Board. A 1983 City Charter change, when Cianci was still in office, gave the board extra power to make pension decisions. In 1989, with Joseph Paolino as mayor, the board granted compounded cost-of-living adjustments of 5 and 6 percent for all present and future public safety retirees and 3 percent for non-uniformed workers. In 1991, in the midst of a court battle over pensions, Cianci was back in office and he signed a consent decree that locked in some of the benefits, a decree that he would come to regret. In 2012, in an agreement Mayor Angel Taveras negotiated with the police and fire unions, the city ended the big compounded cost of living adjustments, so his annual pension remains frozen at $196,813. To put this in context, the salary of the current fire chief, Clarence Cunha, is $164,736 a year, including longevity pay. If McLaughlin's initial pension had risen with inflation, and not at 5 or 6 percent, it would be worth $103,036 today, or just under $8,586 a month. Our ruling Jorge Elorza said, "We have a retiree that is collecting a $17,000 paycheck a month . . . tax free." The city's biggest retirement check goes to a retired fire chief who is getting $16,401. Although Elorza overstated the amount a bit, its close enough to rate his statement True.

pomt-02949	Emergency rooms account for "2 percent of all health care spending."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/28/nick-gillespie/does-emergency-care-account-just-2-percent-all-hea/	In recent years, advocates for universal health coverage have regularly decried a side effect of having no health insurance -- the use of emergency rooms as a substitute for basic health care services. For instance, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said in August 2009, "We have 48 million people with no health care. As a result, they walk into emergency rooms. It's costing every American who is insured $1,100 to pick up the cost of uncompensated care that goes on at the emergency room." We gave Boxer’s claim a Mostly False, largely due to questionable assumptions that undermined the calculations Boxer cited. But other Democrats in favor of a health care overhaul, including Hillary Clinton in 2008 and Barack Obama in 2009, also pointed to the use of emergency rooms by uninsured Americans as an argument for passing a health care overhaul. Given the frequency of this talking point, it came as something of a surprise to hear Nick Gillespie, the editor of Reason.com, a libertarian publication, say recently that emergency room costs actually represent a tiny share of health care spending. During the Oct. 22, 2013, edition of CNN’s Crossfire, Gillespie had an exchange with Van Jones, one of the show’s liberal co-hosts. Jones argued that Obama’s health care law should be able to bring uninsured Americans into the health care system in less costly and more efficient ways, cutting the use of emergency rooms for front-line care. Gillespie countered that "emergency rooms (are) 2 percent of all health care spending. It's not a huge amount. That's a big red herring in this." We wondered whether Gillespie was correct. We easily found the source of the statistic -- a calculation publicized by the American College of Emergency Physicians. Obviously, this is a group with a dog in the fight, but the calculation they made was pretty straightforward and is based on federal data. The group used figures from 2008 collected by the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, a study undertaken by a division of the Department of Health and Human Services. The survey found that the total amount of money spent on emergency care -- including physician and other emergency-room services -- was $47.3 billion. That’s slightly less than 2 percent of the same survey’s $2.4 trillion estimate of total health care expenditures that year. We asked a number of experts in health care economics whether they saw any red flags with that kind ofcalculation. Both Austin Frakt of Boston University and Katherine Baicker of the Harvard School of Public Health said the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey is a credible source of data. Their concerns, to the extent they had any, focused on whether the survey under-reports health care costs. Indeed, there is at least one study that suggests just that. A paper in the Annals of Emergency Medicine used different data and an alternative accounting method to determine emergency room costs. The study -- by Michael Lee and Brian Zink of Brown University’s Warren Alpert Medical School and Jeremiah Schuur of Harvard Medical School -- used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, which tallied approximately 130 million ER visits, a much higher number than the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, which counted 49 million visits. Based in part on this discrepancy, the authors said the actual percentage may range anywhere from 4.9 percent to 10 percent, rather than 2 percent. The American College of Emergency Physicians stands by its calculations but acknowledges that other calculations can be legitimate. The data that produced the 2 percent figure "comes from reputable sources, and the calculation is correct," said spokeswoman Julie Lloyd. "At the same time, we know that the numbers could be calculated in different ways." Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, agreed that the percentage of health care spending devoted to emergency rooms could change depending on what figure is used for the denominator. "All these expenditure figures are at best approximations," Wilensky said. "There is no really good, precise way to calculate it." Several experts added that the total amount of money going to emergency care is ultimately less important than making sure that emergency rooms are used for the right type of care. Services provided in the ER do tend to cost significantly more than services provided in a primary-care setting. "Getting anything other than true emergency care in an emergency department tends to be an expensive, fragmented way to receive care and should be avoided if any other reasonable alternative is available," Wilensky said. That said, recent academic studies have suggested that the economics of emergency rooms and the larger health care system are more nuanced than previously thought. For instance, one study by the Rand Corp. suggested that it may be overburdened primary-care doctors -- not patients -- who are driving traffic toward the ER. According to Arthur Kellermann, one of the authors of the RAND paper, doctors described the ER to researchers as their "overflow valve" where they "send complicated patients" for diagnosis. Even Lee, who co-wrote the paper suggesting that ERs could account for as much as 10 percent of health care spending, has said that heavy use of emergency rooms is not necessarily a problem. "Diverting non-emergency care may simply shift costs onto primary care offices and clinics which may not have the infrastructure to accommodate a large volume of unscheduled care," Lee told Science Daily. Our ruling Gillespie said emergency rooms account for "2 percent of all health care spending." Experts told us that’s not the only way to calculate it, but it’s a credible way, and even if that figure is too low, other calculations put it in the single digits. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Nick Gillespie	None	None	None	2013-10-28T10:58:46	2013-10-22	['None']
pomt-10442	There are prototype cars that get between 100 and 150 miles per gallon and "we could have those cars in your garages in a couple of years."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/may/06/hillary-clinton/supercars-unlikely-in-a-couple-years/	With the price of gasoline soaring, the presidential candidates have all talked about long-term plans to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil. In a speech at the North Carolina Democratic Party 2008 Jefferson-Jackson Dinner in Raleigh, N.C., on May 2, 2008, Sen. Hillary Clinton weighed in with this claim: "And we will also make it clear that it is no longer going to be America over the oil barrel — the $120 oil barrel — that we're going to invest on a fast track like an Apollo project in cars that get greater gas mileage. "There are prototypes on the roads of America today that get between 100 and 150 miles per gallon. If we had a president who actually decided that this would be America's priority, we could have those cars in your garages in a couple of years. "In my energy plan, I would give you a $10,000 tax credit to buy a car that got greater gas mileage, to create a market." Industry experts say Clinton is talking about plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, or PHEVs. These cars are a combination of the hybrid cars on the market today and battery electric cars that need to be plugged in and recharged. Some of the prototypes of these cars may be able to get more than 100 miles per gallon, as Clinton said, but there are significant obstacles to getting these from the prototype stage to mass market production in just a couple years. The technology isn't ready, the cost of the cars would likely be prohibitive for mass appeal and there are few American manufacturers of some of the necessary technology. Toyota, GM and Ford have all announced intentions to introduce PHEV vehicles in the coming years. Some of those prototype cars boast gas mileage north of 100 miles per gallon. But the numbers are squishy. One example is the Chevy Volt, a plug-in hybrid scheduled to hit the market in late 2010. The way these cars work, it would run purely on electricity, without emitting exhaust, for up to 40 miles. Then it would switch over to a gas motor, which would also recharge the battery (much as a standard hybrid works today). If the car is only used for relatively short trips, it would achieve gas mileage ratings like the ones cited by Clinton. But if you drive longer distances, the gas mileage rating goes down. A GM official in March estimated the cost, before tax incentives, might be about $48,000. "Broadly speaking, she (Clinton) is correct" about the prototypes' potential mileage, said Mike Millikin, founder and editor of Green Car Congress, a Web site for information on eco-friendly auto technology. The question then is whether, with a presidential push, these kinds of cars could be mass produced "in a couple years" and whether there would be a market if they could. People with expertise in auto technology are wary, at best. "I think that's pretty dubious other than in small, symbolic numbers," said John DeCicco, a senior fellow of automotive strategies for the Environmental Defense Fund. DeCicco said new cars get about 25 miles per gallon so to go from there to 100 miles per gallon in "a couple years," is unrealistic. First off, these cars are prototypes. Automakers have yet to work out issues like durability, reliability and safety, said Jennifer Moore, a spokeswoman with Ford Motor Co., which is working on a plug-in hybrid. "It is not a small step from prototype to mass commercialization," Moore said. Technology aside, there's also the question of whether the public would be willing to buy the cars. "Cost is clearly an issue," Moore said. Currently, it would cost about $20,000 for a battery needed to power a plug-in hybrid car, Millikin said. That's over and above the cost of the car itself. Clinton's plan for a $10,000 tax rebate for people who buy the cars is a good start, Millikin said, but it's not enough to cover the added cost. DeCicco said the country couldn't possibly afford to pay $10,000 tax rebates to enough people to make a significant dent in getting to where we want to be. There are 16-million new cars sold in the United States each year. "You just can't bribe everyone to buy a supercar," DeCicco said. Tax credits given to those who bought hybrids "haven't really moved the needle," he noted. There are a lot of factors besides gas mileage that go into a consumer's decision to buy a car, things like personal image and driving needs. There's another issue with the batteries. There is not an advanced lithium ion battery (the kind used by the plug-in hybrids) supplier or manufacturing base in the United States. We'd need one if the point is to decrease dependence on foreign energy sources. "We don't want to substitute one imported fuel with another imported fuel technology," said Edward Kjaer, director of electric transportation for Southern California Edison, which has partnered with Ford to develop plug-in hybrid prototypes. Millikin said Clinton's plan would require a sea change in the auto industry. "The likelihood of that, at this point in time, is not very good," Millikin said. Said DeCicco: "You can't transform an industry overnight just with prototypes. We've been there and done that and it didn't work. She (Clinton) should know." A similar Apollo-style program for hyper fuel-efficient cars was initiated under Bill Clinton's administration in the 1990s. Introduced in a Rose Garden ceremony and funded with a billion dollars in government money, the so-called Supercar project, formally known as the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles, was a joint venture between the government and the Big Three automakers to create marketable and affordable ultra fuel-efficient cars. It resulted in hybrid prototypes and, in fact, the GM prototype topped the 100 miles per gallon threshold, DeCicco said. But none made it past the concept phase. Still, the industry is working on it. And several manufacturers plan to introduce plug-in hybrids in the coming years. The potential upside is massive, said Kjaer. "It could be a game-changer for the energy industry," he said. Obstacles like technology advances and cost will improve, Kjaer said. Advances in battery technology are progressing quickly, he said. And if the plug-in hybrids start to take off, he said, it will create a volume base for battery companies, which will bring down the cost of batteries. Many experts agree much will depend on the public's view of the immediacy of global warming. Perhaps even more important, the public's response probably will be determined by whether gas prices continue to skyrocket. Lee Schipper, an energy expert and visiting fellow at University of California at Berkeley, said Clinton is weakening her case for the high-mileage cars by urging a holiday on gas taxes to lower the price per gallon during the summer. "Bringing a prototype to market to save fuel really takes convincing both companies to make them and a buying public convinced that high oil prices are here to stay," he said. "Candidates cannot both expect the prototypes to appear and try to argue for lower oil prices." Clinton is correct about there being prototypes that get more than 100 miles per gallon (at least according to some measures). But experts believe it is unlikely these plug-in hybrids will or even could be mass produced in just a "couple years" — as Clinton suggests. We hate to rain on Clinton's optimism, but the fact is that she significantly overstates the status of high-mileage vehicles. Best we can do is Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-09732	Health proposal would create a "40% tax on health care benefits of middle-class workers."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/21/health-care-america-now/excise-tax-cadillac-middle-class/	Unions are usually supporters of the Democratic plans for health reform, but there's one thing they don't like: an excise tax on high-dollar health care plans, popularly known as "Cadillac" plans. Health Care for America Now, a coalition that includes unions, has launched an ad attacking the excise tax, which was included in a version of health reform authored by Sen. Max Baucus and approved by the Senate Finance Committee on Oct. 13. Here's what the ad says: "We all know America needs real health care reform, but there's a right way and a wrong way to pay for it. Some senators say they want to tax so-called 'Cadillac' health care plans, but those proposals will also tax the benefits of millions of middle-class workers. There's a better way. Let's ask individuals making more than $250,000 to pay their fair share." We're checking the facts behind the text that flashes on the screen during the ad: "40% tax on health care benefits of middle-class workers." The excise tax works in a roundabout way. Under the Senate Finance proposal, insurance companies would have to pay a 40 percent excise tax on health insurance policies that exceed $8,000 for individuals and $21,000 for families. We spoke with three economists on both the left and the right, and they all agreed that insurance companies will not simply absorb the new tax; they will pass it along in the form of higher premiums. Employers will then try to avoid the new higher costs by buying cheaper health plans. Finally, the economists agreed that if employers have to scale back on health plans, they will eventually pay higher wages as they seek to retain workers. At this point, disgruntled workers may say "Yeah, right," but the economists were adamant that it is the case. Those higher wages are taxable, and that's how it becomes a tax increase for workers. An analysis from the Joint Committee on Taxation, which is nonpartisan and advises Congress on tax policy, confirmed this point. The Joint Committee found that many people affected by this make less than $200,000. (For more details on this Joint Committee analysis, see our report on someone else who doesn't like the excise tax: Sarah Palin .) So here's what that means: If workers end up getting paid more, they'll also be taxed more. Another point worth emphasizing is that the 40 percent tax is on the portion of the health plan that exceeds $8,000 for individuals and $21,000 for families. It's not on the whole plan. We should point out here that many workers have no idea what their health plans cost. How do you know if you have a "Cadillac" plan? If you're sick of paying more and more out of pocket for health care, you probably don't have a Cadillac plan. On the other hand, if you feel like your health plan is quite generous, you might. These are plans that generally have very low co-pays and lots of extras. A Boston Globe report described one plan for state employees in New Hampshire as offering free surgery, low-cost prescriptions, free rehab for alcoholism, a stipend for gym memberships and reimbursements for yoga classes. CEOs have these types of plans, but so do some unionized workers. An economist we spoke with said they are commonly offered by state and local governments and universities, the types of jobs that are said to have "great benefits." Estimates we've looked at suggest that, by 2019, the excise tax would affect as many as 25 percent and as few as 17 percent of all tax filers. The ad says the proposal is a "40% tax on health care benefits of middle-class workers." But that's an overstatement that fails to mention it's an excise tax that would only affect workers with health care benefits above a certain level. Most middle-class workers won't be affected at all. We rate the statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Health Care for America Now	None	None	None	2009-10-21T18:03:33	2009-10-15	['None']
pomt-14376	Says Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland "voted, so the folks know, in Washington, D.C., to keep guns away from private citizens."	false	/punditfact/statements/2016/mar/18/bill-oreilly/bill-oreilly-wrongly-says-merrick-garland-voted-ba/	Even if Republican senators agree to consider President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, his record on gun rights alone will stop his confirmation, says Fox News host Bill O’Reilly. On his show March 16, O’Reilly acknowledged that Obama’s pick — Merrick Garland, chief judge of the federal court of appeals for the D.C. circuit— is "not some crazy left-wing bomb thrower." "But he voted, so the folks know, in Washington, D.C., to keep guns away from private citizens, and the Supreme Court of course said no, that is unconstitutional," O’Reilly added. "But he voted to keep the guns away. Just that vote, and you must know this, alienates most in the Republican Party, so they never would vote to confirm him." A few conservative groups and figures have already attacked Garland for his position on guns since his nomination. We’re putting O’Reilly’s specific claim that Garland voted "to keep guns away from private citizens" on the Truth-O-Meter. D.C. gun ban O’Reilly’s statement refers to a landmark case on gun rights, District of Columbia vs. Heller. In its 2008 ruling, the Supreme Court found that Washington’s gun regulations — essentially amounting to a ban on handguns in the home — were unconstitutional. This ruling was significant because it was the first time the court held that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual’s right to own a firearm for self defense. Up until Heller, the widespread understanding of the Second Amendment was that the right to bear arms did not necessarily extend beyond militia service. Before the case went to the Supreme Court, though, it appeared in the federal court of appeals for the D.C. circuit, where Garland has been a judge since 1997, as Parker vs. District of Columbia. In a 2-1 decision, a panel of three D.C. Circuit judges came to the same conclusion as the Supreme Court: The Washington handgun ban was unconstitutional. Based on O’Reilly’s claim, one might assume that the single dissenting vote in this D.C. Circuit opinion belonged to Garland. However, it was Judge Karen Henderson who dissented, while Judges Laurence Silberman and Thomas Griffith signed the majority opinion. Garland didn’t vote on this case at all. After the D.C. Circuit handed down its 2007 decision, the city of Washington asked the court to rehear the case en banc, meaning all of the court’s judges would reconsider the case, not just the panel of three. The court ended up denying the city’s petition, but Garland was among the group of D.C. Circuit judges who was in favor of rehearing the case. It’s not fair to conclude that Garland supported the Washington gun regulations because he wanted to reconsider the case, as he did not take a formal position on the merits of the case. Rehearing a case en banc is generally used when a case goes against precedent or presents a question of significant importance, and that was true of the Heller case. D.C. Circuit Judge A. Raymond Randolph, a well-known conservative, joined Garland in voting to reconsider the case. And the Bush administration, though supportive of the notion that the Second Amendment protects individual rights, filed an amicus brief to the Supreme Court asking them to send Heller back to the lower courts for consideration, noted Adam Winkler, a Second Amendment law expert at the University of California Los Angeles Law School. "Garland voted for his court to consider the constitutionality of D.C.'s law," Winkler said. "Such a vote does not tell us one way or another how Garland feels about the Second Amendment." We should also note another case, which some critics say indicates that Garland has a left-leaning opinion of the Second Amendment. In 2000, he joined the majority opinion in a 2-1 finding that the FBI could hold on to gun purchase records for six months for auditing purposes, to make sure the instant background check systems worked. The National Rifle Association called the six-month record retention an "illegal national registration of gun owners," while the court found that it was a common-sense auditing system, not a national firearm registry, according to news reports from the time. Our ruling O’Reilly said Merrick Garland "voted, so the folks know, in Washington, D.C., to keep guns away from private citizens." Garland never heard the case about Washington gun laws from the bench, and so he never voted on it. He voted in favor of reconsidering the case, but it’s impossible to extrapolate from that vote his position on the merits of the case. We rate O’Reilly’s claim False.

pomt-01636	"Over the last 40 years, real wage growth has been flatlined because of the policies of the Federal Reserve ... It was all driven by the Federal Reserve."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/aug/26/herman-cain/herman-cain-says-wages-flat-thanks-federal-reserve/	Earlier this year, President Barack Obama asked Congress to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10, following a national conversation about wages and income inequality. But according to 2012 Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain, a higher minimum wage isn’t enough, since the real value of paychecks hasn’t budged in four decades. Appearing on Aug. 11’s Varney and Co. on Fox News Business, Cain criticized former Bill Clinton labor secretary Robert Reich who blamed a rise in income inequality on the financial elite. Cain told host Stuart Varney it’s the Federal Reserve that is responsible. "This is a fact, Stuart, over the last 40 years, real wage growth has been flatlined because of the policies of the Federal Reserve," Cain said. "It had nothing to do with greedy CEOs, nothing to do with what companies wanted to do. It was all driven by the Federal Reserve trying to control unemployment with the faulty control of wage growth." We wanted to see if real wages -- which is a worker’s salary adjusted for inflation -- have indeed seen no growth for four decades and whether that could be tied to Federal Reserve policies. Cain’s research associate Rich Lowrie, his former economic adviser and one of the creators of Cain’s 9-9-9 tax plan, referred us to this video. The video takes its data from the World Top Incomes Database, a project of leading economists whose calculations are based off of income tax records. As for the theory that the Fed’s policies are responsible for real wage stagnation, that was Lowrie’s and other Cain researchers’ independent conclusion. "We think it’s unmistakable that there is a connection," Lowrie said. For this fact-check, we talked to Lowrie, researchers at think thanks with various political leanings, and a number of independent economists. What we found was that this claim is about competing theories on labor economics and monetary policy. Cain's viewpoint is an outlier. Incoming fail We’ll start by assessing Cain’s claim that real wage growth has flatlined over the past 40 years. Later we’ll talk about the role of the Federal Reserve. Cain got the stat after analyzing data from a reputable source, the World Top Incomes Database. But Cain off the bat made a mistake of describing his analysis as measuring wage growth. Really, the statistics he looked at measure income growth. (Wages refers to the paychecks a worker receives within a certain time frame and constitute a part of income. Income also includes investments, rent checks, and other sources of incoming cash.) Between 1972 and 2012, real income has grown by an average of 0.52 percent from year to year. Paltry growth, but growth. Lowrie, a corporate financial adviser, said Cain was focusing on a group Lowrie called the "striving majority," the bottom 90 percent of American wage earners. Real income for that group has actually decreased annually at an average 0.16 percent, according to the World Top Incomes Database. As you can see, income growth hasn’t literally flatlined -- it’s bounced up and down a bit. Real income growth was the most stagnant in the 1970s, but saw some gains in the 1990s before falling in the 2000s. Cain "just ignores the ups and downs," said Mark Bils, a professor of macroeconomics at the University of Rochester. "Forty years is a long span." And average incomes, even adjusted for inflation, don’t capture the differences in working conditions between 1972 and today, according to Bils. Working hours are different and purchasing power has risen. All quiet on the wage front What happens when we focus on wages? Josh Bivens, research and policy director at the liberal think tank Economic Policy Institute, looked at real wage growth from 1979 to 2013, using data from the Bureau of Labor Economics. The results show that Americans who earn less have seen very little wage growth while top earners have made gains. For the 70th percentile workers (those who make more than 70 percent of all workers), hourly wages saw virtually no growth between 1979 and 1995. The years 1995 to 2000 were an exception, with an annualized growth rate of 1.4 percent. So in sum, if you factor in inflation, the average American has been bringing home the same amount of bacon for the past four decades, while the economic elite earn more from year to year. That doesn’t necessarily tell the entire story, economists told us, noting that wages do not factor in things like health benefits, tuition assistance, vacation time and sick leave. But by Cain’s yardstick, he is largely correct. Federal reservations Cain, however, did not simply say wage growth has flatlined. He blamed the Federal Reserve. That view is an outlier. According to Bivens, the claim is "not very grounded." John Makin, a former economist at Federal Reserve banks in Chicago and Atlanta currently at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, and University of California, Berkeley labor economist Michael Reich said they have not seen any research that ties Federal Reserve policies to real wages flatlining. Both Makin and Reich (a colleague of Robert Reich’s, but no relation) pointed out that neither Cain nor Lowrie are economists. At best, the Federal Reserve has "a marginal effect on the long term trend of real wage growth," said Kenneth Rogoff, author of This Time is Different and a professor economics and public policy at Harvard University. Though economists don’t give much credence to the general claim, they helped us dissect Cain’s theories, which boil down to how the Fed affixes the value of the dollar, how the Fed sets interest rates, and how the Fed defines and measures inflation. Fed policies, according to the Fed Fed policies, according to Cain and Lowrie Real wages Cannot directly affect real wages, which is determined by largely nonmonetary factors. Treat real wages as inflation, thus intentionally kept stable. Inflation Aim for inflation rate of 2% to stabilize prices and maximize employment Keep inflation down and thus real wages as well. Price index Use the personal price expenditures index largely, as well as many other indices, to measure inflation. Use the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to measure inflation, but in reality substitute real wages for the CPI. Value of the dollar Do not target the exchange value, but take into account the effect of the dollar on the U.S. economy. Used to measure inflation, keeping the value stable. Now float the dollar, letting the value fluctuate. Sources: Federal Reserve FAQ and interviews with Lowrie The dollar Lowrie pinpoints 1971 as the year when real income began to flatline, which is also the year when the United States stopped tying its currency to gold. The theory goes that when the dollar was backed by gold, real wages were growing increasingly; and when the gold exchange standard was nixed, the dollar began to float -- subject to fluctuation on the foreign currency and exchange markets -- and wages flatlined. With a stable currency, material costs for businesses flatlined and thus rose wages, Lowrie said. This is the debased currency argument -- a floating dollar has less purchasing power, leading to inflation and thus depreciating real wages -- and one virtually all economists are skeptical of. At best, the theory is "hand-wavy," according to Bivens. "You would really need to see an increase in inflation for this to make sense, and that’s not the story of the past decades for sure," he said. What’s more, the value of the dollar is largely under the U.S. Treasury’s purview, not the Fed’s. Interest rates According to Lowrie, the Fed will lower interest rates when the economy is expanding, making it easier for businesses to borrow money and boosting wealth. When the economy begins to contract, the Fed raises interest rates to curb inflation but instead leading to less investment in business and thus a decrease in wages. Lowrie's description of interest rate policies sits well with economists. Bivens said that the Fed is certainly "quick on the trigger" when it comes to enacting policies that heat up and cool down the economy, potentially affecting wages immediately. But the idea that policies have a direct or even significant impact on real wages is a tall order, experts said. "Productivity has grown steadily over the postwar period, but only since 1980 have real wages failed to grow with productivity growth. Interest rate policy has not changed during that period," Reich said. While it’s true that higher interest rates generally increase unemployment and slow nominal wage growth (not adjusted for inflation) in the time immediately following the hikes, they don’t do much for real wages, according to Reich. "Over 40 years, it’s not going to matter," said Bils. "Maybe they create some asset run-rups in the short term, but it doesn’t follow that wages would decrease." Inflation Lowrie’s third point suggests that the Fed treats real wages as inflation and attempts to keep growth down to keep inflation down. Lowrie said the Fed uses lagging data, namely the CPI, to measure inflation but because the data doesn’t reflect the market in real time, the Fed defaults to using real wages as a proxy. Since part of the objective of the Fed is to stabilize prices, they stabilize real wages instead. Economists take issue with the characterization of how inflation is measured. The Fed focuses on general rises in prices, not wages, to evaluate inflation, but to predict inflation, other factors like GDP growth and unemployment are also taken into account. Bivens compared it to baseball projections. "Looking at strikeouts and walks is a better predictor of wins than past wins," he said. And according to Makin, the very definition of inflation means that real wages can’t be its proxy, because doing so would discount the other part of the equation -- wages. "Real wages are nominal wages adjusted for inflation," he said. "If the Fed caused the price level to rise more rapidly, then prices would rise faster than money, and real wages would go (down) fast. If prices rise slowly, then real wages would go up." In other words, in order for real wages to grow, nominal wage growth would have to rise faster than inflation. Since inflation has been below the Fed’s goal of 2 percent, it’s the lack of nominal wage growth that’s keeping real wages down. In real-wage-ality If it’s not the Fed, what’s actually been holding real wages down? Economists attribute it to many factors. An economist at the Fed itself wrote that labor market conditions are to blame. Bils listed changes in technology, risk taking and investing, and human capital. There’s also increased international trade, fluctuating demand for different skill levels and income tax policy, said Stephen Moore, a former senior economist at the congressional Joint Economic Committee who now works at the conservative Heritage Foundation. Makin and Biven pointed to a rise in labor productivity combined with a weak demand for labor. And Reich said all of the above: increased competition from low-wage countries, technological change that has reduced the need for jobs in the mid-level pay scales, while encouraging growth in low-paid occupations, the decline of unions and the decline of real minimum wages. "While professional economists' opinions on the relative importance of each of these varies, I have never seen a statement that Fed policies regarding inflation are at all a factor," Reich said. Our ruling Cain said, "Over the last 40 years, real wage growth has been flatlined because of the policies of the Federal Reserve." Cain’s research associate was looking at real income growth, but the findings are consistent if you measure income or wages. In short, wage growth has remain relatively flat. But Cain goes too far in blaming policies of the Federal Reserve, both conservative and liberal economists told us us. Various nonmonetary policy factors are much more likely to cause a lack of wage growth. Cain’s claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.	None	Herman Cain	None	None	None	2014-08-26T09:58:29	2014-08-11	['Federal_Reserve_System']
pomt-09925	Says President Obama was wrong "about Muslims' historical contributions to mankind, such as algebra (actually that was the ancient Babylonians), the compass (that was the Chinese), pens (the Chinese again) and medical discoveries."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jun/19/ann-coulter/ann-coulter-criticizes-obama-muslim-history/	Conservatives had lots of reasons to criticize President Barack Obama’s speech in Cairo. Some thought Obama went too far in praising his Muslim audience, some thought he was too harsh on Israel, and some thought he shouldn’t have been there in the first place. Ann Coulter had her own angle. She went after Obama's accuracy. "Obama listed, incorrectly, Muslims' historical contributions to mankind, such as algebra (actually that was the ancient Babylonians), the compass (that was the Chinese), pens (the Chinese again) and medical discoveries (huh?)," she wrote in a June 10, 2009, op-ed on the Human Events Web site. (The words in parentheses are Coulter's as they appeared in the column.) She said Obama was ingratiating himself to the same community that launched the 9/11 attacks. "All these inventions came in mighty handy on Sept. 11, 2001! Thanks, Muslims!!" she wrote. Here's exactly what Obama said in the Cairo speech: "As a student of history, I also know civilization's debt to Islam," said Obama in his June 4, 2009, speech. "It was Islam — at places like Al-Azhar — that carried the light of learning through so many centuries, paving the way for Europe's Renaissance and Enlightenment. ... It was innovation in Muslim communities that developed the order of algebra; our magnetic compass and tools of navigation; our mastery of pens and printing; our understanding of how disease spreads and how it can be healed." Obama's larger point is that elements of Islamic culture are found throughout Western society. "I consider it part of my responsibility as president of the United States to fight against negative stereotypes of Islam wherever they appear," he said. So, what of these inventions that Obama praised and Coulter critiqued? Was he wrong? Our friends at FactCheck.org already did some digging and found he was generally correct, but we wanted to address Coulter's criticism more directly. Let's start with Obama's assertion about algebra. (Don't worry. We're dealing with history here, but no linear equations.) Indeed, algebra does have roots in Islam. Baghdad-born Abu Ja'far Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi is "the father of algebra" according to the United Kingdom-based Foundation for Science Technology and Civilization, an organization devoted to explaining Muslim contributions to science. His seminal work, Hisab al-jabr w'al-muqabala — or The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing — was written in 820 A.D. and is widely considered the first book on algebra. In fact, the world al-jabr from the title is the root of the word "algebra." Nevertheless, others have contributed to algebra, including Diophantus, a Greek who some historians say should share the prestige of being the father of algebra with al-Khwarizmi. Diophantus lived some time between 200 and 298 A.D., some 500 years before al-Khwarizmi. His book, Arithmetica , is significant because it prompted the rebirth of number theory, or the study of positive numbers, according to Encyclopedia Britannica . Regardless, al-Khwarizmi's role in developing algebra is largely without dispute. And though the Babylonians did live in what we consider modern-day Baghdad, Coulter incorrectly identifies the origins of algebra. Moving on to navigation and the creation of the compass, Coulter is correct that Obama is on shakier ground. While many cultures used primitive navigation devices, the Chinese are usually credited with popularizing the magnetic compass, which, in its earliest form, involved a magnetized spoon-shaped stone that aligned with Earth's magnetic field. There is strong evidence, however, that Muslims made navigation tools easier to use; an astronomer named Azarchel, for example, created an all-in-one astrolabe, a device used to determine direction using the constellations. Writing instruments come from ancient Egypt, where people used pens made from river reeds to inscribe papyrus. However, Al-Mu'izz, a Muslim who ruled Egypt from 953 to 975, is credited with inventing the fountain pen. So, Obama's claim that the "mastery" of pens originated in the Muslim world is in the ballpark. Printing, however, is decidedly of Asian origins; the Chinese and Koreans developed woodblock and movable type printing. And around 1440 A.D., a German named Johannas Gutenburg invented the printing press, his most well known project being the Gutenburg Bible. Obama overstates the role Muslims played in printing. He would have been more accurate if he pointed out that followers of Mohammed were instrumental in disseminating the printed word, according to Jonathan M. Bloom's Paper Before Print: The History and Impact of Paper in the Islamic World . Lastly, Obama contends that Muslims developed certain aspects of modern medicine, which is partly true. According to the National Institutes of Health, the Greeks influenced healing practices in the Islamic world, but then the work of many Muslims influenced the ideas and practices in late medieval Europe from which early modern medicine eventually arose. Dr. Max Gross of Georgetown University's Prince Alwaleed Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding said it’s fair to say that Muslims created or contributed significantly to all the inventions Obama outlined in his speech. "I have no difficulties with what Obama said," said Gross. Nevertheless, Gross pointed out that innovation can develop in different places at nearly the same time, so there is inevitably some disagreement with where certain tools or ideas originate. He used the astrolabe to emphasize his point. Muslims did not "create all navigation tools, they refined the astrolabe," he said. "The astrolabe is what Europeans used to navigate the oceans." Let’s review this little history lesson by revisiting Obama's words. He didn't say Muslims were the sole inventors of these disciplines, he merely said their innovation contributed to the development of disciplines. We find Coulter is incorrect about Obama's statement about algebra, that she's largely right about navigation, that she's wrong about pens and that it's fuzzy about how much Muslims contributed to modern medicine. So we find her criticism to be Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-02828	On changing the rules for filibusters on presidential nominees	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/22/mitch-mcconnell/mitch-mcconnell-among-flip-floppers-senates-nuclea/	"To correct this abuse, the majority in the Senate is prepared to restore the Senate’s traditions and precedents to ensure that regardless of party, any president’s judicial nominees, after full and fair debate, receive a simple up-or-down vote on the Senate floor. It is time to move away from advise and obstruct and get back to advise and consent." Sen. Mitch McConnell, remarks on Senate floor, May 19, 2005 "Let me say we are not interested in having a gun put to our head any longer. If you think this is in the best interests of the Senate and the American people to make advise and consent, in effect, mean nothing—obviously you can break the rules to change the rules to achieve that. But some of us have been around here long enough to know that the shoe is sometimes on the other foot." Sen. Mitch McConnell, remarks on the Senate floor, Nov. 21, 2013 After years of partisan threats and retreats, the Democratic Senate majority on Nov. 21, 2013, enacted a controversial rule change called the "nuclear option." The change eliminated the filibuster -- a blockage of floor action, typically by the chamber’s minority party -- for executive branch nominations as well as judicial appointments short of the Supreme Court. Under the new rule, the Senate only needs a 51-vote majority instead of a 60-vote supermajority to end a filibuster and move to a final vote on a nomination. The question of whether to change the rule has long divided the chamber’s majority and its minority. In fact, supporting or opposing the "nuclear option" has been much more closely linked to a senator’s position in the majority or the minority than whether they’re a Republican or Democrat. This means that both Republicans and Democrats made different arguments in this recent faceoff than they had in previous iterations of the battle. Before and after Thursday’s vote, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., strongly condemned the nuclear option. He even accused the Democrats of breaking the Senate rules by going through with the change, which was then implemented with the support of all but a few Democrats and no Republicans. But eight years ago, when McConnell was the majority whip of a then-Republican Senate, he supported invoking the nuclear option himself. Time to take out the Flip-O-Meter! PolitiFact’s Flip-O-Meter rates politicians' consistency on particular topics from No Flip to Full Flop. The meter is not intended to pass judgment on whether the change is justified or not. It simply looks at whether they did, indeed, change their stated position. We’ll take a look back to 2005, when the partisan lineup was substantially different. President George W. Bush had recently won a second term, while his fellow Republicans had a majority in the Senate. (The House was also controlled by Republicans, but the House isn’t directly involved in the filibuster fight.) In the Senate, the Democratic minority had filibustered a number of Bush’s judicial appointments, displeasing Republicans who started a campaign to stop any more such filibusters by invoking the nuclear option. McConnell, at the time the second-highest-ranking Republican in the chamber, described his party’s plan in a speech on the Senate floor on May 19, 2005: "The majority in the Senate is prepared to restore the Senate’s traditions and precedents to ensure that regardless of party, any president’s judicial nominees, after full and fair debate, receive a simple up-or-down vote on the Senate floor." "It is time to move away from advise and obstruct and get back to advise and consent," he added. The threat to go nuclear eventually went away when a bipartisan group of senators – the "Gang of 14" – signed a memorandum to block the effort. Seven Republicans promised not to vote with their colleagues to invoke the nuclear option, while in turn seven Democrats agreed to no longer support their party’s filibusters on judicial nominees. Fast-forward to 2013. Now, Democrats held the White House and a Senate majority. The Republican minority had been stalling nominations and appointments by Obama, including filibustering the nomination of former Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel for secretary of defense. Senate Democrats decided to go nuclear after the Senate GOP made clear that they had no intention of allowing three vacancies on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to be filled. Led by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., they successfully invoked the rule change in a near-party-line vote, 52-48. The nuclear option was met with a storm of protest by the Senate Republicans, who took the opposite view of the one they expressed had in 2005. In a last push before the actual vote, Minority Leader McConnell said, "we are not interested in having a gun put to our head any longer. If you think this is in the best interests of the Senate and the American people to make advise and consent, in effect, mean nothing — obviously you can break the rules to change the rules to achieve that," McConnell said on the Senate floor. Then he added: "Some of us have been around here long enough to know that the shoe is sometimes on the other foot." This acknowledged the time when he was in the majority. In a press conference after the rule change went through, McConnell further lamented the decision: "I think it's a time to be sad about what's been done to the United States Senate, the greatest deliberative body in the world," he said. Our ruling In 2005, McConnell was part of the Republican majority that proposed a "nuclear option" rule change. This week, when the Democratic majority enacted a nuclear option, he strongly condemned it. We rate this a Full Flop.	None	Mitch McConnell	None	None	None	2013-11-22T18:33:15	2013-11-21	['None']
pomt-06310	"[A]n extra 8 million Americans [are] projected to join state Medicaid programs in the next few years."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2011/nov/15/phil-gingrey/gingrey-says-8-million-extra-people-join-medicaid/	U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey thinks states need financial wiggle room in these tight times, and is offering health care legislation to give them room to stretch. Gingrey’s 2011 State Flexibility Act would nix a lesser-known requirement of last year’s health care reform bill that critics think would make Medicaid, the federal government’s health care program for the poor, too costly for states. "With an extra 8 million Americans projected to join state Medicaid programs in the next few years, state governments need the flexibility to make cost-saving reforms to Medicaid in order to balance their budgets," Gingrey, a Marietta Republican, said in a Sept. 15 press release. We know Medicaid is supposed to grow because of health care overhaul, but what’s this about an "extra" 8 million people? Gingrey’s point was that updated estimates published after the passage of last year’s Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act show that there will be millions more people eligible for Medicaid than legislators were originally told, Gingrey spokeswoman Brooke Sammon said. This means health care reform will be even more costly than lawmakers anticipated, and states need the help that Gingrey’s bill provides. Is that true? Before we delve into Gingrey’s claim, here’s more on the 2011 State Flexibility Act, which repeals certain federal restrictions on Medcaid funds. The federal government generally pays half or more of the Medicaid bill. The remainder falls to the states, which administer the program and set some of its rules. The federal dollars come with strings attached. The state has to distribute the Medicaid money; State rules have to meet basic federal requirements. Health care reform expands Medicaid in 2014 to give coverage to people with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. This change could be costly, so some states want to drop some federal requirements to ease their budget troubles. Backers of the State Flexibility Act want to give these states the leeway they want. Bill opponents say allowing these changes could leave hundreds of thousands of people, most of them children, uninsured. Now, let’s take a look at Gingrey’s claim. As you’ll recall, his point is that 8 million more people are projected to sign up for the program than legislators were originally told. There’s little doubt that health care reform will increase the overall number of people on Medicaid. But Gingrey’s take on the facts is flawed. While legislators battled over the reforms in 2009 and 2010, the Congressional Budget Office, which reviews legislation that could impact the federal budget, issued cost projections. They also estimated how much Medicaid enrollment would grow. About five months after the legislation passed, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which helps administer Medicaid, issued its own estimates. Its numbers were higher than the CBO’s. By 2014, the CBO expects that Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which covers low-income kids who aren’t qualified for Medicaid, will cover 9 million more Americans than it would have without reforms. It would be 16 million in 2016, then 17 million in 2021. By 2014, CMS expects rolls for Medicaid and CHIP will be 23.3 million higher in 2014, then drop to slightly more than 20 million in 2018 and 2019. CMS published its estimate Oct. 2010 in Health Affairs, a peer-reviewed health policy journal. There is a big gap between the CMS and CBO estimates, though Gingrey’s number is a bit off. The difference varies from about 4 million to more than 14 million, not 8 million, depending on the year. But the higher CMS estimate is not an update of the CBO figure. Instead, they are two separate projections based on different data and assumptions. They’re not comparable. Medicaid is such a complicated program that calculating enrollment is tougher than you’d think. CBO bases its enrollment numbers on the Survey of Income and Program Participation, which is conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. CMS’ projections use the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, which is conducted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Also, the CBO predicts that the percent of eligible people who join Medicaid will remain roughly the same under health care reform, said Benjamin Sommers, a Harvard University professor who has studied Medicaid enrollment. CMS assumes that a far greater percentage will sign up. Another difference is that CMS expects enrollment will spike immediately after Medicaid expands in 2014. But the CBO thinks enrollment will take place gradually, their charts show. The estimates become more similar over time, Sommers noted. Projections by independent groups also vary, but those we reviewed are in line with CBO and CMS estimates. For example, the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation’s Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured said that enrollment would be between 15.9 million and 22.8 million higher, depending on how eager people are to join, and the success of the outreach effort. The Urban Institute estimated that 16.8 million more people would be covered by Medicaid if health care reform took effect in 2010. How do we rule? The fact that CBO estimates released in March 2010 were lower than CMS estimates released later that year is not proof that "extra people" will join Medicaid, as Gingrey said. Different government agencies simply arrived at different results, based on different data and assumptions. Since they’re making projections for an unprecedented overhaul in the country’s health care system, it’s reasonable for their results to vary. All projections foresee a major increase in Medicaid rolls, and Gingrey rightly noted a significant difference between two federal estimates. But he made a mistake when he understood CMS’ estimate as an update of the CBO figures. Gingrey’s statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context. We therefore rate his claim Half True.	None	Phil Gingrey	None	None	None	2011-11-15T06:00:00	2011-09-15	['United_States']
pomt-00413	Wisconsin is "49th out of 50 states in infrastructure."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/aug/30/tony-evers/tony-evers-cherry-picks-old-statistic-claiming-wis/	At a rally for Democrats who had won their primaries, Tony Evers lamented that various things he described as Wisconsin values "have been trashed." "Another thing that’s a Wisconsin value is infrastructure, whether it’s roads or bridges," the party’s gubernatorial nominee said in Madison on Aug. 16, 2018, two days after the elections. "My God," he declared, "we are 49th out of 50 states in infrastructure." Are Wisconsin’s bones in such bad shape? Evers made the 49th-in-infrastructure claim before he defeated seven other Democrats to win the nomination. And he has made it clear he’ll criticize Republican Gov. Scott Walker on infrastructure ahead of the general election. There’s room to criticize Walker on infrastructure, particularly when it comes to roads. But Evers went beyond just roads in making his claim. And he cherry picked a ranking that is too-narrow and not up to date. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. ‘Infrastructure’ definitions vary Let’s start by noting there is not a universal definition of infrastructure, as various rankings show. U.S. News & World Report, in its "Best States 2017" ratings," ranked Wisconsin 39th in infrastructure — which included an assortment of factors, such as roads, bridges, renewable energy usage, broadband access and others. Road quality was where Wisconsin ranked 49th. That’s where Evers got his statistic. Tens of millions in tax money directed to a Milwaukee streetcar at the expense of police, schools? Mostly False. But again, roads are only one part of infrastructure. And there are at least three more recent rankings on infrastructure — including the current one by U.S. News -- where Wisconsin is in the middle, or even higher: U.S. News & World Report: In the magazine’s "2018 Best States" report, released in February 2018, Wisconsin ranked 26th overall on infrastructure. That included a ranking of 14th in energy — for electricity price, power grid reliability and renewable energy usage; 41st in internet access — for broadband access and ultra-fast internet access; and 34th in transportation — for road quality and bridge quality, commute time and public transit usage. (Specifically on road quality, Wisconsin ranked 44th, up a bit from 49th.) Wisconsin is "49th in the country in internet speed." Half True. CNBC: The business news TV network said it evaluated road and bridge quality, commute time, the availability of air travel and other factors to rank the states on infrastructure. For 2018, Wisconsin ranked 23rd. 24/7 Wall Street: The financial news website ranked the states in early August 2018 with an index using the share of bridges, roads and dams that are "in a state of disrepair or potentially hazardous," and it looked at state highway spending per person. On that measure of infrastructure, Wisconsin ranked 15th — as in 15th worst, as this ranking was done differently. All our fact checks in the governor’s race. We’ll also note that the American Society of Civil Engineers rates the nation’s infrastructure in 16 categories, including roads and bridges. Its most recent report, for 2017, gave the nation a grade of D+. That report says that in Wisconsin, "driving on roads in need of repair" costs each driver $637 per year and 8.7 percent of the state’s bridges are rated structurally deficient. But the report doesn’t give grades to the states and doesn’t rank the states. It’s also worth noting, with regard to roads, that we rated Mostly False a Walker claim that he had invested $3 billion more in the state’s transportation system than his predecessor did. And our rating was Mostly False when Walker said state road projects "are staying on track or getting done sooner." Our rating Evers says Wisconsin is "49th out of 50 states in infrastructure." His statement relies on a too-narrow ranking that isn’t current, and it ignores other rankings. In 2017, U.S. News & World Report ranked Wisconsin 49th in road quality — but 39th in overall infrastructure, based not only on roads but bridges, renewable energy usage, broadband access and other factors. Moreover, the magazine’s 2018 report ranks Wisconsin 26th in infrastructure. And Wisconsin is well above the bottom, though not great, in two other national rankings. We rate Evers’ statement False.

Elizabeth Coggs, D-Milwaukee, claims "millions of dollars in tax breaks" were paid for "by busting unions, cutting BadgerCare, and raising taxes on the poor and the middle class, thanks to Elizabeth Coggs' help." In a word: Really? Walker’s legislative changes in 2011 transformed him into a Republican star and one of the nation’s most divisive political figures. And yet the group circulating the material, We Are Milwaukee, claims a Democratic Assembly member helped make it all possible. Distribution of it comes ahead of the Aug. 14, 2012 primary election in which Coggs and four other Democrats are seeking the seat being vacated by Coggs' cousin -- state Sen. Spencer Coggs, D-Milwaukee -- who was elected city treasurer in April 2012. So let’s return to the wildly partisan times of 2011 and see what role Coggs played in advancing Walker’s agenda. "Paid for" We Are Milwaukee Inc., which says it works for social and economic justice, registered with the state Government Accountability Board as a political committee in March 2012. Its registrant was Peter Rickman, who has been active in public demonstrations against Walker and as part of the Occupy Wall Street movement. The front of the We Are Milwaukee brochure against Coggs (which lists a return address in Wauwatosa) says: "We need leaders who will stand up to Scott Walker." The attack on Coggs, on the back, cites three 2011 votes. It says Coggs "voted with" Walker on one bill that the group says provides "millions of dollars in tax breaks to big corporations and the super-rich." It goes on to say Walker and his allies paid for for the tax breaks "by busting unions, cutting BadgerCare, and raising taxes on the poor and the middle class, thanks to Elizabeth Coggs’ help." Cited are Walker’s budget-repair bill and his 2011-2013 state budget bill. Rickman referred our questions to We Are Milwaukee spokesman Eric Hogensen, who argued that the tax breaks bill "opened the door" to cuts made in the budget-repair and budget bills because they created a "deficit." Hmmm. The budget deficit Walker faced exceeded $3 billion. Just how pivotal was the single tax breaks bill that We Are Milwaukee cited? Let’s examine the three bills, all of which became law and are footnoted in the flyer. 1. Tax breaks As we reported in analyzing a July 2012 claim made by state Rep. Kelda Helen Roys, D-Madison, against state Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Madison, in a congressional race, Assembly Bill 3 wipes away taxes for two years for businesses that move to Wisconsin. The state estimates the bill will mean $1 million over two years in lost revenue. Coggs voted for the bill, but so did many other Democrats. It was approved in the Assembly overwhelmingly, 82-12, in January 2011. So, Coggs did vote "with Walker" for a bill that could, over a period of years, create tax breaks amounting to millions of dollars. But her vote was hardly as decisive as the group portrays it. 2. Budget-repair bill After a 61-hour debate in February 2011, the GOP-controlled Assembly adopted the budget-repair bill in a chaotic fashion. The bill gave Walker broad powers to reshape health programs, use borrowing and make employees pay more for benefits to fill a $137 million hole in the two-year state budget ending June 30, 2011. As the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported: "Just after 1 a.m., Republicans cut off debate on Gov. Scott Walker's bill and in pell-mell fashion the body voted 51-17 to pass it. In the confusion, nearly one-third of the body -- 28 lawmakers including 25 Democrats, two Republicans and the body's lone independent -- did not vote on the bill at all." Coggs was among those who did not vote, Assembly records show. But the lack of her vote wasn't an important factor, given the margin the bill was approved by. And the $137 million deficit far exceeded the estimated loss of $1 million in revenue over two years from the tax breaks bill Coggs did vote for. Yet We Are Milwaukee says the $1 million paved the way for the $137 million -- and more. 3. Budget bill As for the two-year state budget, the Assembly passed it, 60-38, in June 2011. Records show Coggs voted no. The Walker-GOP budget cut spending on schools, local governments and public workers' benefits to meet the two-year shortfall -- which was more than $3 billion. Indeed, it would have taken more than 3,000 tax breaks at $1 million each to "pay for" the cuts. Our rating We Are Milwaukee said "millions of dollars in tax breaks" were paid for "by busting unions, cutting BadgerCare, and raising taxes on the poor and the middle class, thanks to Elizabeth Coggs' help." The idea that some $1 million in tax breaks over a two-year period supported by Coggs and most other Assembly Democrats needed to be paid for by some $3 billion in budget cuts is false and ridiculous.

pomt-09954	"You've heard endlessly about waterboarding. It happened to three terrorists."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/21/dick-cheney/dick-cheney-says-only-three-terror-suspects-were-e/	President Barack Obama and former Vice President Dick Cheney squared off in dueling speeches on national security on May 21, 2009. Not surprisingly, Cheney defended the controversial interrogation techniques used during the Bush administration on some terror suspects after the 9/11 attacks. And, he said, despite all the hand-wringing and public debate about waterboarding over the last couple years, the technique was used on only three detainees. "You've heard endlessly about waterboarding," Cheney said in his address at the American Enterprise Institute. "It happened to three terrorists. One of them was Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of 9/11, who has also boasted about his beheading of Daniel Pearl. "We had a lot of blind spots after the attacks on our country, things we didn't know about al-Qaida. We didn't know about al-Qaida's plans, but Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and a few others did know. "And with many thousands of innocent lives potentially in the balance, we did not think it made sense to let the terrorists answer questions in their own good time, if they answered them at all." Public records support his claim about the three detainees, who collectively were subjected to waterboarding at least 267 times. The use of waterboarding — an interrogation technique that simulates drowning — was first publicly acknowledged by then-CIA director Michael Hayden during a Senate intelligence hearing on Feb. 5, 2008. He said it was used on three terror suspects in 2002 and 2003. "Let me make it very clear and to state so officially in front of this committee that waterboarding has been used on only three detainees," Hayden said. "It was used on Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. It was used on Abu Zubaydah. And it was used on (Abd al-Rahim al-)Nashiri. The CIA has not used waterboarding for almost five years." According to a memo released by the Attorney General's Office in April 2009, waterboarding was removed from CIA’s authorized list of techniques sometime after 2005. Also in April 2009, the Justice Department released 2005 legal memos that detailed the use of the waterboarding technique in 2002 and 2003, including the revelation that it had been used 183 times against Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the self-described planner of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Cheney is correct that during a military tribunal in 2007, Mohammed claimed responsibility for the murder of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl in Pakistan in 2002. The memos also noted that the CIA used waterboarding at least 83 times in August 2002 against Abu Zubaydah, described by the CIA as one of Osama bin Laden's key lieutenants. And lastly, the technique was used on Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, the alleged mastermind of the 2000 USS Cole bombing. In all three cases, Hayden said, "We used it against these three high-value detainees because of the circumstances of the time. Very critical to those circumstances was the belief that additional catastrophic attacks against the homeland were imminent." There has been no information publicly released that any other terror suspects have been subjected to waterboarding. "We only know of those three being waterboarded," said Joanne Mariner, a counterterrorism expert with Human Rights Watch. "That's all that's on the public record." In short, Cheney is on solid ground with this statistic. We rate his statement True.	None	Dick Cheney	None	None	None	2009-05-21T19:04:20	2009-05-21	['None']
pomt-00452	Says Mike Braun has supported two proposals and a lawsuit to end coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/aug/20/joe-donnelly/mike-braun-end-coverage-pre-existing-conditions/	Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana is accusing his Republican challenger of flip-flopping on health care. "Mike Braun now says he’s for pre-existing conditions," Donnelly said in a video he posted to Twitter on Aug. 13. "There’s only one problem. Mike has said time, after time, after time, he’s against it." Donnelly said Braun has supported a House and Senate bill, as well as a lawsuit that "would have ended coverage for pre-existing conditions." Is that true? Braun indeed supported these actions, but Braun also maintains he supports coverage for pre-existing conditions. During a meeting with Republican Party activists in Indiana’s conservative Hamilton County on Aug. 7, Braun answered a question on whether insurance companies should cover pre-existing medical conditions. "Definitely; yes. Nobody should go broke because they get sick or have a bad accident," Braun said. Braun’s campaign repeated this talking point to us. "Mike Braun supports covering pre-existing conditions, and believes plans that work for Hoosiers will come from market-driven solutions, not more of what big government and the insurance industry force upon them," campaign spokesman Josh Kelley said. But health care experts told us that’s nearly impossible. "It is hard to make private competitive health insurance work for people with pre-existing conditions absent government intervention," said Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation. "That’s just the nature of risk spreading -- it doesn’t work without subsidies or a mandatory market." Braun’s campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment on how he could square opposing Obamacare yet supporting one of its central tenets. The House bill In August 2017, just after joining the race, Braun urged his two Republican primary opponents who are representatives in the U.S. House, Luke Messer and Todd Rokita, to sign a discharge petition that would force Congress to vote on an Obamacare repeal bill. "The people of Indiana want a full repeal of Obamacare and every Republican in Congress needs to sign the petition forcing leadership to bring this bill up for a vote," Braun wrote in a letter to the editor of the Kokomo Tribune on Aug. 16, 2017. "Congressman Messer and Rokita voted for the same legislation before, so why not do everything possible to get something done? … When I’m in the Senate, I’ll take action and keep pushing for the full repeal of Obamacare." The bill in question would have ended the most important Affordable Care Act subsidies: tax credits for premiums, cost-sharing subsidies, the individual mandate and Medicaid expansion. "So it would take away coverage for everybody, it’s not specific to whether you have a pre-existing condition, but by removing the subsidies, you would get a death spiral that would make coverage in the individual market unaffordable for everybody," Pollitz said. The Senate bill Braun similarly supported the Senate version of the bill. In several interviews, Braun criticized Donnelly for voting in favor of the Affordable Care Act and opposing repeal of the Affordable Care Act. "They want somebody that's going to be independent when they get to D.C. and I think that and attacking my business is when you've got a record that says you voted for Obamacare and then you were the deciding vote to repeal it," Braun said on the Ed Morrisey show on Aug. 14. "So, all of us as Republicans I think have a better message and we have the message of tax reform. I don't think Joe Donnelly had passed one piece of legislation in 12 years. He voted for Obamacare as a congressman, was the deciding vote against repealing it," Braun said during an IN Focus interview with Dan Spehler on July 22. "So, all of us as Republicans I think have a better message and we have the message of tax reform. You know, Joe Donnelly voted for Obamacare, you know back when he was a congressman and was a deciding vote against it (the GOP healthcare plan)," Braun said in an interview with Abdul Hakim-Shabbaz on July 23. There were several versions of the Senate bill depending on amendments. Regardless of which one we look at, Linda Blumberg, a health policy analyst at the Urban Institute, told us in June coverage for people with pre-existing conditions would have been more expensive and less accessible under the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017. The lawsuit On Feb. 26, 2018, 18 attorneys general and two governors challenged the Affordable Care Act as unlawful in a lawsuit filed in a U.S. district court in Texas. Braun told Politico reporter Burgess Everett he endorsed the lawsuit. That, too, would effectively end mandatory coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. "There would be much more damage beyond the issue of people with health problems being denied coverage, but that would in fact be one outcome," Blumberg told us. Our ruling Donnelly said Braun has supported two proposals and a lawsuit to end coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. His campaign referred us to Republican proposals in the Senate, House and a lawsuit to end the Affordable Health Care Act, which entails ending key provisions like mandatory coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. Braun’s campaign reaffirmed such positions, but argued for a non-Obamacare way to cover pre-existing conditions. We rate this statement Mostly True.

pomt-08971	"We don't get a lot of calls from this White House… I have, frankly, never had a call from them."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2010/jul/19/rick-perry/governor-rick-perry-says-hes-never-fielded-phone-c/	Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who seems to relish bashing Washington, suggested a complete lack of outreach by President Barack Obama and the White House in a Fox News Channel interview aired July 13. Speaking to anchor Neil Cavuto, Perry said: "We don’t get a lot of calls from this White House." Asked about his relations with the Democrat’s administration, the Republican governor said: "I have, frankly, never had a call from them." Perry’s remarks came after Cavuto asked the governor about federal plans to push afresh for a moratorium on the drilling of deep-water oil wells. According to a transcript posted online by Fox News, Cavuto said: "Did they consult on this? Did they consult you on this, sir, did anyone ..." Perry: "They don't..." Cavuto: "...run this, ‘Hey, we ought to give Rick Perry a call on this?’" Perry: "We don't get a lot of calls from this White House." Cavuto: "Really? How would you describe your relations with the Obama administration?" Perry: "You know, I have, frankly, never had a call from them. So they may have checked in at some staff levels that I'm not aware of." From "the standpoint of the White House caring what Texas thinks -- look... ," said Perry, ticking off some administration ideas he said would be injurious to Texas. "This is an administration that clearly has Texas on its radar and it’s in a bad way." We asked Perry’s office for elaboration on his no-call status with Obama and also contacted the White House, whose spokesman, Matt Lehrich, disputed Perry’s description. Lehrich pointed us to indications that Perry has been part of White House conference calls. On April 29, 2010, according to a press release on the White House website, the president called the governors of states on the Gulf of Mexico, including Perry, "to discuss the BP oil spill situation and assure the governors that the administration will continue to use every single available resource at our disposal in the response efforts." The release continues: "The president described the range of federal actions that are underway to respond to the spill and stressed the importance of maintaining close coordination with the governors as this event continues to evolve. All of the governors appreciated the call and the actions being taken by the federal government." An earlier release, from July 6, 2009, says Perry was among five governors to participate in a conference call with Vice President Joe Biden. Of late, Lehrich said in an e-mail, Perry has been invited to be on a call with senior administration officials involved in the response to the oil spill every day since May 4. Perry "has participated on a number of those calls and has been represented by his staff on many more," Lehrich said. We shared this information with Perry’s office and got no response. Next, we checked Perry’s state schedule covering April 1 to mid-July. There were no entries indicating White House calls April 29 or May 4. But Perry’s schedule for June 29 has an 8:15 a.m. entry stating "Phone Call: White House Intergovernmental Affairs/BP Oil Spill." Does the Democratic president routinely seek the Texas Republican’s counsel? We doubt it. But both the White House’s information and Perry’s own schedule contradict his claim he’s never had a call from this White House. Presuming his state schedule reflects what actually happened, Perry got such a call two weeks before the Fox interview aired. Pants on Fire!

pomt-01188	Says a man in Ferguson, Mo., was photographed holding a sign that said, "No mother should have to fear for her son's life every time he robs a store."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/dec/04/chain-email/viral-photo-ferguson-protester-doesnt-withstand-cl/	In the wake of several high-profile confrontations between white police officers and unarmed African-Americans recently, social media has become a major source of accusations, arguments -- and hoaxes. Recently, a reader sent us a photo that has been circulating on social media, showing an African-American protester standing in front of a fire station and holding up a hand-lettered sign that reads, "No mother should have to fear for her son's life every time he robs a store." The sign is an obvious reference to the death of Michael Brown, the black teenager who was shot and killed in Ferguson, Mo., in August 2014. Brown’s death became a focus for both peaceful protests and rioting in Ferguson, and it attracted attention around the nation and the world. On Nov. 25, a grand jury decided not to indict, setting off a new wave of demonstrations. The phrase "every time he robs a store" refers to surveillance footage showing Brown earlier that day robbing a store of cigarillos and assaulting a store employee. Supporters of Darren Wilson, the police officer who shot Brown, have said the robbery is an important piece of context in explaining Wilson’s shooting of Brown. Still, the PolitiFact reader asked us whether the photo was real or manufactured, so we decided to take a look. The version we received is cropped to focus on the African-American man holding the sign, with a partial view of a woman standing to his left. Other versions, such as one analyzed by Snopes.com, include a fuller view of the woman, holding a sign that says, "Shame on Ferguson Police," as well as another man, an African-American, holding a sign that says, "We the People." The starkly divergent messages of the three signs provide a clue that something is amiss. And indeed, something is amiss. In the original photograph -- published on the Riverfront Times’ news blog on Oct. 1 -- the sign read, "No mother should have to fear for her son's life every time he leaves home" (emphasis added). It also includes the hashtags #blacklivesmatter and #stayhuman. But words on the sign were doctored by a user of the social media site Imgur. Initially, the user posted this statement with the retouched photograph: "The black community has every reason to be angry with the police, and the brutality they inflict. But making a martyr out of the kid that robbed a store and attacked a police officer is just mind boggling. Micheal (sic) Brown is one of the worst things to happen to race relations in a long time." At some point after the doctored version of the image began circulating, the user acknowledged that he had changed the picture: "Edit: Yes, I shopped this. It captured mine, and many others, frustration with this whole situation." Our ruling A photograph that went viral purports to show a protester in Ferguson, holding a sign that said, "No mother should have to fear for her son's life every time he robs a store." However, the photo was manipulated by a social media user, who later acknowledged the alteration. The change in wording turns the sign’s message completely on its head, so we rate the claim Pants On Fire.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2014-12-04T17:01:38	2014-12-02	['Missouri']
pomt-10500	McCain's "plan for the economy is to extend George Bush's tax cuts for billionaires and give a $100-billion additional corporate tax cut."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/02/hillary-clinton/thats-not-the-whole-plan/	Speaking to union workers in Philadelphia, Sen. Hillary Clinton began "a blistering attack on the presumptive Republican nominee" concerning economic issues, according to the New York Times. "His plan for the economy is to extend George Bush's tax cuts for billionaires and give a $100-billion additional corporate tax cut," Clinton said. Blistering or not, Clinton's attack fairly recites some of McCain's economic proposals. It's worth noting, however that extending existing tax cuts and lowering the corporate income tax rate is not the entirety of McCain's plan for the economy. Among other things, McCain also proposes eliminating the alternative minimum tax, which was designed to make sure wealthy people paid a share of taxes but has become a problem in recent years for upper middle class families, too. Still, McCain's support for extending President Bush's tax cuts is well known. We checked it out not one , two , three , four , but five times because former candidate Mitt Romney and various political groups have harped on the fact that McCain originally opposed the Bush tax cuts before supporting them. McCain's camp could argue with the word "billionaires" because the Congressional Budget Office found the Bush tax cuts most benefited the top 1 percent of earners who had an average salary of $1.25-million. It goes without saying that billionaires are in the top 1 percent, too, but clearly most people in that tax bracket wouldn't fit that definition. But it's also clear they aren't hurting, financially, either. Clinton doesn't embellish at all when it comes to describing McCain's additional $100-billion corporate tax cut. She clearly is referring to his proposal to slice the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent, as McCain has outlined on his campaign Web site. McCain's chief economic aide, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former head of the Congressional Budget Office, told the Wall Street Journal it would cost $100-billion a year. McCain's campaign estimates the entirety of its tax cuts would total $400-billion a year. Clinton didn't mention that part, which causes us concern. Her statement suggests that McCain has only two ideas for helping the economy, and that's not true. Yes, she accurately describes those two elements of McCain's economic proposal, but she's wrong to suggest that's all McCain has in mind. For that, we give her a Half True.

pomt-14984	"I am very proud that over my almost 30 years of public service I have had no scandals."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2015/oct/14/lincoln-chafee/chafee-says-no-scandals-his-watch-s-true-ri-standa/	It was the grandest of stages for a former Warwick mayor turned U.S. senator, turned Rhode Island governor, turned presidential candidate. Rhode Island’s Lincoln Chafee was in a nationally televised debate Tuesday night with a chance to shine against just four rivals. Chafee set out to distinguish himself in his opening statement, making a number of claims we’ve heard before as well as this boast: "I’m very proud that over my almost 30 years of public service, I have had no scandals," Chafee said. No scandals? Nothing in almost three decades? A bold claim, especially for a Rhode Island politician. It’s true Chafee has never been charged, indicted, convicted or imprisoned. During those 30 years, one governor, the mayor of Providence and a gaggle of others have gone to prison. But scandal isn’t strictly a legal term. According to the dictionary, a scandal is a public disgrace. We kept that in mind as we reviewed Chafee’s 30 years of public service. One story jumped out at us. A controversy about the purchase of frogs — yes frogs for the mayor’s aquarium — as well as toboggans, theater tickets, flowers and other items totalling thousands of dollars a year. Chafee’s office bought the four frogs, which cost $1.99 each in 1997, and the rest of the stuff with taxpayers’ money from a discretionary account for the Warwick mayor’s office. The story blew up in 2000 as Chafee ran to keep his U.S. Senate seat. Chafee said other mayors had used the same account. But, he said, he was the first mayor to keep records on expenses. Unimpressed, Chafee’s critics charged he had inappropriately spent taxpayer money. One, mayoral candidate, Michael Woods, the 43-year-old brother of actor James Woods, called for a state police investigation. The Journal’s archives include two chapters in Chafee’s life that are more personal. For some politicians, college escapades involving cocaine or other narcotics, are fodder for scandal, especially when it’s something that’s concealed initially. Chafee’s experience with cocaine was still under wraps in the late ’90s and when the much anticipated questions finally came, he took pride in his transparent response. He immediately admitted his use of cocaine. And moved on with his career. As governor, there was another controversy surrounding the state’s handling of an underage drinking party thrown by Chafee’s 18-year-old son Caleb Chafee on the family’s Exeter property in 2012. The younger Chafee pleaded no contest to a criminal charge of violating the social host law; the state police never released the records on their investigation of the governor’s son. Some suggested that this raised questions about the possibility that there was something to hide. As governor, Chafee made an appointment in the final days of his administration that critics saw as a violation of the state’s revolving-door law. Chafee nominated a top aide and political ally, Richard Licht, for a state judgeship. The state ethics commission allowed the nomination, but critics argued the law should have been applied to Licht, the state’s director of administration. Finally, in the first six months of the Raimondo administration, revelations about the management of the Department of Transportation and the Department of Children, Youth and Families have raised questions about conduct in those departments under Chafee. Our ruling In his opening remarks Tuesday night Chafee said: "I’m very proud that over my almost 30 years of public service, I have had no scandals." We’re not entirely sure what Chafee considers a scandal. We reached out to Chafee’s spokeswoman to get the candidate’s definition, but she said she would need more time to respond. The dictionary again says a scandal is a public disgrace. Over the past 30 years, Chafee has had his share of controversy, and an occasional brush with scandal. But scandal, a full blown public disgrace? Probably not. After all, in the broader scheme of things, is it disgraceful to buy four frogs for $7.96 to amuse visitors to the mayor’s office? We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Lincoln Chafee	None	None	None	2015-10-14T20:00:00	2015-10-13	['None']
pomt-04530	Says Ronald Reagan "was behind in the polls in 1980 going into the debate with Jimmy Carter and then turned around 10 days later and won 40 states."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/oct/01/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-ronald-reagan-won-40-states-/	Mitt Romney may have hit a rough patch on the campaign trail, but Gov. Chris Christie recently suggested a winning debate performance this week could propel the Republican presidential candidate to victory in November. Just like the 1980 debate took Ronald Reagan from trailing in the polls to winning 40 states on Election Day, the governor said. The New Jersey governor offered that history lesson last week as Romney and President Barack Obama gear up for their first debate Wednesday. Obama has been leading Romney in most national polls. "Ask Ronald Reagan if he were around, you know, who was behind in the polls in 1980 going into the debate with Jimmy Carter and then turned around 10 days later and won 40 states," Christie, a Republican, said at a Sept. 24 news conference. "These debates matter. They’re very important." It’s true that Reagan won 44 states in the 1980 election, but it’s not entirely accurate for Christie to say Reagan "was behind in the polls" going into the debate with Carter. Leading up to that Oct. 28, 1980 debate -- a week before Election Day -- some polls showed Carter with a slight advantage over Reagan, but other polls had Reagan ahead of the president. Still, given the margins of error attached to the polls, the race appeared too close to call, according to various news articles. The governor’s office did not respond to two e-mails seeking comment. Let’s review some of those poll results. In a Gallup poll released the day before the debate, Carter was leading Reagan by three percentage points, 45 percent to 42 percent. That poll was based on a sample of 1,100 registered voters, including 800 likely voters. Another poll done for ABC News and released around the same time offered the exact opposite results: Reagan stood at 45 percent and Carter at 42 percent among likely voters. But news articles said that because of the margins of error for those two polls, the "race is essentially even" and a "virtual dead heat." An Associated Press-NBC News poll around the same time showed Reagan with a greater lead over Carter. Among likely voters, 42 percent supported Reagan and 36 percent backed Carter. That poll still had a margin of error of three percent. "Generally, comparable results from all these polls fall within the error margins of such surveys, meaning the race is really too close to call," the Associated Press wrote. The week before the debate, a CBS News/New York Times poll showed Carter leading Reagan, 43 percent to 41 percent among undecided voters. But given that poll’s sampling error, "Mr. Carter’s lead thus was highly uncertain, and it is quite possible that Mr. Reagan may actually be somewhat ahead," according to a New York Times article. Still, Reagan’s debate performance has been considered a deciding factor in his ultimate victory. "It is my contention that there was significant change in presidential preference by the public starting with the Carter/Reagan debate that accelerated through election day," Warren J. Mitofsky, a pollster for CBS News, later wrote. However, leading up to Election Day, polls failed to capture the scope of Reagan's landslide win. As Mitofsky noted, all of the major published polls "seriously understated" Reagan’s margin of victory over Carter. In terms of the popular vote, Reagan received about 51.6 percent, beating Carter’s roughly 41.7 percent. The 1980 presidential race also included Independent candidate John B. Anderson, who received about 6.7 percent of the popular vote. Our ruling At a news conference, Christie claimed Ronald Reagan "was behind in the polls in 1980 going into the debate with Jimmy Carter and then turned around 10 days later and won 40 states."

pomt-14096	Says 80 percent of North Carolinians support "the concept that men should not be in women’s restrooms, changing rooms, bathrooms, etc."	half-true	/north-carolina/statements/2016/may/14/tim-moore/nc-house-speaker-says-80-percent-think-bathrooms-s/	As the battle over who should be able to use what bathroom rages on in North Carolina and nationwide, opponents of transgender-friendly rules say public opinion is on their side. Tim Moore, the speaker of the N.C. House of Representatives, said it’s an overwhelming consensus. "The one thing where we’ve seen nearly unanimous – well, nothing’s unanimous – but 80 percent support out there is the concept that men should not be in women’s restrooms, changing rooms, bathrooms, et cetera – that that shouldn’t happen," Moore said in a May 5 discussion with reporters. We looked into polling on bathroom policy and found a wide range of results. Most don’t reach 80 percent, but clearly substantial numbers of people in North Carolina have told pollsters they oppose letting transgender people choose what bathroom to use. Polls have found safety concerns are also on some people’s minds. No one can say that there will never be any privacy or safety issues – of course there could be. But in a previous fact check, we looked for instances of sexual predators using the cover of transgender-friendly bathroom laws to dress up as the other sex and prey on people in bathrooms, the scenario many have said they’re concerned about. We found it Mostly True that such a scenario has never happened. We didn’t give it a True because there have been a few unproven allegations in the U.S. and one conviction in Canada. The Obama administration also hasn’t put stock in those concerns, and has said banning transgender people from the bathroom of the gender with which they identify is a civil rights violation. It was in that context, along with the administration’s threat to withhold federal funding from North Carolina, that Moore made his "nearly unanimous," "80 percent" claim. Uncertainty abounds We did find one poll from the conservative Raleigh-based Civitas Institute that was close to backing up Moore’s claim. We’re not sure if it’s the poll he was citing or if he was citing a poll at all – Moore didn’t respond to our questions – but we’ll proceed anyway. The poll asked: "Do you agree or disagree with a Virginia federal court ruling ordering girls and boys in public middle schools to share locker room, bathroom and shower facilities? The poll did find that 80 percent of people said they disagreed with the court ruling. However, we have several issues with the question. The question is not only leading and inflammatory but also fundamentally misconstrues what the court ruled. No boys and girls were ordered to shower, change or use the bathroom together. Instead, a federal appeals court ruled that a judge in Virginia had to reconsider a transgender boy’s request to use the boys’ facilities at school. The court also said the Obama administration acted legally in defining sex-based discrimination to include discrimination against transgender people. That’s the part that may have given rise to the poll question’s wording, since the student is likely to win now. Yet the Obama administration has repeatedly said that although schools should recognize transgender students’ rights, schools should also recognize other students’ right to privacy and that no student should be forced to openly share a changing area. In school districts around the country that have already recognized transgender students’ gender identities, officials have typically put private stalls in locker rooms and/or offered unisex one-person bathrooms. Given the issues with that question, let’s look at another. Another earlier poll from Civitas asked people a more accurate and nuanced question about transgender people in bathrooms, describing the arguments on both sides. This poll came before the state overturned Charlotte’s LGBT ordinance. "The Charlotte City Council passed a new bathroom ordinance for transgender people that allows biological men and biological women, who identify as the opposite sex, to use the bathroom or locker room of their choosing," the question stated, asking people to pick sides. Nearly 70 percent said they opposed the idea. Not 80 percent, but close. But what about polls from groups with less political bias? According to a joint poll from SurveyUSA in partnership with Time Warner Cable News, 51 percent of North Carolinians think transgender people should not be able to choose which bathroom to use. That’s not "nearly unanimous" like Moore said; it’s barely a majority. Another joint poll from SurveyUSA and a different TV station, WRAL, found 56 percent in agreement that transgender people shouldn’t be able to choose which bathroom to use – again, a majority, but not close to 80 percent. Our ruling A prominent conservative group, Civitas, did find 70 and 80 percent in two polls, although we had some serious doubts about the question that found the 80 percent support. Two polls from the less partisan SurveyUSA in partnership with local TV stations have found 56 percent and 51 percent of North Carolinians support the idea. That’s still a majority, but it’s certainly not the "nearly unanimous," "80 percent support" that Moore claimed. We rate this claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/49f0e634-7574-479d-ae14-5c89d8dee47e	None	Tim Moore	None	None	None	2016-05-14T18:30:21	2016-05-05	['North_Carolina']
pomt-08593	"Under Gov. Kitzhaber, unemployment rose 65 percent, state spending went up 57 percent and personal incomes declined compared to the rest of the country."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2010/sep/24/chris-dudley/chris-dudley-says-oregons-economy-tanked-john-kitz/	Chris Dudley, the Republican running for governor, wants to make sure Oregonians remember how bad things were back in the day -- that is, when his Democratic opponent, John Kitzhaber, was running the state. At every opportunity, Dudley notes the damage done in the early 2000s by a faltering economy and the end of high-tech’s rapid expansion in Oregon. That was when then-Gov. Kitzhaber was nearing the end of a second term marked by steep job losses and bitter fights with Republicans over state budget cuts. "Under Gov. Kitzhaber," Dudley said in a recent speech in Albany, "unemployment rose 65 percent, state spending went up 57 percent and personal incomes declined compared to the rest of the country." We wondered about two things: Was it really that bad? And how much can you blame Kitzhaber for what happened? So let’s take a look, first at the unemployment number. In 1995, when Kitzhaber took office, Oregon’s economy was streaking at a record pace and unemployment was as low as it had ever been, 4.7 percent. The rate hovered around 5 percent for most of his career as governor because the economy remained healthy. But joblessness began to spike upward in his final two years as the national and state economies went into a deep recession. National unemployment figures followed a similar trend, although remained about a percentage point below Oregon’s. When Kitzhaber left office, Oregon’s unemployment rate stood at 7.8 percent. So Dudley’s correct: at the end of Kitzhaber’s tenure, the unemployment rate was up 65 percent. What about that state spending figure? That’s a little trickier. The hot economy in the 1990s produced record-setting tax revenues for the state. Total state spending, which includes federal pass-through money, such as Medicaid and food stamp payments, indeed increased by 56 percent over Kitzhaber’s eight years, rising from $22.6 billion to $35.3 billion. General fund spending, however, rose by a more staid 26 percent -- from $8.2 billion to $10.3 billion -- and that’s widely considered the more accurate measure of state spending fluctuations. (Oregon's population grew 11 percent between 1995 and 2003. Inflation between those two years was 28 percent.) Worth noting: Republicans controlled the Legislature throughout Kitzhaber’s tenure, and approved all general fund spending increases. Last, we checked on personal income. The dot-com boom benefited not just Oregon but the rest of the nation, too. Even though Oregonians were making more money, they weren’t keeping up, and per-capita income rates fell slightly in relation to other states. In 1995, Oregon’s per capita income stood at 97 percent of the nation’s, when Kitzhaber left office it had dropped to 95 percent. So Dudley’s math mostly holds up. But is it accurate to attribute those numbers to Kitzhaber’s leadership? We checked with state economist Tom Potiowsky, who monitors the ups and downs of Oregon’s financial health. He said Oregon’s economy, which is based heavily in manufacturing, is at the mercy of national and global economic factors. When home building goes down, Oregon’s lumber products aren’t needed. When computer sales are down, Oregon’s chips go unsold, he said. "Those were very much national economic factors, really pushing us around," during Kitzhaber’s final years, Potiowsky said. University of Oregon economist Tim Duy had a similar take. What happened at the end of Kitzhaber’s administration was caused by the national business cycle and was largely out of his control. Yet Oregon didn’t help itself much, notes Duy and John Tapogna, president of ECONorthwest, a Portland economic consulting firm. When high-tech firms were expanding, the state -- and Kitzhaber’s office -- wasn’t exactly helping them navigate the state’s strict land use rules. So is Dudley right to hang Oregon’s economic decline around Kitzhaber’s neck? -- His statement is factually accurate on unemployment, spending growth and the decline in per capita income relative to the rest of the nation during Kitzhaber’s term. -- Oregon, however, was knocked for a loop by the same dot-com bust that sent the nation’s economy into a tailspin. Realistically, there’s not much a governor can do about those kind of macroeconomic factors. -- Oregon enjoyed a robust economy for six of the eight years Kitzhaber was governor. But when things started to go south, Kitzhaber was at the helm. We find the claim to be Half True. Comment on this item.	None	Chris Dudley	None	None	None	2010-09-24T11:41:02	2010-09-15	['None']
pomt-13735	California has "the sixth largest economy on planet Earth."	mostly true	/california/statements/2016/jul/26/kevin-de-leon/does-california-really-have-sixth-largest-economy-/	State Senate leader Kevin de León spotlighted California’s economic and social achievements during his speech this week at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. The Democrat from Los Angeles touted the state’s newly established $15 per hour minimum wage, efforts to keep college affordable and California’s hundreds of thousands of clean energy jobs. "We’ve made unprecedented progress in every area," De León told a cheering crowd. "And when we elect Hillary Clinton as our next president, I know that our progress will be America’s progress." The state senator then repeated a talking point California leaders love to make on national and international stages, about the size of the state’s economy: "These are the progressive policies that have made California the sixth largest economy on planet Earth," De León said. We won’t wade into the debate over whether progressive or other policies have positioned the state’s economy on such a high perch. But we will examine the provocative "sixth largest economy on planet Earth" claim by itself. State Senate leader Kevin de León makes the "sixth largest economy" claim at the 1:45 minute mark in this video. Our research State leaders have made this hypothetical comparison for years, examining California’s gross domestic product against nations across the globe. With nearly 40 million people, the state has a larger population than many countries. It also boasts a diverse set of industries from technology to tourism and entertainment. In June, Gov. Jerry Brown’s administration released figures showing California, with a GDP of more than $2.4 trillion in 2015 had jumped two spots in these unique world rankings ahead of France and Brazil and into sixth place behind the United Kingdom. First on the list is the United States, followed by China, Japan and Germany. California’s place on the list has fluctuated over time. It had been 10th as recently as 2012 due to the effects of the financial and housing slumps. The rankings use International Monetary Fund data. California is the only state on the list of nations. Experts have said California’s rise in the rankings reflects its strong economic growth compared with the rest of the world. They have cited Silicon Valley’s continued tech boom as a critical factor. "It speaks to California doing relatively well in a sluggish global economy," Jeff Michael, director of the University of the Pacific’s Center for Business and Policy Research, told the Sacramento Bee in June. A more complex picture De León’s statement, made in a short 4-minute speech, did not include much context. When adjusting for the state’s high cost of living, California’s GDP ranking drops to 11th in the world, according to the California Legislative Analyst’s Office. A tweet on June 14, 2016 from the California's nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office. Carson Bruno, who studies California policy at the conservative Hoover Institution, says there’s a lot missing from the "sixth largest economy claim." In California, "housing costs more; electricity and gas cost more; and even most goods and services cost more than the national average," he wrote in a post on RealClearMarkets.com. "In many respects California's cost of living is much more like a Western European nation than it is like the rest of the U.S. The widely reported global rankings ignore this reality." De León’s spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. Our rating State Senate leader Kevin de León recently claimed at the Democratic National Convention that California has "the sixth largest economy on planet Earth." This hypothetical comparison rests on California’s $2.4 trillion GDP, which moved slightly above that of France and Brazil in 2015 to sixth in the world. The ranking, and De León’s statement, however, ignore California’s sky high cost of living and Silicon Valley’s role in the state’s economic growth. The state’s GDP drops several places when adjusted for cost of living. De León’s statement, while accurate, could have used this additional information or clarification.

pomt-07762	Gov. Rick Scott's sale of the state planes was "not proper."	true	/florida/statements/2011/feb/24/jd-alexander/gov-rick-scott-and-senate-budget-chief-spat-over-s/	Florida Gov. Rick Scott is at loggerheads with powerful Senate budget chief J.D. Alexander over whether Scott was allowed to sell the two state airplanes. The decision fulfilled a campaign promise, but Alexander believes the sale was "not proper" because it needed approval of the Legislature. Citing statutes and the Florida Constitution, the Lake Wales Republican made his case in a trio of letters to Scott starting on Feb. 17, 2011. The governor, Alexander wrote, failed to respect "the Legislature's constitutional duty to appropriate funds and your duty to spend appropriated funds in accordance with the law." Scott countered in a pair of statements to the press that he did nothing wrong. PolitiFact Florida wanted to step in here and try to referee the disagreement between these two top Republicans. The background: On Feb. 11, Scott announced the sale of the state's two airplanes -- a 2000 King Air 350 and a 2003 Cessna Citation Bravo jet. The King Air fetched $1.77 million, while the jet sold for $1.9 million; $3.67 million all together. Most of the proceeds actually went to pay off the $3.4 million the state still owed on the Cessna. The money went from the buyers directly to the bank the state owed the money. What remained was deposited into the Aircraft Trust Fund -- $84,072.13 was deposited on Feb. 14, and $176,500 was deposited on Feb. 17, according to Alexis Lambert, spokeswoman for Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater. Scott said the money budgeted for the aircraft program would also be returned to the general revenue fund, saving about $556,000 this current budget year, and $2.4 million in future years. Alexander's problem Alexander, for the record, doesn't oppose the sale. Just how it happened. On the merits of this particular case, his debate with Scott is somewhat academic. The planes already have been sold and are gone, and Alexander is willing to retroactively approve the arrangement. But the disagreement could have broader implications that result in shifting previously sacrosanct budget powers away from the Legislature and to the executive branch. The roles of the branches of government generally have been well defined. The Legislature passes the budget every year, and the governor carries out the budget as passed (after having the opportunity to veto parts of the budget, or the entire budget). Alexander's contention is that Scott's sale of the two airplanes violates that balance. He believes that: Scott unilaterally overrode the current 2010-11 state budget law by effectively eliminating the $2.4 million budget line item to operate the two state planes; That Scott does not have the authority to spend state funds on his own to pay off the balance due on the Cessna jet. The money to pay off the lease was generated from the revenues created by selling both planes; And that Scott may have erred by not placing the proceeds of the sales into the treasury. Most of the money went from the buyers to the bank that held the lease on the state jet. What would stop Scott from not spending money on Medicaid, then? Or from selling other state property to finance deeper tax cuts? "The Constitution doesn't allow executive agencies to embargo appropriated funds," Alexander said. "When money is appropriated, there is an obligation to spend it." He recently made a similar claim when discussing Scott's decision to reject federal funding for high-speed rail. Alexander said that the state already had budgeted money for the project and that Scott couldn't just pull out without legislative approval. PolitiFact Florida found Alexander's claim in that case to be accurate, but noted that Scott held most of the cards to kill the rail line anyway. We found the claim, overall, to be Half True. When it comes to the state planes, Scott is prohibited by statute from impounding state money, which is defined by statute as "the omission of any appropriation or part of an appropriation in the approved operating plan." Put another way, Scott cannot simply stop or ignore budget appropriations that are law except when necessary to avoid a deficit. The governor also is prohibited from taking money from the state treasury unless appropriated by law. Buying out the lease may constitute a violation because the payment wasn't authorized by the Legislature. However, the money went straight from the companies that bought the planes to the bank the state owed $3.4 million to, to pay off the Cessna. In that case, there also are specific regulations regarding the selling of state property, and the money received from those sales. According to statutes, money received from the sale of state property must be retained by the custodian and may be disbursed for the acquisition of exchange and surplus property and for all necessary operating expenditures. The custodian shall maintain records of the accounts into which the money is deposited. In this case, the custodian of the plane is the Department of Management Services, which is under the governor's direction. The other side We asked the governor's office to cite statutes supporting Scott's decision to sell the plane without legislative input, and we asked to speak to the general counsel or any person who advised Scott that the sale complied with Florida law. We did not hear back. Interim general counsel Rick Figlio did respond to Alexander on Feb. 24. Figlio said he advised Scott that it was legal to sell the state planes "subject to the condition that the purchaser clear outstanding debt." He then asked Alexander to provide specific statutes restricting the disposal of state property in the way Scott sold the state planes. "If any such restrictions exist, I would appreciate your counsel directing me to them as they will assist this office in advising the Governor regarding the scope of his powers as they relate to future transaction," Figlio wrote to Scott. An outside opinion We asked Bruce R. Jacob, dean emeritus and professor of law at Stetson University, to sort through the back-and-forth. In short, he sides with Alexander. Jacob said it appears that Scott failed to comply with state statutes prohibiting him from withholding appropriated funds. The key, in this case, is that Scott never adequately went through a process to determine that there was a budget deficit, which could have given him cover for selling the planes. Scott would have needed to consult with the state's Revenue Estimating Conference -- a legislative body -- and certified that a deficit will occur in the general revenue fund. "What Alexander is complaining about is that, under this section, where the Legislature has appropriated money for the expense of the planes, the governor is required to spend that money," Jacob said. "I am sure the governor from time to time does not spend money that the Legislature has appropriated for a particular purpose, and I doubt that anyone gets upset about it. "However, the main point, it seems to me, is that if the governor was thinking of doing this, he needed to consult with the leadership of the Legislature," he said. "Common courtesy called for such consultation. The governor and the Legislature have to work together. The governor should not be allowed to 'go it on his own,' so to speak, in a situation such as this." Jacob also says Alexander has a "point" by claiming that the amount owed on the Cessna should have been appropriated by the Legislature and paid from the state treasury. "Money of the state should not be spent unless it is for an authorized purpose and complete records should be kept so that anyone in the state can see what was spent and for what purpose. In this case it seems to me that the governor short-circuited the process," Jacob said. Senate President Mike Haridopolos, R-Merritt Island, said Scott's intention wasn't to be deceptive. "This is his first month on the job. If he made a mistake, he'll fix it," Haridopolos said. "His intent was the correct intent. I don't think he meant any malice by it ... no one thinks the governor tried to pull a fast one." Our ruling The majority of the evidence and a legal expert side with Alexander in this argument about the sale of the state's two airplanes. Alexander said the sales were "not proper," and cited specific state statutes. Most germane is a statute that requires the governor to spend the money allocated for a specific purpose in the state budget. The governor's office offered no rebuttal, and as such, we see no evidence that Alexander's wrong. We rate his claim True.	None	J.D. Alexander	None	None	None	2011-02-24T17:47:10	2011-02-23	['None']
pomt-14280	"We got a million jobs."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2016/apr/06/rick-scott/rick-scott-correct-florida-created-1-million-jobs-/	During his confrontation with an unhappy constituent at a Gainesville Starbucks, Florida Gov. Rick Scott heard an earful. But he also dished some out. At one point in the now-viral exchange, Scott responded to the barrage of criticism by customer Cara Jennings with what appears to be an estimate of the jobs created on his watch. "We got a million jobs," Scott said. Jennings wasn’t satisfied -- she ripped Scott by responding, "A million jobs? Great. Who here has a great job or is looking forward to finishing school? Do you really feel like you have a job coming up?" Whoever you think won this face-off, we wondered whether Scott was right that Florida "got a million jobs" on his watch. So we took a closer look. As we always do when faced with this type of question, we turned to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which tracks job data on the federal, state and local level. Since Scott’s brief riposte didn’t specify what type of jobs Scott was talking about, we will assume he was referring to total non-farm employment -- the bureau’s most basic measurement -- rather than private-sector employment, which is a different, narrower category that Scott often refers to. Scott began his tenure in January 2011, so for the full comparison, we can contrast the most recent employment level in the state to the level in either December 2010 or January 2011. As it turns out, both produce the 1 million in gains that Scott referred to. Between December 2010 and February 2016, total nonfarm employment in Florida rose by 1,041,400. And between January 2011 and February 2016, it rose by 1,028,100. (These are net jobs gained, which is the standard measurement economists use.) So Scott’s boast that Florida "got a million jobs" is well supported. That said, we’ll note one caveat that we always raise when analyzing claims such as Scott’s: It’s a stretch for the governor (or the president, or a mayor) to claim credit for such gains. Governors do have an impact on their state’s economy. They can push an agenda of taxing and spending that may help the economy, though the actual impact of such policies on economic growth is always somewhat speculative, since you can’t run an independent experiment with an economy governed by the opposite policies. But even if governors do deserve some credit for how the economy performs on their watch, there are other things over which they have no control that can have impacts that are at least as big, if not bigger. These include changes in technology, fluctuations in the national and international economy, demographic shifts (the Census Bureau estimates the state’s population has increased by about 1.46 million people since April 2010, for instance), and events like natural disasters. Indeed, governors -- like presidents -- tend to get too much credit when things are going well, and too much blame when things are going poorly. "Presidents, governors, and mayors can have an impact on job creation during their terms in office," Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless has told PolitiFact previously. "Almost always, however, the impact is small in relation to the effects of events and trends over which elected officials have little control, especially in their first few years on the job. A recession that is underway or begins soon after a president or governor takes office is in no way the fault of the new officeholder. The flip side is that chief executives cannot claim much credit for a strong economic recovery that begins shortly before or after they take the oath of office. The conditions that made the recovery possible were already present when their term in office began. The executive’s policies may have speeded or slowed the recovery around the margins, but the conditions that caused the recovery to begin were already present before the oath of office was administered." This critique is especially relevant in Scott’s case. Scott took office not long after a severe recession bottomed out. It was no shock that whoever was elected governor in 2010 would benefit from some degree of job growth, since the worst of the recession would be behind them, and the economy tends to run in cycles. As we have previously noted, Scott said the "7-7-7 Plan" he ran on in 2010 would create 700,000 jobs on top of the 1 million jobs state economists predicted Florida would add by 2017 no matter what policies came out of Tallahassee. He later denied saying that, but in tracking Scott’s campaign promises, PolitiFact Florida continues to hold him to his pledge to create 1.7 million jobs. (That promise is currently rated In the Works.) In other words, Scott should be pleased that 1-million-plus jobs were created on his watch, but he ought to be humble about how much of a role he played in making it happen. Our ruling Scott said "we got a million jobs," referring to employment in the state of Florida on his watch. On the numbers, Scott is on target -- the figure is actually a bit higher than 1 million net, new, nonfarm jobs. We’ll just note, as we always do in cases like this, that the governor is not solely responsible for this improvement -- other factors played a role too. The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2016-04-06T16:00:48	2016-04-05	['None']
pomt-07919	Regulations on developers have thwarted construction on county-owned land in Milwaukee’s downtown Park East corridor.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jan/31/jeff-stone/milwaukee-county-executive-candidate-jeff-stone-sa/	Seven years after the former Park East freeway spur came down on the north edge of Milwaukee’s downtown, a move aimed at spurring development, some buildings have risen nearby -- but not on Milwaukee’s County’s prime portion of the land. Why? At a Jan. 21, 2011 forum sponsored by the Milwaukee Press Club and Marquette University Law School, the five candidates in the special election for Milwaukee County executive were asked to assign blame for the eyesore. They pointed to the bad economy, the financial crisis, excessive bureaucracy and mismanagement by former county executive and current Gov. Scott Walker – or a combination of those factors. All, that is, but state Rep. Jeff Stone, R-Greendale. Stone, by his own account, helped make the freeway demolition possible as a state lawmaker. He squarely -- and solely -- blamed county rules that favor developers who pay union-scale wages and hire local residents. He was referring to the so-called "community benefits" policy approved in 2005 as part of the Park East Redevelopment Compact. It was backed by labor, religious and environmental groups over the objection of Walker, who said it would hinder development. Said Stone: "What we’ve seen in the county is that we pile on requirements above and beyond what the market requires or will allow, and so the property sits there, unused, underutilized, wasting an opportunity for our taxpayers, for people that want to get jobs..." Is he right? The requirements are to blame? Asked to support his claim, Stone said the requirements generate extra costs during construction and for ongoing management, and force higher rents that can turn off prospective tenants. In a statement, Stone offered this solution: "The county should consider removing the restrictions placed on county-owned land, and either (sell) the land to the City of Milwaukee or come up with some creative partnership with the city to minimize the obstacles to development." The evidence Stone provided essentially was his opinion. It did not include any example to show the benefits were the sole -- or even primary -- cause of the lack of development on county land, while adjacent city-owned land has been developed. We turned to county and city development officials, developers and elected officials for their perspective on the contrast between the city- and county-owned land. Rocky Marcoux, the city’s development chief, said the wage and hiring rules play no role in discouraging development in the Park East. In 2009, the city approved rules similar to those the county put in place in 2005 -- and has still managed to attract major housing and hotel developments on its share of the Park East corridor. Marcoux blamed the county’s failure on its inexperience on real-estate deals and a failure to coordinate efforts with the city. One example he cites: The county put large parcels up for sale -- entire blocks -- discouraging interest by small developers. A prominent official with one of the state’s largest commercial real estate brokerage firms had a different take. Jim Barry III, president of Cassidy Turley Barry, said he does not think there is one particular reason for the lack of progress, which he calls "shameful." But he thinks the two biggest factors are the wage-and-hiring standards -- they stigmatized the land, in his view -- and an "elephantine" approval process requiring developers to get both city and county OK for projects on the county-owned land. He said the city’s rejection of a special financing district for one proposed development on county land killed the project. The developer of the proposed Palomar Hotel and condos wanted $18 million in city financing assistance for the $158 million project — a request city officials rejected. Dallas-based Gatehouse Capital Corp. said it needed more city cash because of tight credit markets and weak demand for downtown condos. The developers did not cite the wage-and-hiring rules as a concern. One of the main movers behind the wage and hiring standards, Kathleen Mulligan-Hansel, a co-founder of the Good Jobs & Livable Neighborhoods coalition, says there have been unrealistic expectations on how quickly the Park East would redevelop. She said the nationwide housing crash caused retrenchment in downtown development across the county. Marcoux made a similar point. Milwaukee is one of dozens of cities to adopt the approach. Mulligan-Hansel, has heard the criticism that community benefits might have been just enough to squelch development in a city as small as Milwaukee. But she pointed out Pittsburgh adopted the approach as well and has been successful. The idea, said Mulligan-Hansel, is that when public lands are developed, a chunk of the developer’s profits should be redistributed to the public in the form of wages and jobs, thus helping to relieve poverty. Supervisor Theodore Lipscomb, chairman of the county’s Economic Development Committee, said developers who have made offers to purchase county land have blamed financing problems and lack of demand for the failure to complete deals -- not the wage and hiring rules. Many big developers already pay prevailing wage scale, and don’t see the rule as a problem, Lipscomb said. Despite his declarative statement at the candidate forum, Stone seems to agree in part with a couple of the factors cited by the experts and insiders we contacted. He told PolitiFact Wisconsin the financial markets have "not been conducive to new development" and city-county approval processes were a "daunting hurdle." But he noted the financing crunch was not until late 2009, five years after demolition of the Park East freeway spur. Let’s top this item off. At a candidate forum, Stone cited community benefits rules as the reason why gulls -- not graders -- populate the county-owned Park East land. But, as city development officials note, similar requirements are in place for city-owned parcels, where progress has been made. What’s more, even one of the toughest critics of the rules did not contend they are the sole problem, and Stone himself later reframed his position to recognize those factors. We rate Stone’s statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-10844	"In every single country, she had a majority of the vote -- or more of those who'd already made up their minds."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/10/hillary-clinton/hillary-is-famous-in-europe/	Former President Bill Clinton seized on a poll by a Canadian firm, Angus Reid Strategies, showing that more than 40 percent of people in France and Germany, and more than 30 percent in Canada, Britain and Italy support Sen. Hillary Clinton's candidacy for president. He said it "shows you what people around the world think of her." The former president has his numbers right, but he's overreaching by saying this indicates strong international support. "I think what that's telling us is that the poll is measuring, in some ways, name identification," said Karlyn Bowman, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who analyzes public opinion. "Hillary is known by virtually everyone in the U.S. and pretty well known abroad." Carl Sferrazza Anthony, the author of several books on first ladies and the consulting historian for the National First Ladies Library in Canton, Ohio, declared Clinton "the most traveled First Lady in history." While many of her trips were virtually ignored by the U.S. media, the international press covered them heavily, and she earned kudos abroad for her support of micro loans, women's rights, healthcare, democracy and other issues, Anthony said. Still, roughly four in 10 of those polled by Angus Reid were undecided about who they'd prefer to inhabit the White House, said Mario Canseco of Angus Reid. "At this early stage of the campaign, the media in Europe is not yet paying attention to the U.S. presidential race," he said.

pomt-03581	"The Affordable Care Act is bringing the cost of health care in our country down."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/may/16/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-says-obamacare-bringing-down-health-c/	House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi says Democrats care about frugality — and the president’s health care law is one example. It’s bringing down the cost of health care, she told MSNBC host Chris Hayes. While key elements of the Affordable Care Act don’t go into effect until 2014, we wondered if the law has already brought down the cost of care. It depends partly on what you mean by "down." Growth rate Hayes and Pelosi chatted May 13, 2013, about Republicans’ focus on reducing the deficit. "It strikes me that they have been remarkably successful in doing that," Hayes said. "When you look at the debt ceiling debacle that led to the Budget Control Act, which has now led to the sequester, that actually …" Pelosi interrupted. "Oh, please, thank you for this question. This is so far off the course. "First of all, the actions taken by President Obama and the House Democratic Congress, House and Senate, when he became president was the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. "Many of the initiatives that he passed are what are coming to bear now, including the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act is bringing the cost of health care in our country down in both the public and private sector. "And that is what is largely responsible for the deficit coming down." We asked Pelosi’s office for evidence that the Affordable Care Act "is bringing the cost of health care in our country down." She meant that the law has reduced the speed of growth in health care costs — not that they’re actually lower than before, a spokesperson said. "Down does not mean below zero," said spokesperson Drew Hammill. "It means below recent projections and compared to historical trends." U.S. health care spending has grown at historically low levels, just 3.9 percent a year in 2011 and 2010. But it was also at 3.9 percent in 2009, before the law passed. "Health care costs have not been going down. They have been rising more slowly," said Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute who’s a vocal critic of the law. What’s behind the change? There's controversy among health care economists over just why that slowdown's happening, whether it'll continue, and what role the law may play. The recent slowdown actually began in 2003, noted Jessica Stone, a policy analyst for budget-hawk group Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, and continued to fall as the economy weakened. But four recent studies agree that there’s more at work than just the economy. Does the Affordable Care Act play a role? It might. "They all agree that the unexplained part is large, making the ACA one likely explanation," said David Cutler, a Harvard economist who advised Obama during the 2008 campaign. His study, published in the May issue of Health Affairs, says the 2007-09 recession accounted for 37 percent of the slowdown. Eight percent he attributes to a decline in private insurance coverage and cuts to some Medicare payments. That leaves 55 percent of the slowdown "unexplained." He points to a few ways the Affordable Care Act is involved, including a reduction in Medicare Advantage payments and greater efficiency from health care providers — such as a reduction in hospital-acquired infections and readmissions, which he says are directly related to payment incentives in the health care law. "So, the ACA is a big deal in this — not the only factor, to be sure, but one important factor," he said. A second analysis, by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Altarum Institute, found a much larger role for broader changes in the economy: 77 percent. Structural changes in the health care system "may be playing a modest role." And, it noted, changes yet to come under the Affordable Care Act could also affect such trends "significantly." Savings in Medicare and creation of health insurance exchanges could curb growth. Meanwhile, spending might bump upward as people who were previously uninsured get covered next year. (Indeed, the Medicare actuary assumed back in 2009 that increasing the number of folks who are insured would for a time outweigh the law’s downward impact on growth rates.) But that will likely happen around the same time as the economy strengthens, which may raise health care spending on its own. So once again, it’ll take closer study to tease out the role of changes under the law. "We will only know a couple of years after robust economic growth is occurring and the current round of innovation has had some time to play itself out," said Gail Wilensky, a health care analyst who ran the Medicare program under President George H.W. Bush. "Everything until then is reading tea leaves — frequently through a biased filter." Our ruling Pelosi said "the Affordable Care Act is bringing the cost of health care in our country down." But it’s the rate of growth that’s dropped, not the actual cost of care — which is still rising. Meanwhile, recent studies agree that something more than just the recent recession has driven that lower growth rate. Some experts argue that includes provisions of the health care law, such as lower Medicare Advantage payments and incentives for greater efficiency from hospitals. Others say it's simply too soon to say. Spending may increase as more people become insured, but for now, there's divided support for Pelosi's statement. We rate it Half True.

pomt-03738	Says the 2010-11 New Hampshire budget ended with an $18 million surplus, while the Republican-led 2012-13 budget has a $40 million deficit.	mostly true	/new-hampshire/statements/2013/apr/11/new-hampshire-democratic-party/nh-democrats-say-they-left-state-budget-surplus-an/	Just like baseball, New Hampshire's budget season is just getting under way. But even before legislators got their first swing at this year’s spending proposal, political leaders were already checking the score. N.H. Democratic Party leaders took aim at the current 2012-13 budget on Twitter last month. They contrasted the Republican-led spending plan, crafted two years ago by Senate Majority Leader Jeb Bradley and former House Speaker William O’Brien, with the 2010-11 budget, passed by Democratic Gov. John Lynch and Senate President Maggie Hassan, the current governor. "NH FACT: Lynch/Hassan 2010/11 budget ended in $18m surplus," Democratic chairman Ray Buckley tweeted Friday, March 29th. "OBrien/Bradley 2012/13 budget has $40m deficit." With nearly three months left in the 2013 Fiscal Year, the budget projections are constantly on the move. But, the 2010-11 figures have been set for a while. So, we decided to go back and check the record books. To start, we approached Democratic Party officers, who pointed to a PolitiFact check we conducted back in August looking into the 2010-11 budget. At the time, we checked a claim by the New Boston Republican Committee, that suggested Democrats had built up a deficit of $1 billion in Fiscal Year 2010-11. As we noted then, the $1 billion figure came from a report released in January 2011 by the Legislative Budget Assistant, a nonpartisan office that reviews the state spending plans. The report, intended as a point-in-time projection rather than a final budget tally, identified $845 million in spending that could have posed concerns for the new legislature if all fiscal policies remained the same. "I was talking about appropriations that would go up by virtue of formula driven things," Jeff Pattison, the budget assistant, said at the time. "Things that would happen if nothing was done about them." But, state legislators, required by law to balance the budget, made the necessary adjustments, and by the end of the year, they had built a $17.7 million surplus, according to the state’s annual report. Some political leaders argued at the time the numbers were skewed because lawmakers relied heavily on borrowing (more than $130 million, according to some reports) and on one-time federal funds ($80 million-plus) to balance the budget, leaving a "structural deficit" heading into the next budget cycle. That year, Lynch, Hassan and other Democratic leaders removed the State Liquor Commission off state spending books by putting its $90 million budget in an independent enterprise account, and they saved another $90 million by issuing state-backed bonds rather than paying cash to cover school construction costs. Still, others maintained the surplus came through a range of budget cuts and tax hikes common to the budget cycle. They cut more than $233 million, laying off nearly 200 state workers, closing some programs and making the university system return $25 million in state aid, among other actions. Either way, the $17.7 million surplus officially left from the 2010-11 budget roughly matches the Democratic Party’s $18 million claim. So, Buckley is on target on the first part of his claim. Now, on to the 2012-13 budget. To support their $40 million deficit claim, Democratic Party officers directed us toward a Fiscal Year 2013 snapshot, released last month by the budget assistant’s office. As Buckley suggested, the worksheet, released March 12, did report a $40.7 million revenue shortfall, most of which comes from shortages in Medicaid Expansion Tax revenues ($36.8 million). But, like the 2011 report, Pattison, the budget assistant, intended this release only as a point-in-time projection to give legislators an idea of what could happen in the months to follow. The projections change frequently, Pattison said. "I’m not saying it changes on a daily basis, but it can change fairly quickly," he warned last week. By the end of March, the projections had changed course. According to a monthly revenue report released Tuesday, April 2, by the Department of Administrative Services, state officials closed March with revenues up $26.6 million over the initial budget projections. If those numbers stand, that would leave the 2012-13 budget facing a $14 million deficit, and further revenues could level the spending by the end of the fiscal year, said Linda Hodgdon, commissioner of the administrative services department, who authored the March report. "We're hopeful that because March was such a good month, April will also be a good month," Hodgdon said. "If we have another good month, it could potentially close the gap. That’s what I’m hoping." Our Ruling Buckley and the Democratic Party are right on with their claim about the 2010-11 budget. That year, lawmakers closed the spending plan with an $18 million surplus. And, though the numbers change constantly, Buckley, the Democratic chairman, is on target regarding the 2012-13 spending plan, as well. Or he was at the time, anyway. Recent reports show the projections have changed, as they will continue to do throughout the rest of the fiscal year, But those numbers, released this week, were not available yet March 29 when Buckley tweeted his claim. Instead, Buckley deferred to a March 12 report, which showed the $40 million deficit. Comparing final state budget figures to a point-in-time snapshot is not exactly an apples-to-apples comparison, since this budget will likely end with a different deficit than Buckley claims. But, at the time of his tweet, Buckley’s numbers were right on the money. We rate his claim Mostly True.	None	New Hampshire Democratic Party	None	None	None	2013-04-11T16:45:48	2013-03-29	['None']
pomt-03047	Virginia is "the number one state per capita in screening out people with mental illness from gun purchases."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2013/oct/07/ken-cuccinelli/cuccinelli-says-virginia-no-1-stopping-mentally-il/	GOP gubernatorial nominee Ken Cuccinelli says the state has made strides in keeping guns away from the mentally ill since the 2007 mass shooting at Virginia Tech. "What we’ve done in Virginia is we have become the number one state per capita in screening out people with mental illness from gun purchases," Cuccinelli said during a Sept. 25 debate with Democrat Terry McAuliffe. We wondered if Virginia really is No. 1. To support his statement, Cuccinelli campaign spokeswoman Anna Nix pointed to a chart in the Seattle Times that ranked states on that measure.The chart was based on figures compiled by Mayors Against Illegal Guns -- a gun control group started by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Those figures show Virginia had submitted 2,254 mental health records to the national background check system for every 100,000 residents in the state. That was the highest ratio among all states in late 2011. The gun control group said in a November 2011 version of its Fatal Gaps report that Virginia had been sharing records with the national background check database for a decade, but the volume of records shared increased after the 2007 Virginia Tech tragedy. In that case, Seung-Hui Cho, was able to purchase two handguns he used to kill 32 people despite going through federal and state background checks at licensed gun dealers, according to a 2009 panel report on the shooting to then Gov. Tim Kaine. Cho had been deemed a danger to himself by a Virginia court, and that normally would have made him ineligible to buy the weapons. But his information was not shared with the federal National Instant Background Check System, the panel said, because of ambiguities in Virginia’s guns laws. The Virginia Tech shootings sparked a nationwide examination of the national background check system. Congress passed a 2008 law providing incentives for states to submit mental health records to the national background check system, but they are under no requirement comply. Virginia also passed legislation expanding the mental health records that have to be sent to the federal and state background check databases. Mayors Against Illegal Guns notes on its interactive chart that in the wake of the massacre, Virginia became the national leader in submitting mental health records to the national background check system. It remained at the top of the group’s list until October 2012, Erika Soto Lamb, a spokeswoman for Mayors Against Illegal Guns, said in an e-mail. Since, then, however, Pennsylvania has vaulted from the bottom of the pack to the top. That month, according to the Pittsburgh Post Gazette, the Pennsylvania State Police resolved lengthy legal and technical problems and transmitted 643,167 mental health records to the NICS. The submission means that Pennsylvania has submitted about 5,003 mental health records to the national background check system per 100,000 residents. Virginia was a distant No. 2 in the latest report by the mayors’ group, which counts all submissions through Oct. 31, 2012. Virginia had sent 180,338 mental health records to NICS. That breaks down to about 2,220 records per 100,000 residents. Rounding out the Top 5 were Delaware, California and Washington. The Bottom 5, in descending order, were Oklahoma, Louisiana, North Dakota, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. The gun control group plans to issue an updated report in the coming weeks. Our ruling Cuccinelli said Virginia is "the number one state per capita in screening out people with mental illness from gun purchases." His claim is based on outdated numbers. Virginia used to be No.1, but was surpassed by Pennsylvania last year. Now, we’re a distant No. 2. That’s still impressive. So Cuccinelli’s statement is largely accurate but needs the clarification.

pomt-08315	She "led the fight to stop health insurance rate hikes and saved Rhode Island families over $150 million."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2010/oct/30/elizabeth-roberts/printed-words-undercut-truthfulness-lt-gov-roberts/	In her bid for reelection, Lt. Governor Elizabeth Roberts cites her efforts to keep health insurance costs down in Rhode Island. In her television ad called "Clear," a narrator says: "Elizabeth Roberts? She led the fight to stop health insurance rate hikes and saved Rhode Island families over $150 million dollars." Meanwhile, the words on the screen say "Elizabeth Roberts," "stopped insurance rate hikes," and "saved over $150 million." So what you see is a claim that Roberts "stopped insurance rate hikes" and what you hear is "led the fight to stop health insurance rate hikes." We wondered what was behind the claim. Roberts campaign manager Daniel Meuse told us that the ad referred to a 2009 request by Blue Cross and UnitedHealthCare of New England to raise rates. (Our files show the requested increases were as high as 16.3 percent. The insurance companies ultimately withdrew their requests, but succeeded in getting increases this year.) First of all, Roberts, as the lieutenant governor, has no ability to block rate hikes. That authority lies with Health Insurance Commissioner Christopher Koller. Meuse acknowledged that Roberts lacks any authority to stop a rate hike. But he said that she deserves credit for leading the campaign against the hikes, which is the claim made by the narrator. Meuse said Roberts met with business groups and rallied them against the proposal. "She was the only public official who went and testified." So we decided to check on her role as a leader of the opposition. A June 2, 2009 Providence Journal story about a Warwick news conference reported that Roberts joined business leaders to protest the proposed increases. We got through to three of the five business people mentioned in the story and asked whether Roberts led the fight. All agreed. J. Michael Vittoria, president of the Rhode Island Business Group on Health, which represents 75 small and large employers, said there was plenty of opposition to the rate hikes proposal and it probably would have been expressed to some degree, but Roberts and her office successfully focused it. "If the question is whether she was responsible for making that happen? My opinion is, yes she was. I'm not saying it wouldn't have happened without her doing it, but I think she was the point of the spear there," said Vittoria. "Essentially, she led the way in terms of getting a number of different businesses together to articulate what everybody felt anyway." "I would absolutely characterize her as someone who led the fight for the repeal of this increase," said Donald Nokes, president of NetCenergy in Warwick, who joined Vittoria and Roberts to lobby against the plan on talkradio. "It came at a very bad time and it just wasn't something we felt should be accepted." Linda Lulli, an associate vice president for human resources at Bryant University, agreed that Roberts helped rally opposition. "In think the visibility and that level of involvement of the stakeholders, I think, had some influence on the changes that were made by the [insurance] carriers and their positions." As for the $150 million estimate, Koller told us in an email that "the 150 figure was my office's estimate, at that time, of the annual aggregate incremental costs which employers would have paid for health insurance had the rates submitted by the three insurers been approved." One other important point: Roberts talks about saving Rhode Island families over $150 million dollars. But in employer-sponsored health plans, employees usually pay a portion of the premium. It's the businesses that save most of the money. In addition, many employees do not have families. For that reason, when it comes to the verbal claim, the Roberts assertion isn't completely true. And because the words that appear on the commercial make the untrue claim that she blocked the increase, it further undercuts her -- to use the Stephen Colbert word -- truthiness. So rate her seem claim as Half True.	None	Elizabeth Roberts	None	None	None	2010-10-30T00:01:00	2010-10-28	['Rhode_Island']
pomt-02821	Mark Warner cast "the tiebreaking vote" to pass Obamacare.	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2013/nov/25/ken-cuccinelli/cuccinelli-says-warner-cast-tiebreaking-vote-obama/	Republican Ken Cuccinelli’s narrow loss in the Nov. 5 gubernatorial election has spurred talk about whether he’ll challenge U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat who’s up for reelection next year. In a Nov. 18 article in The Washington Post, Cuccinelli said he found the idea of running against Warner "tempting," particularly given the troubled rollout of the Affordable Care Act, which Warner helped pass in the Senate. "You were the tiebreaking vote," Cuccinelli said of Warner and his support for the ACA, also known as Obamacare. We wondered whether Warner really did cast the tiebreaking ballot that allowed Obamacare to survive. Brian Gottstein, a spokesman for Cuccinelli, told us Warner provided the critical vote in 2009 that prevented a Senate filibuster on the ACA. "(Sixty) votes were needed to avoid a filibuster and allow the legislation to pass, so there was not one vote to spare" Gottstein wrote in an e-mail. "Mark Warner provided that vote." Gottstein was referring to the Senate’s cloture rule that requires 60 votes in the 100-member chamber to end debate on most types of legislation and allow an up or down vote on the bill. On Dec. 23, 2009, the Senate voted 60-39 to halt debate on Obamacare. Warner joined all of his fellow Democrats and two independents in voting to stop a threatened Republican filibuster. The next day, the Senate passed Obamacare with an identical 60-39 vote. But Warner’s vote wasn’t as important this time because only a simple majority was required to approve the legislation. So let’s return to the filibuster-breaking roll call. No doubt, Warner’s vote was crucial to ending debate, as were ballots of 59 other senators. But does that mean that Warner was "the tiebreaking vote," as Cuccinelli says? It turns out that Republicans and conservative groups across the country have accused a lot of the Democratic senators of casting the key vote that unchained Obamacare. PolitiFact national noted in June 2012 the 60 Plus Association ran an ad claiming Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., cast "the deciding vote" that passed the law. In Ohio’s senate race last year, Republican Josh Mandel said Democratic incumbent Sherrod Brown cast "the deciding vote." In Michigan, Pennsylvania and Missouri, conservatives charged that Democratic Sens. Debbie Stabenow, Bob Casey and Claire McCaskill, respectively, were each "the deciding vote." And let’s not forget New Hampshire, where GOP candidate Jim Rubens said earlier this month that Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen was "the deciding vote" to pass Obamacare. That’s six "deciding votes" even before Warner was added to the list. Warner’s vote was hardly a mystery in late 2009 as the Senate neared the 60-vote majority to end debate. The Virginia Democrat, in a floor speech that Sept. 23, urged Congress to move forward on health care reforms. The Los Angeles Times, in a Dec. 24, 2009 article, said the final two holdouts to join the super majority were Sens. Joseph Lieberman, I-Conn., and Ben Nelson, D-Neb. Our ruling Cuccinelli said Warner provided "the tiebreaking vote" that allowed Obamacare to become reality. There’s a sliver of truth here in that Warner did indeed provide a crucial vote that helped Democrats get to the 60 votes needed to advance the Affordable Care Act. But it’s misleading to say he cast "the vote" when Warner was joined by 59 other senators who, by Cuccinelli’s rationale, also would have cast the tie-breaking vote. Warner was not among the last holdouts that boosted the Senate to a super majority; he made his intentions known three months before the vote. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-05446	Says George Norcross said the "TAKEOVER OF RUTGER$ CAMDEN WILL COST NEW JER$EY BILLION$."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/apr/26/r2rmerge/student-group-r2rmerge-claims-george-norcross-said/	An official estimate of the cost to merge two universities in southern New Jersey has not been released, but a student group claims a Democratic power broker put a multibillion-dollar price tag on the proposal. R2RMerge, a student movement at Rutgers-Camden, has taken to the web and to the streets to rally opposition to a plan to merge their school with Rowan University in Glassboro. The group is soliciting signatures for an online petition, as well as distributing literature to stop the controversial merger. A flier from the group found April 15 in a Jersey City grocery store states: "TAKEOVER OF RUTGER$ CAMDEN WILL COST NEW JER$EY BILLION$" The flier attributes the statement to a Feb. 7 interview South Jersey power broker George Norcross did on WHYY’s Radio Times program. With the lack of an official cost estimate, PolitiFact New Jersey questioned whether Norcross, who supports the reorganization, put a number on the proposal. Norcross did not, although he did say New Jersey taxpayers would need to approve multibillion-dollar bond issues to boost investment in higher education. During the Feb. 7 interview, Norcross cited a statistic that many have used to highlight the need for more investment in New Jersey colleges: the state ranks 47th nationally for higher education appropriations. Later in the interview, while discussing that the merged schools would not carry the Rutgers name, Norcross said: "I believe the students that are at that campus today are entitled to have their diploma say Rutgers University. I think there is a legitimate debate and discussion that needs to take place as to what happens after that because change is never easy. "But the amount of money that is involved in a reorganization of higher ed and an initiative to advance New Jersey from 47th in the country to the top 10 in the country is going to involve the voters of this state approving multibillion-dollar bond issues and southern New Jersey, undoubtedly, would receive its fair share of capital dollars, which historically it has not," he said. Norcross elaborated on his point to PolitiFact New Jersey. "What I was talking about was the long-awaited and sought capital spending initiative for higher education that would accompany a reorganization agreement statewide," he said. The proposed merger of Rutgers-Camden and Rowan is part of a larger reorganization plan that includes the restructuring of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey in Newark, as well as the merger of the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, the Cancer Institute of New Jersey and the School of Public Health from UMDNJ to Rutgers-New Brunswick. Norcross mentioned a recent Bloomberg News article about a plan for New Jersey to sell up to $3.5 billion in bonds for capital investments at state colleges. "That’s not the cost of the reorganization," Norcross said. "That’s to invest in the universities and colleges." A spokesman for R2RMerge, Michael Edelman, said in an e-mail that "it’s easily discernible from the punctuation, word-choice, design, and spelling that the flier is not meant to be a direct quote from George Norcross." "Thus, we think the issue shouldn’t be framed as whether George Norcross literally said that verbatim, but whether his comments reasonably lead to that conclusion. And, in that sense, we think it safe to draw the conclusion we did," Edelman said. Our ruling A flier distributed by the student group R2RMerge claims Norcross said during a February radio interview that the takeover of Rutgers-Camden will cost New Jersey billions. A cost estimate for the merger has not been stated publicly. During the interview Norcross said efforts to restructure higher education in New Jersey and boost the state’s national ranking for investment in higher education is "going to involve the voters of this state approving multibillion-dollar bond issues and southern New Jersey, undoubtedly, would receive its fair share of capital dollars, which historically it has not." Norcross’s comments referred to overall restructuring and investment in higher education, not folding Rutgers-Camden into Rowan University. We rate the claim False.

pomt-04211	Says legislation supported by gay rights activists would strip "mother" and "father" from future Texas birth certificates.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2012/nov/30/texas-values/conservative-group-says-legislative-proposal-would/	The leader of a conservative group launched this year warns that legislation supported by gay rights advocates would amend every future birth certificate. In a Nov. 19, 2012, interview with Austin’s KTBC-TV, Channel 7, Jonathan Saenz, president of Texas Values, which says it seeks to preserve and advance a culture of family values, said he doesn’t expect the measure to pass into law. But "if this change is made in the law," Saenz said, "it affects everyone’s birth certificates. That means the birth certificates the way they are now, the forms, would not say ‘mother’ and ‘father.’" Mom and Dad absent from birth certificates? Asked the basis of his claim, Saenz told us by email the proposal filed by Rep. Rafael Anchia, D-Dallas, for consideration by the 2013 Legislature strips references to a mother and father from supplemental birth certificates, which describes certificates mostly issued in adoption cases. Saenz said in the TV interview: "So if you wanted them, any parent wants them," meaning birth certificates, "they’re not going to have ‘mother’ and ‘father’ on there. So this isn’t just about the homosexual lobby wanting their rights. It’s partly about that issue, but this change in the law would impact everyone’s birth certificates." Chuck Smith, executive director of Equality Texas, which says it lobbies for the elimination of discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity/expression, said in an email and online post that partly because Anchia’s House Bill 201 only applies to birth certificates issued in adoption cases, Saenz’s claim is incorrect, a critique that Anchia echoed by telephone. Smith initially brought Saenz’s claim to our attention. Nearly 30,000 so-called "supplemental" birth certificates were filed by the state from September 2011 through August 2012, according to Christine Mann, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of State Health Services, which filed nearly 388,000 regular birth certificates, the kind issued after babies are born, in the period. Both types, once issued, look the same, she said by email. Anchia’s proposal would replace a provision in the Texas Health and Safety Code saying that on a supplemental birth certificate, one parent must be a female, named as the mother, and the other a male, named as the father. The law would say instead that the "supplementary birth certificate of an adopted child must be in the names of both adoptive parents," not specifying genders. The measure would take effect in September 2013. The way the law now works for same-sex couples is that one adoptive parent must choose to be designated as the father, in the case of a male couple, or the mother, in the case of a female couple, and the other parent is not listed on the resulting birth certificate, according to information posted online by State Health Services. By email, Mann confirmed that the 1997 Legislature put the gender-specific requirement in place of the previous law requiring only that parents be listed. So, would mother and father fade from Texas birth certificates in general? We noticed that the fiscal note for a similar proposal offered by Anchia in the 2011 session quotes State Health Services as saying relevant forms would be modified to show "Parent 1" and "Parent 2." In contrast, the "Certificate of Adoption" form now filled out to obtain a supplemental birth certificate has spaces for applicants to designate the child’s mother and father. By phone, two lawyers with expertise in adoption cases told us they do not read Anchia’s proposal as Saenz does. Michael Lackmeyer of Killeen said the proposal solely relates to birth certificates in adoption cases, not the vast majority issued after babies are born. Also, he said, he believes the state could keep the existing application for supplemental certificates, perhaps amended with instructions stating the adopting mother need not be a female nor the father a male. "I don’t really think it’s going to do quite what the opposition thinks it’s going to do," Lackmeyer said. Jeff Barnett of Austin agreed, saying nothing in the proposal should lead to certificates issued after birth losing "mother" and "father" designations. All the proposal does is remove the hurdle that one adopting parent be male and the other female, Barnett said. In contrast, Mann of State Health Services offered an uncertain analysis, saying by email that while the proposal may not appear to affect all certificates, that remains a possibility. If the "modification is made to only supplementary birth records, it may have the effect of identifying adopted persons," Mann wrote. "If you modify just the supplementary birth records of adopted persons by including only gender-neutral references to the parents (e.g. ‘parent 1’ and ‘parent 2’) and leave all other birth records with the ‘mother’ and ‘father’ references, that gender neutral reference/record distinguishes adopted person’s records and thus identifies them, which under current state law, is prohibited. As a result," she said, "we would have to have a consistent reference on all birth certificates going forward so as to not bring attention to those which are for adopted persons." We had asked Mann if Anchia's proposal would result in "mother" and "father" entries going away from all certificates. She replied: "The answer may be no if we can find a way to add ‘or parent’ ‘or co-parent’ or some other additional category along with ‘mother’ and ‘father’ to provide the gender-neutral option provided by the (legislation) on all certificates such as ‘Mother or Parent 1’ and ‘Father or Parent 2.’ This may be an issue of space on the certificates, so it’s unclear at this point if this is an option." Mann also said the agency "would need to modify more than 20 forms which currently reflect the names of the mother and father to show parent and co-parent to comply with this bill. These modifications would result in programming changes which must be made to the Texas Electronic Registrar and Remote Issuance systems, as well as the Texas.gov web portal. These changes would affect all birth certificates yet to be issued. It would not affect birth certificates already issued." Finally, we ran her comments by Saenz, Smith and the outside lawyers. Saenz said they uphold his claim. Smith stressed that no form changes are required by Anchia’s proposal. Lackmeyer said by email that "even though the changes address only supplemental" birth certificates, "who knows what any state agency will do to the entire system to implement that minor change?" By email, Barnett said the proposal still does not mandate the removal of "mother" and "father" from certificates. Our ruling The leader of Texas Values says a proposed change in law would strip "mother" and "father" from Texas birth certificates. The proposal would eliminate a requirement that adoptive couples seeking a birth certificate list a male father and female mother. But nothing in the proposal explicitly removes mother and father entries on certificates and it seems reasonable to us that any needed tweaks could be made without Moms and Dads vanishing from them. Then again, the state agency spokeswoman was uncertain about the proposal's effect, which sways us to say that Saenz's claim has an element of truth. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-13272	"Refugees are subject to more rigorous screening than the average tourist in the U.S."	true	/global-news/statements/2016/oct/13/barack-obama/refugee-summit-obama-claims-refugees-us-are-screen/	As the Syrian civil war rages on, the refugee crisis was a major subject of debate at the United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York last month. Many nations remain suspicious of refugees from the Middle East, fearful that some may be terrorists or criminals. In a speech to the Leader’s Summit on Refugees on Sept. 20, President Barack Obama strongly pushed back against this suspicion. He made an impassioned argument for countries to increase humanitarian aid to conflict zones and accept their fair share of refugees. "In recent years, in the United States, we’ve worked to put in intensive screening and security checks, so we can welcome refugees and ensure our security. In fact, refugees are subject to more rigorous screening than the average tourist," he said. Officials at government agencies have made similar statements, saying that refugees are subject to the most intense screening of any visitors to the United States. His claim comes at a time when politicians such as Donald Trump are casting doubt on the government’s ability to vet refugees and make sure they don’t pose a threat to the country. We were interested in comparing the screening process for tourists and refugees to see whether Obama’s claim is correct. Comparing the protocols We first looked at the Department of Homeland Security’s official protocols for tourist and refugee screening, and outlined the major components of each one below: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com First, travelers from 38 countries such as the U.K., Australia, and Japan can apply for the visa waiver program. This allows them to travel to the United States for 90 days or less without applying for a visa. Applicants must have passports with special security features, and need to obtain approval through the Electronic System for Travel Authorization, an automated screening system for passengers. Visitors that don’t apply for a visa waiver need to apply for a visitor’s visa. Prospective visitors need to have a valid passport, resume, and photo ID in order to complete the DS-160, which is the major online nonimmigrant visa application. They also need to pass a visa interview, where they’re often asked to provide evidence of their trip’s purpose. For example, a visiting scientist may have to bring a document proving that they will attend a research symposium in the United States. The waiting time to obtain a visitor’s visa depends on the traveler’s country of origin, but typically takes between several weeks to several months. A visitor’s visa usually lasts six months, but can be extended through an additional application process. The listed screening process for refugees is more complicated, and frequently takes at least two years to complete. According to the White House’s website, refugees are first identified, assessed, and interviewed by UNHCR, the United Nations’ refugee agency. Applicants then go through a strict screening process while still overseas. They face security checks and interviews with at least four federal agencies, such as the FBI and the State Department. The Department of Homeland Security then interviews the candidate again with specially trained officers from the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. Applicant’s fingerprints are also gathered and cross-referenced to terrorist watch lists, and they must pass medical screenings and attend cultural orientation classes. Refugees from Syria face additional security checks and may be referred to fraud detection experts in Homeland Security. According to the State Department, around half of refugee applicants are ultimately admitted to the United States. Obama was correct in saying that the refugee screening process is more rigorous that the tourist screening process, at least in theory. But does it always turn out that way in real life? The risk of admitting terrorists with each process David Martin, professor of law at the University of Virginia, told us that Obama’s statement is accurate. "The procedures are not merely theoretical," he said. "DHS has worked hard to develop procedures and effective lines of inquiry specific to refugee populations, and they are fully employed." For example, even if refugee applicants initially passes a certain stage, they face the prospect of recurrent vetting. If they provide any new biographical information in the vetting process, the entire round of security checks with federal agencies is repeated. Additionally, pending applications are constantly reviewed against terrorist databases to watch for new threats. If any potential concern comes up, the application is paused and reviewed again. Martin acknowledges that no security screening is completely foolproof. One of the largest challenges facing refugee screening is a lack of access to government data in war-torn countries. Because the U.S. government can only work with the data it can obtain, verifying people’s identities in countries where records may be missing or destroyed is more difficult. In fact, the tourist screening process could potentially be more prone to letting terrorists in, according to Anne Speckhard, associate professor of psychiatry at Georgetown University. Of particular concern to her and other experts is the relative laxity of the visa waiver program. "In my view the most danger of an ISIS cadre making it to the United States is the visa waiver form, so for instance, a European ISIS cadre who comes as a ‘tourist’ but is really a terrorist," she said. "It’s hard for me to believe an ISIS cadre would expose himself to so long vetting process and wait for two years to enter the United States when it’s so much easier to get here through visa waiver." Speckhard said that the majority of Syrian refugees pose no danger to the United States and simply wish to flee repression from either ISIS or the Syrian government. She argued that some refugees are highly educated and have much to contribute. Matt Mayer of the American Enterprise Institute told us that Obama’s use of the word "average" makes his claim correct, due to the low level of screening that visa waiver applicants receive. But because refugees are coming to the United States permanently, as opposed to tourists’ brief visits, Obama is making a false comparison. Mayer said refugees should be extensively screened due to widespread problems with document fraud and verifying people’s identities. Our Ruling Obama said, "Refugees are subject to more rigorous screening than the average tourist in the U.S." Reviewing the government’s vetting protocols confirms that refugees face a far stricter and longer process than tourists for entering the United States. The experts we consulted agreed that the refugee protocol is strictly enforced and more difficult than the screening process that tourists go through. We rate his claim True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c81c169f-1d88-43cc-bdc0-39a481f8658a	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2016-10-13T15:02:10	2016-09-20	['United_States']
pomt-02173	"Some of the wealthiest Americans are African-American now."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/apr/29/rush-limbaugh/limbaugh-some-wealthiest-americans-are-african-ame/	There’s the truth, there’s distortions and then there’s Rush Limbaugh’s April 28, 2014, radio show. In it, the conservative American radio talk show host decided to discuss the racist comments allegedly made by Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling. At one point, Limbaugh described Sterling as "a typical Hollywood Democrat." That’s incorrect (Sterling is a registered Republican -- to the extent it matters). "The only reason (Sterling’s) in trouble right now is he did not give enough money to Obama," Limbaugh proclaimed. That’s highly speculative, so we can’t fact-check Limbaugh on this point. At another point in his Sterling talk, Limbaugh discussed how things generally are going for African-Americans in the United States. Limbaugh’s diagnosis: pretty darn good. "You've got a black president. You've got a black attorney general. You've got the wealthiest TV performer in American history is a African-American woman. That would be The Oprah," Limbaugh said. "Some of the wealthiest Americans are African-American now." That last line is quite incorrect. The go-to source to learn about the wealthiest Americans is Forbes, which tracks the fortunes of the world’s elite. It publishes an annual list of the 400 wealthiest Americans and a list of the world’s billionaires. The most recent Forbes list was released in March 2014. (Bloomberg also publishes a less expansive list of the world’s billionaires.) For some perspective, the folks at the bottom of Forbes’ wealthiest Americans list are worth an estimated $1.3 billion. At the top is Bill Gates, who is worth an estimated $72 billion. How many African-Americans make up the American Top 400? One, according to Forbes. Oprah Winfrey is worth an estimated $2.9 billion -- ranking her 184th on the list. For the record, it isn’t only rare for African-Americans to be billionaires in the United States. According to Forbes, there are only nine black billionaires in the world. So who are the wealthiest African-Americans besides Winfrey? We found two other lists using Forbes data that are a few years old. Here’s a list, with the date of the last update: Entertainer Sean "Diddy" Combs, $550 million (April 2012) BET founder Robert Johnson, $550 million (May 2009) Golfer Tiger Woods, $500 million (September 2010) Former basketball player Michael Jordan, $500 million (September 2010) Former basketball player Magic Johnson, $500 million (May 2009) That means no African-American other than Oprah Winfrey is even close to cracking the Top 400 list. Our ruling Limbaugh said, "Some of the wealthiest Americans are African-American now." We reached out to Limbaugh with our finding but have not heard back. Of the top 400 wealthiest Americans, exactly one is African-American -- that’s .25 percent. Also, no other African-American is really all that close to breaking into the Top 400. Limbaugh’s claim severely distorts reality. We rate it False.	None	Rush Limbaugh	None	None	None	2014-04-29T12:14:59	2014-04-28	['United_States']
pomt-06974	House Bill 2301 never had a public hearing	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2011/jul/14/oregon-education-association/did-controversial-online-charter-school-bill-reall/	In order for Gov. John Kitzhaber to get what he wanted on education reform this session -- a new investment board, for example -- legislators agreed to vote on a package of 14 education-related bills. One of those bills, House Bill 2301, will allow online charter schools to add more students and was vigorously opposed by the public teachers’ union, the Oregon Education Association. Just before the Fourth of July holiday, the group submitted a guest column on Blue Oregon, pleading with the governor to veto House Bill 2301: "What makes this whole debacle even more unpalatable is that the public was completely shut out of the backroom dealing. HB 2301 never had a public hearing. Parents, educators, and school leaders were never given the opportunity to weigh in and talk about how this will impact kids in the classroom." The sentiment is one that we’re bound to hear again. Democrats complained about the lack of process over the education bills, with then-House Democratic Leader Dave Hunt of Gladstone arguing that there were "no public hearings, no vetting of amendments, no real fiscal analysis." Rep. Sara Gelser, D-Corvallis, and co-chairwoman of the House Education Committee echoed his frustration. But a fed-up Rep. Brian Clem, D-Salem, shot back that there had been hearings on the bill, back in February. (Clem also said, we can’t help but add, "You're either going to be a mature adult and be at the big kids’ table and figure out how to make things work, or you're going to throw tantrums and write press releases and sit at the little kids' table. And I'm going to be at the big kids’ table." Ouch.) So what gives? Who’s right? Did House Bill 2301 get a public hearing? Well, yes and no. A bill with that number was the subject of two public hearings Feb. 11 and 14, 2011, in the House Education Committee. But that wasn’t the bill that lawmakers approved in the final days of the Legislature. The bill as introduced was 62 pages long, with parts stemming from a comprehensive State Board of Educationreport on virtual learning to the Legislature. Part of the reason why the bill is so long is that the board wanted to separate virtual school law from charter school law. The proposal also contained provisions to increase the enrollment cap and to establish funding per child since in Oregon, state money follows the student. The final bill is six pages long. It contains two key elements important to virtual schools, not to the broad expanse of online education. One, the legislation states that at least 95 percent of instructional time be delivered by a state licensed teacher. Two, the legislation also allows online charter schools to enroll as much as 3 percent of a school district's population without getting permission from the district. Currently, students need to get permission from their local school districts to enroll in an online school. The teacher licensing requirement was not in the original bill. The 3 percent enrollment cap was in the original bill. What happened is in legislative lingo called a "gut and stuff." Lawmakers take a bill already in process, "gut" the contents and "stuff" in a new bill under the old number. (Even the bill’s carrier on the floor, Rep. John Huffman, R-The Dalles, called the amended version "a complete gut and stuff of the original bill.") Audio records of committee hearings show that the amended version cropped up days before the House floor vote and moved through two budget committees without discussion or debate because of the deal struck by Kitzhaber and Republicans. So if the final bill bore little to no resemblance to the original bill, were there hearings on the issues in it? (Hint: Does a slice of pie look like a whole pie, especially when there’s a piece of cake frosting on top of the slice?) We listened to those two public hearings in February. The public comments were broad, general. Fans of Oregon Connections Academy, a popular for-profit virtual school known as ORCA, testified on the benefits of online schooling and pleaded for more state money. An ORCA instructor said the school would have to drop advanced course offerings if teachers were required to acquire state teaching licenses and live in Oregon. There were some questions by committee legislators, including the issue of licensing. Rep. Matt Wingard, R-Wilsonville, and the other co-chairman of the House Education Committee, said the issues included in the original legislation were aired in February, and the teachers’ union had plenty of time then and in months leading to the floor vote to pipe up. Wingard also says the final version of the bill was negotiated by both Democrats and Republicans. PolitiFact Oregon doesn’t have a problem with legislative dealmaking. It happens. But we don’t agree with Wingard that public hearings on the original bill mean hearings on the version that passed. There was no public discussion -- and there was no discussion among lawmakers in public -- on the details of how taxpayers should govern, encourage, monitor and pay for online education, including online schools. There was no negotiating in public the version put to legislators as part of a final deal. The bill that passed bypassed the comprehensive nature of the original House Bill 2301. Elements of the final bill were discussed, in passing, but the heart of it did not receive a public hearing. The claim that the legislation received no public hearing is Mostly True -- accurate but needing additional clarification. Comment on this item.

pomt-01266	"One-hundred times as many people worked their way from poverty into the American middle class" during his presidency compared to Ronald Reagan's presidency.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/nov/07/bill-clinton/did-100-times-more-people-ascend-middle-class-unde/	Campaigning for Mary Burke in Milwaukee on Oct. 24, 2014, Bill Clinton reflected on his presidency, sizing it up against Ronald Reagan's. "The thing I'm proudest of was that, as compared with President Reagan's term, we created 45 percent more jobs," Clinton said during a speech for Burke, who 10 days later lost her bid to unseat Gov. Scott Walker. He continued: "But 100 times -- listen to this -- 100 times as many people worked their way from poverty into the American middle class. That’s the way this economy should work." Clinton made the same claim a month earlier on CNN. One-hundred times as many? Now, that’s a statistic begging to be checked. Background on the issue Clinton, a Democrat, was elected in November 1992 and served two terms, from January 1993 to January 2001. Reagan, a Republican, was elected in November 1980 and also served eight years, from January 1981 to January 1989. Clinton’s spokesman cited census figures showing that there was a net decrease of nearly 7.7 million people living in poverty from 1993 to 2000. That’s 100 times more than the 77,000 fewer under Reagan from 1981 to 1988. But there’s some cherry picking going on in that comparison. Why? A president is elected in November but does not take office until January. To be consistent, you need to stick to one or the other. Earlier in 2014, Hillary Clinton made a claim similar to the one Bill Clinton made in Milwaukee. PolitiFact National rated it False. Our colleagues looked at two-eight year frames: Election years, which were 1992 to 2000 for Clinton and 1980 to 1988 for Reagan; and the years the men took office and left office -- 1993 to 2001 for Clinton and 1981 to 1989 for Reagan. Our colleagues found similar trends for each time frames, then reported figures based on the second time frame. During the eight years under Clinton, the number of Americans in poverty declined by 6.5 million -- 22 times more than the 294,000 under Reagan. That’s a lot, but it’s not 100 times. There’s one other problem with Clinton’s claim, given that he cited not simply the number of people no longer living in poverty but those that moved from poverty to the "middle class." His spokesman provided no evidence to indicate how many people moved into the middle class. Jonathan Schwabish, economist and senior researcher at the Urban Institute, told us there is no consensus on what constitutes the middle class. He also said it would be hard argue that all of the people who climbed out of poverty had entered the middle class. Indeed, a person whose income was $1 above the poverty line would no longer officially be living in poverty, but probably wouldn’t feel as though he or she had suddenly joined the middle class. Our rating Clinton said "100 times as many people worked their way from poverty into the American middle class" during his presidency compared to Reagan's presidency. Measured one way -- from the year each president took office to the election year in which each last served -- the number of people no longer living in poverty under Clinton was 100 times more than the number under Reagan. But a consistent measure -- from the year each president took office to the year each president left office -- shows the figure under Clinton was only 22 times higher. What’s more, Clinton provided no evidence that all the people lifted out of poverty during his tenure had entered the middle class. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.

pomt-00469	A proposed constitutional amendment "will pave the way for making abortion illegal under North Carolina’s constitution."	pants on fire!	/north-carolina/statements/2018/aug/14/bluenc/could-nc-constitutional-amendment-make-abortion-il/	This election, North Carolina voters will have the option of making six changes to the state Constitution. One of them, commonly referred to as the "victims’ rights" or "Marsy’s Law" amendment, would add more protections and rights for crime victims in the legal process. The amendment was pushed by an advocacy group, Marsy’s Law for All, founded to prevent situations like the one experienced by the family of Marsy Nicholas. Nicholas was stalked and killed by her ex-boyfriend in 1983, according to the Marsy’s Law for NC website. A week after Marsy’s death, her family was confronted by her accused murderer in a grocery store and the family "had no idea that he had been released on bail," the site says. The proposed amendment would include granting victims’ families the constitutional right to be present at court proceedings of accused felons, the right to be informed of a jury’s ruling, and the right to know if the convicted perpetrator has escaped or been released from prison. Among the most common criticisms of the proposal is that it might slow the legal system and add costs. However, a completely different worry recently emerged on the BlueNC blog, which is run by former Democratic gubernatorial candidate James Protzman. Protzman created a poster describing each of the amendments. "Victim’s rights will be extended to any class of people the legislature wants, including fetuses. This amendment will pave the way for making abortion illegal under North Carolina’s constitution," the Blue NC description of the victims’ rights amendment says. PolitiFact doesn’t often focus on blogs unless their content becomes widely distributed. In this case, the poster was shared on Facebook by Wayne Goodwin, chairman of the North Carolina Democratic Party, and Goodwin’s post was shared more than 700 times. ‘Who knows?’ Abortion is legal in the United States but regulations vary by state. For example, in North Carolina, there are restrictions on abortion after 20 weeks, and taxpayer money can’t be used for abortions except for pregnancies caused by rape, incest or where the mother’s life is endangered, according to the Guttmacher Institute, an advocacy group that promotes sexual and reproductive health and rights in the United States. North Carolina also gives medical providers the right to refuse abortion services and requires potential abortion patients to wait 72 hours after a consultation, the institute says. When contacted by PolitiFact, Protzman explained by email he’s critical of all six amendments because they’re vague. He pointed to this line in the legislation: "The victim or, if the victim is a minor, is legally incapacitated, or deceased, a family member, guardian, or legal custodian may assert the rights provided in this section." "So let’s say you’re the estranged husband of a woman who has an abortion. Under this amendment, you could assert all the rights of a family member on behalf of the fetus, and then impose the requirements of the amendment on your estranged wife. You could even assert, on behalf of the ‘victim,’ that felony murder took place," Protzman said. "Would this happen? Who knows? But it could. And given the willingness of Sen. Berger and Speaker Moore to bend legislative rules to suit their agendas, I wouldn’t bet against it," he added. But that hypothetical scenario is not only extremely unlikely, experts said, it’s also irrelevant. The victims’ rights amendment, which has no mention of abortion or reproductive rights, would still have no bearing on the legal status of abortion in North Carolina. ‘Absurd’ Gregory Wallace, a professor at Campbell University School of Law, noted the amendment applies only to people who are victims of a crime, and identifies specific procedures the court must follow to grant those rights. He described Protzman’s claim as "absurd." "The proposed amendment does not authorize a person to accuse someone of a crime or to make something a crime that is not already unlawful," Wallace said in an email. "Under the Constitution and current law, the aborted child is not treated as a victim of a crime," Wallace continued. "The aborted child therefore would not have any rights under the proposed amendment, nor does the proposed amendment do anything to change current abortion law." Marsy’s Law for NC, the group pushing the amendment, echoed that sentiment. "Marsy’s Law is not about abortion rights — it’s about strengthening rights for victims of crime," the group said through Chris Sinclair, general consultant for the Marsy’s Law for NC campaign. "Special interest groups are in high gear on social media spreading misinformation about Marsy’s Law, the amendment that will strengthen constitutional rights for victims of crime in North Carolina," the statement says. "Their glib misinformation campaign is an attempt to mislead voters, and ultimately will hurt crime victims and their families who deserve equal rights in the state constitution - rights that the accused and convicted already have." Skye David, an attorney with New Frame in Raleigh, focuses on victims of sexual assault as part of her lobbying work. She told PolitiFact in an email the proposed law could, in theory, apply to an abortion case. But it’s "unlikely that it could qualify as felony murder because there would be no attempt to commit a felony under (statute)." "I’m certainly open to hearing how this could/would be more common, but don’t think that this would be a common or even uncommon case." The proposal is unlikely to pave the way for making abortion illegal, she said. Federal law trumps state law John Dinan, an expert on the N.C. Constitution who teaches at Wake Forest University, says he has kept track of the states that started adopting victims’ rights amendments, a trend that started in the 1980s, and then the second wave of states that adopted Marsy’s Law amendments. "Of the various critiques that have been advanced about these amendments during the campaigns — and there have been various critiques — concerns about the effects on abortion rights have not figured prominently in the debates and campaigns about the amendments," Dinan told PolitiFact in an email. "Far more common have been concerns about whether these amendments will place an undue burden on prosecutors and court systems." The proposed North Carolina constitutional amendment is no different, he said. "In looking at the original victims’ rights amendment (added to the North Carolina Constitution in 1996) and then examining the changes that would be made by the 2018 Marsy’s Law amendment, it is not clear to me which of the 2018 changes would have the claimed effect on abortion rights," Dinan said. Jeff Powell, an expert at Duke University, emphasized that the state can’t pass any new abortion restrictions that violate federal law. And the Supreme Court has ruled that abortion rights are protected by the U.S. Constitution. "As long as there’s a federal constitutional rule on abortion, that trumps whatever North Carolina will do," Powell said. Our ruling BlueNC said the proposed victims’ rights constitutional amendment will "pave the way for making abortion illegal." Attorneys and legal experts say the path to such fallout not only is unclear, but unlikely. One expert described the claim as "absurd." And Protzman failed to offer evidence that an amendment which is completely unrelated to reproductive rights could outlaw abortion. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-14405	"Seventy percent of Missourians support voter photo ID legislation."	mostly true	/missouri/statements/2016/mar/14/caleb-rowden/rowden-mostly-right-about-missouri-residents-supp/	The debate over whether to require photo identification to vote continues in Missouri. Republicans argue photo IDs are necessary to safeguard the voting process from fraud, while Democrats warn that legislation would disenfranchise minority and poor voters. At a League of Women Voters’ town hall meeting in Columbia, state Rep. Caleb Rowden said most people are behind the idea. The Columbia Republican said "70 percent of Missourians support voter photo ID legislation." We decided to look into that. Rowden said he based his 70 percent figure on a poll conducted by Remington Research in Missouri Scout, a political subscription service. He also said he has internally polled the district he represents. The survey Rowden cited put the question this way: "The legislature is proposing to require voters to show a valid Missouri driver’s license or other valid identification in order to vote. Do you agree or disagree with this?" Remington’s poll said 70 percent of Missourians said they agreed, with results varying city-to-city. The hitch is that the poll does not clarify what "other valid identification" entails. Defining what does and does not constitute "valid identification" is the crux of a proposed Missouri bill. As Missouri law stands now, any form of ID issued by Missouri, the federal government or another state is accepted as proof of identity to vote. Those forms include driver’s licenses from another state, birth certificates, student IDs, utility bills and bank statements. Not all of those include a photo. In contrast, the Missouri bill would require one of four documents, all of which include photos: a Missouri driver’s license; a Missouri non-driver’s license (state ID); a military ID; or a national government-issued form of ID with a signature and photograph. Marvin Overby, MU professor of political science at , said changes in phrasing when it comes to survey research can lead to different results. "To a lot of people, it’s just common-sense rhetoric that you need a photo ID to do lots of things in life, including voting," he said. "But if the wording laid out more exact points, such as the fact that the proposed legislation doesn’t include student IDs or out-of-state licenses, you might get a different response." That said, evidence from national polling suggests Rowden might be on solid ground. Nationwide support for photo ID The Pew Research Center found that 77 percent of Americans supported photo voter ID requirements. A poll conducted by Rasmussen Reports this summer illustrated a similar trend, showing more than three-quarters of Americans are in favor of requiring a photo ID to vote. That poll asked, "Should voters be required to show photo identification such as a driver’s license before being allowed to vote?" Unlike the poll cited by Rowden, the Rasmussen Reports poll specifically defined a valid ID as one requiring a photo. Rasmussen Reports Managing Editor Fran Coombs said the goal is to keep any potential bias out of survey questions. "As a rule, we just try to keep the questioning as simple as possible," she said. "The important thing is not to influence the responses with the wording of the question." Even those who disagree with the idea of requiring photo identification don’t dispute that surveys show a high level of support for the idea. Missouri’s League of Women Voters’ Voter Protection and Service Director Kathleen Farrell said people might not know the details of the legislation that surveys ask about. "The average person might not know just how strict Missouri’s proposed legislation is," she said. "They also may not know how expensive it could be to require photo ID for all voters." The bill’s fiscal note allows for up to about $10.7 million dollars of funding; if the necessary funds were not allocated, the requirements for photo identification to vote would not be implemented. Our ruling Rowden’s statement that "70 percent of Missourians support voter photo ID identification" isn’t fully supported by the poll he provided. The poll Rowden cited only asks about "requiring Missouri driver’s licenses or other valid form of ID to vote." It doesn’t specify that the proposed legislation restricts valid identification to IDs that have photos. But national polls show about 75 percent of Americans support requiring a photo ID to vote. The wording in the poll Rowden cited is confusing, but the results mirror the national trend. We rate this statement Mostly True.

pomt-12888	"There's one (study) that came out of Pew in 2008 that showed 14 percent of people who voted were noncitizens."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/25/sean-spicer/sean-spicer-wrongly-uses-pew-study-bolster-claim-n/	Even after being sworn in as president, Donald Trump isn’t letting go of his unsubstantiated belief that millions of people voted illegally in November, costing him the popular vote. Now, he’s calling for a "major investigation" into voter fraud, he wrote in a Jan. 25 tweet. We have debunked Trump’s claims of massive voter fraud again and again and again (and again and again and again and again) over the past year. Trump has not yet produced any evidence that supports these claims — because none exists. In the Jan. 24 daily press briefing, a reporter asked White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer how Trump came to believe that it’s possible illegal votes were to blame for his popular vote loss. "I think there's been studies," Spicer responded. "There's one that came out of Pew in 2008 that showed 14 percent of people who voted were noncitizens. There's other studies that have been presented to him. It's a belief he maintains." Spicer is conflating a couple different studies that have been erroneously used to prop up claims that noncitizens have swayed elections by voting illegally. There is no study that shows 14 percent of the votes cast in 2008 were cast by noncitizens. That would have added up to more than 18 million fraudulent votes — an implausible assertion, considering the total noncitizen population was about 22.5 million in 2010. Pew study misinterpreted The study that "came out of Pew in 2008" actually came out in 2012, and it’s about outdated voter rolls, not fraudulent votes. The 2012 Pew study — titled, "Inaccurate, Costly, and Inefficient: Evidence That America’s Voter Registration System Needs an Upgrade" — makes no mention of noncitizens voting or registering to vote. Rather, it found that about 24 million, or one in every eight, voter registrations in the United States are inaccurate or no longer valid, but it did not find evidence of actual voter fraud. The study was about record-keeping that is badly managed and in disarray. Here’s what the former director of Pew’s election program said about the study in November: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Old Dominion study contested The study that shows "14 percent of people who voted were noncitizens" has been widely criticized for its methodology, and Spicer cites the findings incorrectly. The study Spicer likely meant to reference was conducted by professors at Old Dominion University and published in 2014. The researchers wrote in the Washington Post that about 14 percent of noncitizens in their sample said they were registered to vote, and they deduced that about 6 percent of noncitizens actually voted in the 2008 election. (That would mean somewhere in the ballpark of 1.3 million votes, using Census estimates of the noncitizen population.) So the study doesn’t show the statistic Spicer says it does. Beyond that, many credible researchers have panned the study as methodologically unsound for using an opt-in Internet poll originally designed to survey citizens and not considering possible survey response error. In a recent blog post, one of the authors, Old Dominion professor Jesse Richman, said he stands by his study, but "our results suggest that almost all elections in the US are not determined by noncitizen participation, with occasional and very rare potential exceptions." There might be a problem of noncitizens voting, but it’s not nearly as large as the statistic Spicer cites. These studies do not prop up Trump’s belief that millions of illegal votes cost him the popular vote. Hillary Clinton won almost 3 million more votes than Trump. So erasing Trump’s popular-vote deficit requires the assumption that all 3 million of these votes were cast illegally, and every one of them went to Clinton and not Trump. Further, no official sources or reputable academic sources have produced any evidence of large-scale voter fraud in the 2016 election, and numerous studies have shown that voter fraud is rare. Read our full debunking of Trump’s Nov. 28 claim that he "won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally." Our ruling Spicer said, "There's one (study) that came out of Pew in 2008 that showed 14 percent of people who voted were noncitizens." Spicer is both conflating and misquoting two studies: A 2012 Pew report about outdated voter rolls and a 2014 Old Dominion University study that found 6 percent of noncitizens surveyed voted in 2008. The Old Dominion University study has been widely criticized for its methodology. No study has found the statistic Spicer cites. If 14 percent of all voters in 2008 were noncitizens, that would have to mean that more than 80 percent of America’s noncitizen population voted. Spicer’s claim is False.

pomt-14694	"Our businesses have created jobs every single month since (Obamacare) became law."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/12/barack-obama/business-has-created-jobs-every-month-obamacare-be/	President Barack Obama touted the success of Obamacare during his final State of the Union address. He said the Affordable Care Act has led to nearly 18 million more people gaining health insurance and has helped to slow health care cost inflation. He added that the law didn’t destroy the job market, despite pessimistic predictions from critics. "Our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law," Obama said on Capitol Hill on Jan. 12, 2016. We hadn’t heard that particular Obamacare talking point before, so we decided to take a look. Because Obama referred specifically to "our businesses," we looked at private-sector employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics starting in March 2010, when Obama signed the Affordable Care Act. Of the 70 months since, Obama is correct that every single one has seen positive job growth. That’s a record for uninterrupted job growth, according to our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker. This graph from BLS shows monthly change in private-sector job growth (in thousands) since the start of 2010: From early 2010 on, the data is above the zero line, showing positive job growth. The fact that the country has gained jobs despite the health care law also might not assuage critics’ argument that job growth, and other aspects of the economy, would have been stronger absent the law. For example, in a January 2015 fact-check, we found that the law might have caused many thousands of employees to have their hours cut from full-time to part-time. But independent studies haven’t backed up claims that the law would end up reducing employment. In 2011, we rated a claim from former Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Va., that Obamacare is "job killing" False. Former Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, said in 2014 that Obamacare is "expected to destroy 2.3 million jobs." We rated that claim Mostly False. Our ruling Obama said, "Our businesses have created jobs every single month since (Obamacare) became law." The private sector has seen job growth every single month since Obama signed the Affordable Care Act in March 2010. There’s room for argument over what the growth would have looked like absent the health care law, but Obama’s statistic is on target. We rate this claim True.

pomt-10177	"President Eisenhower, on the night before the Normandy invasion...[wrote a] letter of resignation to the United States Army for the failure of the landings at Normandy."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/26/john-mccain/mccain-flubs-military-history/	Early in the first presidential debate, Sen. John McCain veered into military history during a discussion of the financial crisis. To make a point about accountability, he relayed an anecdote about Dwight D. Eisenhower. Only McCain got the story wrong in a way that undermined his point. After moderator Jim Lehrer pressed McCain on whether he would support the financial bailout package Congress is crafting, McCain said, "I hope so, sure." Then he said: "But there's also the issue of responsibility. You've mentioned President Dwight David Eisenhower. President Eisenhower, on the night before the Normandy invasion, went into his room and he wrote out two letters. One of them was a letter congratulating the great members of the military and Allies that had conducted and succeeded in the greatest invasion in history, still to this day, and forever. And he wrote out another letter, and that was a letter of resignation to the United States Army for the failure of the landings at Normandy. Somehow, we've lost that accountability." McCain went on to link Eisenhower and his letter to McCain's repeated calls in recent days that Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Christopher Cox resign for his role in the financial crisis. McCain was almost certainly referring to this note , which Eisenhower, then the U.S. Army general commanding the Normandy assault, prepared and stuck in his wallet on June 5, 1944, the day before the invasion in case the mission failed. It says: "Our landings in the Cherbourg-Havre area have failed to gain a satisfactory foothold and I have withdrawn the troops. My decision to attack at this time and place was based on the best information available. The troops, the air and the Navy did all that bravery and devotion to duty could do. If any blame or fault attaches to the attempt it is mine alone." A noble sentiment — but not a letter of resignation. "That must be what McCain is referencing," said David Fitzpatrick, a military historian at the University of Michigan. "I never heard that Eisenhower had prepared a letter of resignation. That would be incorrect." The invasion was a success and Eisenhower did not have to use the note. McCain ought not use it either — at least not as an example of prewritten resignation letter. Though Eisenhower did intend to take responsibility for the failure, that's quite different from preparing to resign his generalship. We find this anecdote to be False.

But that isn't substantiated at all. "Lisa Page squeals: DNC server was not hacked by Russians," said the July 17 headline by Your News Wire which frequently publishes fake news. This story was flagged as part Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found no credible evidence to back up the headline. Your News Wire largely drew from a story by The True Pundit about Page’s closed-door House hearings on July 13 and July 16. The True Pundit said the information came from "federal sources" and "well-placed FBI sources." The True Pundit said that Page alleged that the upper echelon of the FBI concealed intelligence confirming Chinese state-backed "assets" had illegally acquired former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s 30,000 "missing" emails. In 2016, the U.S. intelligence community concluded that the Russian government directed the recent theft of emails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations. Despite that, Trump has questioned whether the Russian government tried to interfere in the U.S. election. In 2016, Trump said it could have been China who hacked emails of Democratic operatives and the Democratic National Committee. Or someone "sitting on their bed who weighs 400 pounds." Page, a former FBI lawyer, has drawn attention from lawmakers because she and former FBI agent Peter Strzok exchanged anti-Trump text messages while having an affair. Both worked on the FBI's Russia investigation and for a brief time on Special Counsel Robert’s Mueller’s investigation. Strozak testified publicly for 10 hours on July 12. We don’t have access to Page’s testimony because it occurred in a closed-door session. News reports said Page didn’t answer reporters’ questions before or after her testimony and lawmakers revealed little. However, of the information that has emerged about her testimony and reported by the mainstream media, none of it indicated she blamed the Chinese. Conservative news outlets included Breitbart and The Daily Caller said that lawmakers indicated Page contradicted Strzok about their texts and focused on the issue of political bias at the FBI, but those articles didn’t indicate that she blamed China, either. The Washington Post reported that Republican lawyers said that Page provided new information that further convinced them that political bias marred the investigations of Hillary Clinton's emails and the Trump campaign's alleged ties to Russia. Page denied bias. Several right-wing websites have repeated the claim that Page contradicted the U.S. intelligence community and pointed the finger at China. We sent an email to Your News Wire and did not get a reply. PolitiFact evaluates information using on-the-record sources and information as of the time that a person or website makes a claim.

pomt-12925	"House GOP rules package bars CBO from counting spikes in deficit spending spurred by an ACA repeal."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/12/keith-ellison/keith-ellison-wrong-cbo-cant-analyze-cost-obamacar/	House rules don’t often become big news. This year was somewhat different. The biggest news in the 2017 rules package was an amendment to curb the power of the independent Office of Congressional Ethics. After a big public backlash and critical tweets by President-elect Donald Trump, the amendment was withdrawn. Somewhat less widely noticed, but which has come up periodically in pro-Democratic web posts and social media, was a provision that seemed to prevent the Congressional Budget Office from analyzing the cost of repealing the Affordable Care Act. If true, this would be significant, since the CBO, Congress’ number-crunching arm, is a respected independent referee on questions of how much legislative proposals will cost the federal treasury. If this happened, it would make it easier for Republicans to avoid answering the question of why they want to repeal a law at significant cost to the U.S. treasury. At least one lawmaker made an issue of this rules provision on Twitter: Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., who has taken on a higher profile due to his bid to become the next Democratic National Committee chairman. "House GOP rules package bars CBO from counting spikes in deficit spending spurred by an ACA repeal," Ellison tweeted on Jan. 5, 2017. It was retweeted more than 2,400 times and received 1,600 likes. The House rules package governs how the U.S. House of Representatives handles its basic procedures for the two-year duration of a congressional session. We wanted to know if it really contained what Ellison said. Spoiler alert: It doesn’t, as Ellison’s office now acknowledges. What the rules package says The passage in question can be found here in section 3, subsection h. The provision is laden with jargon, but the gist is this: The rules package established a new requirement for CBO to undertake an unusually long-term analysis for legislation, and then specifically freed the ACA repeal from this type of analysis. The rules package says that "the Director of the Congressional Budget Office shall, to the extent practicable, prepare an estimate of whether a bill or joint resolution reported by a committee (other than the Committee on Appropriations) ... would cause, relative to current law, a net increase in direct spending in excess of $5 billion in any of the four consecutive 10-fiscal year periods beginning with the first fiscal year that is 10 fiscal years after the current fiscal year." According to the rule, any bills flagged as adding to the deficit by this required CBO analysis would be considered out of order, effectively sidelining them. However, the rules package went on to list a specific exception to this requirement, including repealing or reforming the Affordable Care Act or a portion of the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010. These were the two legislative vehicles that were used to enact President Barack Obama’s signature health care law. What the provision actually means But while Ellison tweeted that the package "bars CBO from counting spikes in deficit spending spurred by an ACA repeal," it actually doesn’t say CBO can’t analyze the law’s costs. Rather, the provision in the rules package lifts the requirement that CBO track the cost of repeal or reform over the unusually long period mandated by the rules provision -- that is, 50 years after the first year CBO measures. Analyses over more typical -- and shorter -- time periods are not barred. "People have misinterpreted this exemption to conclude that CBO wouldn't provide a cost estimate for ACA legislation at all," said Ed Lorenzen, a senior advisor to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and a former senior aide to House Democratic Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland. "But the exemption only applies to the new requirement for additional information regarding long-term costs in CBO estimates of legislation." The Congressional Budget Act requires a cost estimate covering the next 10 years for all legislation considered by Congress, he said, and "the rules package doesn’t change that." Lorenzen added that the rules package doesn’t prevent CBO from making a long-term analysis of the costs of an ACA repeal — it just says that doing such an analysis isn’t mandatory. "There’s obviously a difference between saying something is not required and actually prohibiting it," Lorenzen said. "There’s reason to believe that CBO would probably provide information about a ballpark estimate of budgetary effects of legislation related to the Affordable Care Act beyond the 10-ten year window even without a requirement to do so, given the magnitude of the impact and interest among members of Congress in the long term budgetary effects of the ACA." Lorenzen said that he and his organization would have opposed a provision of the type Ellison assumes in his tweet. "But that’s not what’s happening here," he said. Donald Wolfensberger, a former House Rules Committee aide who is now a scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center, agreed with Lorenzen’s analysis. "This is a new point of order and exemption from it, and implicitly does not alter existing budget rules and requirements, including the ability of CBO to make cost estimates," Wolfensberger said. Ellison’s office backed off after PolitiFact relayed Lorenzen’s analysis and acknowledged that the interpretation in the tweet was incorrect. Our ruling Ellison tweeted that the "House GOP rules package bars CBO from counting spikes in deficit spending spurred by an ACA repeal." In reality, the rules package doesn’t bar CBO analysis of ACA repeal proposals. Rather, the rules package says that CBO is not required to conduct an extra-long-term analysis that goes 50 years into the future, although the office could do one if it wants. It also doesn’t prevent CBO from doing the more typical, 10-year analyses it does for proposed bills. We rate the statement False.

pomt-14005	The 2015 Legislature "passed the fewest laws in 20 years."	true	/texas/statements/2016/jun/03/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-says-texas-legislators-last-year-passe/	Texas Gov. Greg Abbott recently celebrated the 2015 Texas legislative session, which ended last June, as the "most conservative ever." Abbott, rousing delegates to the Republican Party of Texas convention in Dallas, said in his May 2016 address: "As just one example, we passed the fewest laws in 20 years, proving that better government doesn’t have to be more government." Setting aside what this proves or not, we wondered if indeed the 2015 Legislature approved the fewest pieces of legislation since 1995, 10 regular biennial sessions before. This didn’t take long to confirm; the Texas Legislative Reference Library presents relevant bill statistics for every regular and special session since 1879. And according to the library’s compilation, the 1,280 Texas House and Senate bills that made it into law in 2015 were the fewest since 1,063 measures made it into law in 1995, the first year of Republican George W. Bush’s tenure. Over the two decades, the next-lowest count of bills passed into law was 1,334 in 2003, followed by 1,354 in 2011 and 1,369 in 2005, according to the library. A few earlier sessions had low law counts (though, of course, Abbott’s claim didn’t reach to these years). Those 140-day sessions occurred in 1983 (1,092 bills-into-law); 1985 (979 bills-into-law); 1989 (1,264 bills-into-law); 1991 (924 bills-into-law); and 1993 (1,050 bills-into-law), according to the library. For this check, we didn’t count other indicators of legislative activity such as proposed constitutional amendments, which lawmakers place before voters (without a governor’s say). Our ruling Abbott said the 2015 Legislature "passed the fewest laws in 20 years." So it did, making this statement True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

pomt-06033	Mitt Romney is worth "at least a quarter billion dollars" and the bulk of his wealth "remains in blind trusts and overseas bank accounts."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/13/winning-our-future/king-bain-video-accuses-romney-hiding-his-fortune/	UPDATE: After Mitt Romney released his tax returns for 2010 and 2011, new evidence surfaced of his foreign bank accounts. We are adding that information to this report. Despite the new evidence, it still accounts for a small part of Romney's fortune, so our rating is unchanged. The King of Bain documentary tells viewers, again and again, that Mitt Romney is a very wealthy man. The video, released by a super PAC backing Newt Gingrich, flashes dollar signs and suitcases full of cash, along with images of Wall Street landmarks, to hammer home its Romney-as-corporate-raider message. Here, we’re looking into the film’s claim’s about Romney’s personal worth. At the end of the 28-minute film, white letters flash on a black background as somber piano music plays. "Romney’s own financial statement shows his personal fortune to be at least a quarter billion dollars." "No one knows for sure..." "The bulk of Mitt Romney’s personal wealth remains in blind trusts and overseas bank accounts." What we found is that some, but not all, of what’s in those statements is accurate. The size of his fortune Last year, Romney filed a financial disclosure Form 278 with the Office of Government Ethics, as required by all presidential candidates. It’s 28 pages long, listing bank accounts, mutual funds, stock holdings, speaker’s fees and more. That form only requires filers to select a range, for example between $100,001 and $250,000, for the value of each asset. King of Bain cites a Washington Post story that said the top end of the range of Romney’s wealth is $264 million. The low end is $85 million. In that same story, the Romney campaign told the Post that "a more accurate range" is between $190 million to $250 million. So the King of Bain narrator’s statement that Romney is now worth "somewhere over a quarter of a billion dollars" goes right for the high end of the range cited by the Washington Post. But the actual amount could be considerably less. Blind trusts and offshore accounts Romney’s disclosure form includes an attachment addressing the blind trust issue. It states: "Other than assets and income sources listed on page 1 of Schedule A, all of the assets listed in this Report are held by the W. Mitt Romney Blind Trust, the Ann D. Romney Blind Trust, Mr. Romney's IRA or Mrs. Romney's IRA (collectively, the 'Reporting Entities'). In each case, R. Bradford Malt, as Trustee (the 'Trustee'), has complete investment discretion over the assets held by these investment vehicles, except where the Trustee has delegated that discretion to third-party investment managers. "The management of the assets of the Reporting Entities was deemed blind by the Massachusetts State Ethics Commission. Since January 1, 2003, neither Mr. Romney nor Mrs. Romney has had any control over any of the assets acquired or disposed of by the Reporting Entities and neither Mr. Romney nor Mrs. Romney has previously received any reports identifying specific assets currently held by any of the Reporting Entities." Politicians commonly put their money in blind trusts while they hold office to prevent conflicts of interest. If they don’t know what investments they own, they can’t pass laws benefiting themselves, the theory goes. Bill Allison, editorial director for the Sunlight Foundation, which advocates for openness in government, said that even though the rules aim to prevent self-dealing, they aren’t airtight. "I think a lot of times politicians with blind trusts do have a pretty good idea what they own," he said. News stories have raised questions about the "blindness" of Romney’s trust. Still, the intent of blind trusts is to avoid conflicts of interest. So the video is correct in stating that much of Romney’s wealth is in a blind trust -- all but about $1.5 million, according to the form. But what about offshore accounts? We asked Winning Our Future to provide us with support for that claim but didn't receive any. The evidence emerged when Romney released two years of his personal tax returns in January 2012. The documents showed he previously had a Swiss bank account -- $3 million that a trust in his wife’s name reported holding in a Swiss money-market account, according to a story in the New York Times. Malt, the trustee, told reporters that he had opened the account with the United Bank of Switzerland in 2003 and closed it in 2010. The Times said the interest it accrued in 2010, about $1,700, was reported on tax documents. Malt told reporters the account was opened ''for diversification.'' ''It is a bank account, nothing more, nothing less,'' he said, according to the Times. The tax returns also revealed investments in low-tax locales including the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, Ireland and Luxembourg. But it’s impossible to tell how much of Romney’s fortune comes from his holdings in offshore funds and institutions, according to numerous news reports. "You really can’t determine where his wealth is from tax returns because they’re just reporting income," Allison said. Allison inspected Romney’s returns and noted that on his 2010 return, Romney reported $2.7 million in gross foreign income. That’s out of $27.3 million in total gross income. "The thing that jumped out at me is that his foreign income is just a fraction of his total," Allison said. He added that it’s possible that Romney has other foreign assets not reported on the tax return because they aren’t producing income. Romney’s financial disclosure form lists other investments held by firms in Europe, including PNB Paribas, in France, and Rabobank Nederland, which is Dutch. But that type of investment isn't different from holdings in many people's 401(k) retirement savings funds. Allison said that based on publicly available records, foreign assets and income do not "appear to be the bulk of his wealth." "But the forms that we’re looking at really aren’t designed to answer these kind of questions," Allison added. "And that’s the problem with the disclosures we require of our presidential candidates." Our ruling Winning Our Future’s movie puts Romney’s personal fortune at $250 million and says most of it "remains in blind trusts and overseas bank accounts." According to one analysis of Romney’s financial disclosure, his wealth may total $264 million -- but it may also be closer to $85 million. It’s clear that most of it has been held in blind trusts since 2003, which is common practice among elected officials to avoid conflicts of interest. But the super PAC didn't provide, and we didn't find, good evidence that "the bulk" of Romney’s money is in overseas accounts.

pomt-13712	Says Donald Trump promised "the mass deportation of Latino families."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/28/karen-bass/mass-deportation-latino-families/	U.S. Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif., said Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has achieved one thing in the Democrats’ favor: He has united them with divisive policies. "Donald Trump, when you take pride in your outright ignorance of world affairs, when you promise the mass deportation of Latino families, when you dismiss officer-involved shootings of African-Americans, when you degrade women, Donald Trump, you unite us," Bass said on the third night of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. That prompted us to revisit Trump’s comments about immigrants and deportations. Bass said Trump has promised to deport Latino families, but only characterizing those families as "Latino" misses an important distinction in Trump’s plans. Trump has promised to deport undocumented immigrants. Not all Latinos in the country are undocumented, and not all undocumented immigrants are Latino. That said, the majority of undocumented immigrants are from Latin American countries. Pew Research Center’s most recent estimates pegged the number of unauthorized immigrants in the nation at 11.3 million, or about 3.5 percent of the U.S. population. Mexicans account for about half of the unauthorized population, according to Pew. So what exactly has Trump said about mass deportations? Earlier on in his campaign, Trump said he would round up "in a very humane way" the millions of undocumented immigrants in the country and send them back to their native countries. In an interview that aired in September 2015 on CBS’ 60 Minutes, Scott Pelley pressed Trump about what he would do with the population. Pelley: "Eleven, 12 million illegal immigrants --" Trump: "Or whatever the number is." Pelley: "Still in the country, what do you do?" Trump: "If they've done well, they're going out and they're coming back in legally. Because you said it--" Pelley: "You're rounding them all up?" Trump: "We're rounding 'em up in a very humane way, in a very nice way. And they're going to be happy because they want to be legalized. And, by the way, I know it doesn't sound nice. But not everything is nice." Trump has also discussed having a "deportation force" to remove undocumented immigrants from the country, though he’s also said he would let some come back legally. Trump stuck to the deportation plan for all undocumented immigrants in some of the GOP primary debates. During the CNN/Telemundo debate on Feb. 25, 2016, host Wolf Blitzer asked about his deportation force idea and whether his plan to let "good ones" back in amounted to amnesty. Trump said "we either have a country, or we don’t have a country." "We have at least 11 million people in this country that came in illegally," he continued. "They will go out. They will come back -- some will come back, the best, through a process. They have to come back legally. They have to come back through a process, and it may not be a very quick process, but I think that's very fair, and very fine. They're going to get in line with other people." In March, Fox host Megyn Kelly asked Trump whether he told the New York Times editorial board in an off-the-record interview that he was "flexible" on his deportation plan. Trump said, "Not very flexible. No, not very flexible. ... But there's always give and take. ... But we need give and take in government. If you don't have give and take, you're never going to agree on anything." Change of heart? So Trump clearly has said he would seek to remove the 11 million or more undocumented immigrants. But he also has suggested he may be softening that position, without offering specifics. On a recent trip to Scotland, Trump said President Barack Obama "has mass deported vast numbers of people -- the most ever" and that Trump would have "not only the best policies, but I will have the biggest heart of anybody," Bloomberg Politics reported June 25. He said he would not label his approach "mass deportations." "No, I would not call it mass deportations," Trump told Bloomberg Politics. He said he would "get rid of a lot of bad dudes who are here." Trump’s campaign website contains no mention of deporting the entire undocumented population. Instead it focuses on the mandatory return of criminal aliens and nationwide use of the E-verify system, among other policies. Our ruling Bass said Trump has "promised mass deportation of Latino families." Off the bat, Bass’ attack is imprecise. She said Trump wants to deport Latino families, when he has not promised that exactly. He pledged to remove the undocumented population, which is certainly comprised of Latinos but is not exclusive to them. (And obviously, not all Latinos in the United States are here illegally.) The underlying issue is tough talk Trump offered earlier in his campaign about rounding up undocumented immigrants in the country and sending them back to their native countries — with the "good ones" able to come back, possibly. Trump reiterated that stance several times as journalists asked how it would work. But the Republican presidential nominee appears to have recently softened his view over the last month, and his official immigration plans don’t mention deporting undocumented families en masse. We rate Bass’ statement Half True.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/568ac30a-79bf-4015-a2c1-0301adb3788e	None	Karen Bass	None	None	None	2016-07-28T01:39:57	2016-07-27	['None']
pomt-09131	"BP is setting up claims offices throughout the state."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/jun/15/charlie-crist/bp-bringing-claims-centers-florida-charlie-crist-s/	Among the Gulf state governors, Florida Gov. Charlie Crist has been the most supportive, or maybe least critical, of the federal government's response to the Deepwater Horizon oil explosion. But that hasn't stopped him from tossing some jabs at perhaps an easier target -- BP. In an interview with CNN's Candy Crowley, Crist echoed comments by Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink that some Florida businesses are on the verge of bankruptcy because of BP's slow processing of claims. "We are demanding that they do better," Crist said on June 6, 2010. "And what I mean by that is that the attorney general, Bill McCollum, and I have asked former attorneys general Bob Butterworth and Jim Smith to set up a task force of lawyers in order to be prepared for additional compensation when that becomes necessary. And we are pretty certain that it will. We have some of the best attorneys in the country here in Florida. And they have dealt with issues like this in the past, some other maritime issues that we have had to be faced with. So we are putting that together. "But in the near term -- in the short-term, if you will, we want these claims to be responded to much more quickly. BP is setting up claims offices throughout the state. But we want them to answer those claims more rapidly, because these people need help. And we have to be there to try to make them as whole as we can during this very difficult process. There are a lot of businesses impacted by it. It is not just restaurateurs and the hoteliers, it's fishermen, it's oyster fishermen and a lot of people along the coast who really depend on the Gulf of Mexico for their very livelihood." With the oil spill continuing to threaten Florida, we wanted to check Crist's statement about the claims process, specifically if BP has set up offices throughout Florida. Under federal law, BP is obligated to pay for the cost to clean up the spill. But its liability is limited to $75 million when it comes to paying economic damage claims from businesses and people affected by the spill. BP has said it will pay all "legitimate" claims, even those beyond the $75 million cap, and some Democrats in Congress are considering whether to lift the $75 million cap and apply it to BP retroactively. BP has organized an extensive process to manage economic damage claims. The company announced on June 15 that it has paid out $16 million to businesses that have filed claims in excess of $5,000, and already issued 25,000 claims checks totalling $63 million. By June 20, BP says it will have paid out $85 million. Claims are coming in through BP's website, www.bp.com/claims and through a 1-800 number, company officials say. As Crist suggested, BP also has set up 25 claims centers scattered around the affected areas. There are 10 claims centers in Florida, more than any other state (Louisiana has seven, Alabama has five and Mississippi has three). Eight of the 10 Florida claims centers are clustered in the Panhandle, between Escambia County and Wakulla counties. The other two centers are in the Florida Keys in Key West and Marathon. You can see a complete list here. (If you're considering filing a claim in person, BP asks that you first get a claim number by calling 1-800-440-0858.) Crist said "BP is setting up claims offices throughout the state," to help process economic damage claims from businesses and people affected by the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion. BP has opened 10 claims centers in Florida, more than in any other state. Crist's use of the word "throughout," kind of has us stumbling a bit. The claims centers are concentrated primarily in the Panhandle, with two others in the Florida Keys. There are no centers between Cedar Key and Naples on the west coast of the state and none on the east coast. While it is true that reports of oil have been concentrated to the Panhandle and the Keys, the spill has the potential to impact all parts of the state, regardless how close the oil is to the shore. Trying to balance it all out, we rate Crist's statement Mostly True.	None	Charlie Crist	None	None	None	2010-06-15T15:25:41	2010-06-06	['None']
pomt-06473	The health care law was "a 2,733-page bill! . . . No amendments!"	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/18/joe-pitts/pitts-healthcare-long-no-amendments/	Continuing their battle against the health care overhaul, a group of Republican congressmen held a press conference on Oct. 5, 2011, outside the Capitol, waving a petition they say was signed by 1.6 million Americans calling for a repeal of the law. The Washington Post’s Dana Milbank, in an Oct. 6 column, criticized the Republicans for dithering about the past rather than enacting job-creating legislation that could better position their party to take back the White House next November. Milbank plucked verbal nuggets from several GOP lawmakers, concluding with a truncated quote from Rep. Joe Pitts of Pennsylvania. "Monstrous!" contributed Rep. Joe Pitts (Pa.). "This was a 2,733-page bill! . . . No amendments! . . . Partisan vote!" The entire quote, which we found in a transcript of the press conference, goes like this: "This was a 2,733-page bill that went directly from Harry Reid's desk to the Senate floor, bypassed Senate committee, no amendments, passed on a partisan vote, directly from the Senate floor to the House floor, bypass the committees, no amendments, passed on a partisan vote, without one member having read this bill." A lot of claims are packed into that one sentence, but we thought we’d dig into just a couple of them. One, is the bill really that long? And two, were there no amendments at all during its long road to passage? The page count We asked Pitts’ office where the 2,733 came from, and his spokesman said Pitts was referring to "how long the bill was the week it was considered in the House." According to the Library of Congress, which catalogs all versions of the different bills, the one that passed the Senate in December 2009 numbers 2,409 pages. The following March, the House passed the same bill and both chambers passed a reconciliation bill that modified the law (and appeased Democrats in the House). It numbers 55 pages. Added up, the total is 2,464. Pitts’ spokesman acknowledged that the law is shorter now, but said "if you go back to March 2010, you can find a number of contemporary references to the bill as numbering 2,700 pages." We looked at other versions of the bill but could not find any that had that number. Still, while Pitts is off slightly because of different versions and how the document is broken into pages, his underlying point is right: It was a very long bill. No amendments? Whether the bill had no amendments is a much trickier claim. If you remember your Civics 101 class (and Schoolhouse Rock), you might recall how a bill becomes law: Usually, the House and Senate pass different versions of a bill, then they work out their differences in a conference committee. A unified bill comes out of that committee, and both bodies vote again on the new bill. Then the president signs it. For the health care bill, back in 2009, the House and Senate had each passed different versions. It was widely expected the two bills would be stitched together in conference committee, then voted on again. But before that could happen, the Democrats lost their 60-seat, filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. (Republican Scott Brown in January 2010 won the seat formerly held by the late Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.) Anything that came out of conference committee at that point could have been held up in the Senate, blocked by 40 Republican senators. Democrats decided to get around this by having the House simply accept the Senate’s version of the bill. Obama signed that version into law. Then the Democrats used a different measure -- a reconciliation bill, which requires only a simple majority -- to modify the law they had passed. The House version of the bill -- the one that never made it to conference committee -- did have amendments, particularly as it was considered by committees. In fact, Pitts himself offered one of them, a provision restricting abortion coverage. (It was better known as the Stupak amendment because it was co-sponsored by Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich.) Several Senate versions of the bill also had amendments. But Pitts is right that the Senate version -- the one voted on in December that became the basis of the new law -- did not have amendments. This is because Sen. Harry Reid, the Democratic leader, decided to create a new version of the bill in the form of a manager’s amendment. At that point in the process, negotiations with Senate Republicans had gone on for months, and it seemed very likely that none of the Republicans were going to support the Senate bill, with amendments or not. We should note that President Barack Obama claimed back in September 2009 that legislation in the works was bipartisan. At the time, we rated his characterization Barely True. (It would now be called Mostly False.) The two parties were never very close together on what a new health care law should include. Our ruling Pitts said, "This was a 2,733-page bill that went directly from Harry Reid's desk to the Senate floor, bypassed Senate committee, no amendments, passed on a partisan vote, directly from the Senate floor to the House floor, bypass the committees, no amendments, passed on a partisan vote, without one member having read this bill." As far as the number of pages go, Pitts is largely correct. If we’re going to put an official page count on the bill, we would put it at 2,464, but we recognize that the bill had several different versions as it was on its way to becoming a law. As for "no amendments," Pitts is right as it related to the floor passage of the Senate bill. There were no amendments to the bill that passed. But that’s like describing only the last two minutes of a football game. What about the other 58? The health care bill began in committee in both chambers of Congress, as virtually all bills do. There was ample opportunity to amend it, and the bill was in fact amended by both Democrats and Republicans, if only mostly on technicalities by the party opposed to it. But Pitts made a blanket statement that there were "no amendments," without taking the earlier part of the process into account. Given all that, we rate the claim Half True.

pomt-05869	"Statistics bear out that any time a country, a state, makes more restrictive abortion laws ... fatalities go up and abortions actually increase."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2012/feb/10/nickie-antonio/nickie-antonio-says-restrictive-abortion-laws-actu/	While GOP lawmakers focused their energy last year on abortion legislation, some have fought those laws with similar conviction. Rep. Nickie Antonio, a freshman lawmaker from Lakewood, has been among the steady voices in opposition to Republicans’ anti-abortion efforts. Antonio recently attempted to contrast the GOP’s agenda with a resolution to designate a week in January as "Reproductive Rights Awareness Week." The aim of the resolution is to promote public awareness and support "reproductive rights and justice." During a Jan. 24 news conference to announce the resolution, Antonio talked about the dangers associated with restrictive abortion laws. "Statistics bear out that any time a country, a state, makes more restrictive abortion laws — restricts women’s access to comprehensive reproductive health care — fatalities go up and abortions actually increase," Antonio said. Abortion is an emotional issue that has been a persistent topic of discussion as Ohio lawmakers have considered several abortion-related bills for the last year-plus. Antonio’s statement raised PolitiFact Ohio’s curiosity because she was suggesting that the anti-abortion bills Ohio Republicans have supported would actually cause an increase in abortions. Since the beginning of last year, Republican lawmakers who control the Senate and the House of Representatives have approved a late-term abortion ban and legislation that makes it more difficult for minors to obtain abortions without their parents’ permission. The late-term ban prohibits abortions when a pregnancy is 20 weeks along unless a doctor determines a fetus cannot live outside the womb — a condition known as viability. The House of Representatives also has approved a controversial "heartbeat bill" which would ban abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detected. The Senate has not yet voted on the measure. PolitiFact Ohio contacted Antonio’s office for evidence to back up her claim. Her staff cited a recent study published Jan. 19 in The Lancet, a British medical journal published since 1823. The study, "Induced abortion: incidence and trends worldwide from 1995 to 2008," examined abortion rates and the corresponding abortion laws on a country-by-country basis. The study, authored by Gilda Sedgh of the Guttmacher Institute in New York, addressed international abortion laws and, to an extent, fatalities related to abortion. It concluded that restrictive abortion laws did not coincide with lower abortion rates; that rates were higher in regions of the world where abortion is illegal. The study’s findings do not connect restrictive abortion laws to fewer abortions. But neither does the study show that these laws lead to more abortions, as Antonio claimed. Sedgh said in an e-mail that the Lancet study did not establish a cause-and-effect relationship between restrictive abortion laws and abortions. She said lower abortion rates in countries with liberal abortion laws could be attributed to easier access to affordable contraception. "In other words, the abortion laws don’t cause the abortion rates," she wrote in an e-mail. "The abortion laws appear to be irrelevant when it comes to what women do in the face of an unintended pregnancy." Regarding fatalities, the study said nations with more liberal abortion laws tend to see fewer health consequences from unsafe abortion. It cited a drop in abortion mortality in South Africa when its law was liberalized, and in Nepal after the country made abortion legal on broad grounds. The Lancet study did not examine abortion laws of individual states. In fact, one of the study’s authors said Ohio would still be considered to have "liberal" abortion laws if it passed the controversial heartbeat bill. "So, even if that legislation were passed, Ohio would be classified as having a liberal abortion law. The gestational limit would however, be somewhat severe compared to those in other countries with liberal laws," Sedgh wrote in an e-mail. PolitiFact Ohio checked further with advocates on both sides of the abortion issue for guidance about the impact of states’ abortion laws. Michael Gonidakis, executive director of Ohio Right to Life, said Antonio’s claim is baseless because Ohio’s abortion rate has been declining for the last 10 years. The Ohio Department of Health’s most recent annual report on abortions confirms the number of abortions has declined each year from 2001 (37,464) to 2010 (28,123). Gonidakis’ point, however, does not directly address Antonio’s claim because the statistics he cited predate the anti-abortion laws, passed last year, that have driven the current abortion debate in Columbus. Jaime Miracle, the policy director for NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio, said she knows of no studies that examined states’ abortion laws and their corresponding abortion rates. "The problem is there really isn’t domestic research on that," she said. Miracle, who attended the Jan. 24 news conference with Antonio, said The Lancet study and others support Antonio’s general claim – that restricting access to abortion and reproductive health care does not reduce incidents of abortion. But that does not mean those restrictive laws increase abortion rates, and we did not find research that reached such a conclusion. Miracle provided us with a copy of a study by Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good. The 2008 study looked at the effect of socioeconomic factors on abortion. "There is little evidence that state policies restricting access to abortion (such as enforced informed and parental consent laws and partial birth abortion legislation affect the abortion rate," the study said. So where does that leave Antonio’s claim that when abortion restrictions are enacted, fatalities go up and abortions actually increase? Her statement contains an element of truth. The study her staff cited from The Lancet did find that restrictive abortion laws did not coincide with lower abortion rates and that rates tended to be higher in countries where abortion is illegal. Regarding fatalities, the study noted that abortion mortality in one country, South Africa, dropped as the country’s abortion laws became less restrictive. In Nepal, abortion mortality fell as abortion became legal. But the study did not specifically say that more restrictive laws drive up abortion rates and fatalities, as Antonio claimed. One of the study’s authors, in fact, specifically said the study did not establish that cause-and-effect relationship and that other factors were in play. Nor did the study look at abortion rates and fatalities for individual states -- something Antonio mentioned in her statement. Those are critical facts that would give a different impression. On the Truth-O-Meter, Antonio’s claim rates Mostly False.	None	Nickie Antonio	None	None	None	2012-02-10T06:00:00	2012-01-24	['None']
pomt-13474	Barack Obama has "doubled our national debt. Doubled it. It's going to be close to $20 trillion when he leaves."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2016/sep/12/donald-trump/trump-solely-blames-obama-doubling-debt/	Donald Trump says this White House is leaving behind a lot of red ink. "Barack Obama has doubled, during his fairly short period of years, he’s doubled our national debt. Doubled it. It’s going to be close to $20 trillion when he leaves," Trump told supporters at a Sept. 6 rally in Virginia Beach. Did Obama double the national debt? We checked. The Trump campaign’s press office justified his statement by sending us a link to U.S. Treasury Department figures on the size of the national debt. On Jan. 20, 2009, the day Obama took office, the total national debt stood at $10.6 trillion. On Sept. 6, the day Trump made his statement, it was $19.5 trillion. Over the past year the debt has grown by more than $1 trillion, so Trump’s estimate that the debt will be "close to $20 trillion" by the time Obama’s term ends in January is reasonable and is close to doubling the amount from when the president entered office. These indebtedness figures take into account all obligations, including about $5.4 trillion in intergovernmental debt that the U.S. government owes itself, such as the Social Security and Medicare trust funds that are invested in Treasury securities. When looking at the size of the U.S. debt, some experts prefer tallying just the amount of debt held by the public in Treasury bills, savings bonds and obligations to foreign governments, because that’s the debt the government owes to outside entities. But even by that measure, the debt has risen sharply. Public debt this month stands at $14.1 trillion, a figure that’s more than double the $6.3 trillion total when Obama took office. But Trump’s statement implies that Obama is solely to blame for the rise in the debt, and that misses a key part of the story. While Obama proposes spending and signs it into law, all of the spending bill first must pass Congress. In other words, the rise in the debt is not a solo act by Obama. Other factors beyond elected officials’ actions contributed to the debt increase. Robert Bixby, executive director of the centrist Concord Coalition, told our colleagues at PolitiFact Wisconsin in July that given the fact that Obama took office as the Great Recession sapped government revenues, the debt "would have exploded certainly during (Obama’s) first term, no matter who was president." Our ruling Trump said Obama "doubled the national debt. Doubled it. It’s going to be close to $20 trillion when he leaves." The figures are correct, and we don’t doubt the president shares some of the blame for the increased indebtedness. But Trump’s statement leaves out some key points. First of all, the added debt wasn’t solely the responsibility of Obama; Congress had to approve it as well. And the recession that began before Obama took office in 2009 cut government revenues and led to some of the higher debt incurred during the president’s term. We rate Trump’s claim Half True.

pomt-04568	Says "One of the state’s largest governments made charging this tax one of their top priorities just this year."	pants on fire!	/oregon/statements/2012/sep/25/Yes-on-79/did-city-portland-make-charging-real-estate-transf/	The chief backers of Ballot Measure 79 submitted a voters’ pamphlet statement this summer brimming with reasons to enshrine a ban on real estate transfer taxes in the Oregon Constitution. The tax is already prohibited in Oregon, with the exception of Washington County, but advocates want to make sure the state doesn’t implement a tax or allow local governments to impose one. The reasons put forth by the Oregon Association of Realtors basically boil down to this: Home prices are down, property taxes are high enough, and you don’t want another tax that would make it harder to buy or sell a home. The group also plants a bug of fear in tax haters with this: "Politicians have considered the idea of charging or allowing multiple layers of transfer taxes each and every legislative session for the last decade, and in fact one of the state’s largest governments made charging this tax one of their top priorities just this year." (our emphasis) Obviously, we wanted to know which large government made charging this tax a priority. Who was it and what happened? (Was it the tax-happy city of Portland?) We contacted the Realtors’ association and received a response from Jon Coney, spokesman for the Yes on 79 campaign, previously known as Protect Oregon Homes. It turns out the campaign was indeed talking about the city of Portland. As evidence that this large government body had "made charging this tax" a top priority this year, Coney shared a draft of the 2012 Legislative Agenda for the city of Portland. An agenda! We got a copy of the final agenda. One of seven items on it was to "strongly oppose any legislation that would preempt the City’s authority and support legislation that proposes to lift preemptions." Preemption, for those who don’t know, is when a superior government body regulates in a given area and pretty much trumps a lesser government’s ability to do the same. The state trumps cities, and the feds trump states. Cities and counties generally dislike preemption, because it usually ties their ability to raise revenue, also known as taxes and fees. Two particularly vexing subject areas -- taxing cigarettes and alcohol, and levying real estate transfer fees -- are indeed specified as examples in the city’s 2012 legislative agenda. That’s all accurate. But we asked Coney how supporting flexibility to be able to maybe one day pass a real estate transfer tax -- along with higher alcohol and cigarette taxes, if you follow the group’s reasoning -- is the same as making the imposition of such a tax a top priority this year? He said he didn’t want to get into a fight over semantics, but one leads to the other. "It’s pretty clear for us, in 2012, putting this on their legislative agenda clearly is a strong signal that they want to pursue this taxing mechanism," Coney said. Are the two acts one and the same? He said, "It is our position that asking that the (prohibition) be lifted is essentially leading to the institution of the real estate tax." So this is the evidence the campaign provides for making the claim that the city of Portland made charging this tax a top priority this year: A legislative agenda in which the tax is given as an example among several examples on one issue out of seven. And by the way, legislation wasn’t even drafted. And the Realtors know this. Maybe we missed talk of a real estate transfer tax somewhere? At a city council meeting at some point? Nope, the campaign can provide no other evidence. They can, however, point to previous legislative attempts, which got nowhere. "I don’t remember it being raised," said Nick Fish, the city commissioner in charge of housing. "It’s been on a laundry list of preemptions we object to on principle. Other than this campaign brought by Realtors, I don’t even remember a conversation about the real property tax in the last year or two." We asked Martha Pellegrino, lead lobbyist for the city of Portland, if the city would go ahead with a transfer tax if the prohibition were lifted. The answer is no, she said: "Just because the state repeals a preemption of local authority does not mean that the City, or any other local government, would automatically act." We’re certain some of you don’t care what Pellegrino or Fish -- or any other government official says -- they will or won’t do. And it’s absolutely accurate to say that Portland officials could levy a tax on every transfer of property as soon as the pesky state prohibition is gone. But the only evidence the campaign provides is a legislative agenda for a short legislative session in which no legislation was drafted. How does that translate into making "charging this tax one of their top priorities just this year?" It doesn’t. And that makes the statement both inaccurate and ridiculous.

pomt-14729	Says American polling shows Russian President Vladimir Putin has "an 80 percent approval rating."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/20/donald-trump/donald-trump-right-about-putins-popularity-russia/	Russian President Vladimir Putin recently called Donald Trump "brilliant" and "talented," and Trump wears those compliments as a badge of honor. On NBC’s Meet the Press on Dec. 20, host Chuck Todd asked the real estate mogul and Republican presidential front runner why he is so comfortable praising Putin, noting that Trump has called Putin a "strong leader." "He is a strong leader. What am I going to say, he’s a weak leader?" Trump responded. "He’s making mincemeat out of our president." Then Trump turned to his reliable measure of a person’s success: the polls. "He’s got an 80 percent approval rating done by pollsters from, I understand, this country. Okay?" Trump said. "So it’s not even done by his pollsters. He’s very popular within Russia; that may change." An 80 percent approval rating is pretty darn high. For comparison, President Barack Obama’s job approval rating is currently about 46 percent and peaked at 64 percent in February 2009, his second month in office, according to Pew Research Center. So we wondered if Trump is correct that American polling shows Putin has such a high rating among the Russian people. In a first for Trump on the Truth-O-Meter thus far, he is. By the numbers A November study written by four American researchers backs up Trump’s point, finding about 80 percent of Russians really support Putin. "What Trump said is consistent with what we found," said Scott Gehlbach, a co-author of the study and a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Given that Putin achieved strikingly high public approval ratings, the study asked whether Putin’s popularity is real or if respondents have been lying to pollsters. A primary concern for the researchers was the possibility of "social desirability bias," the idea that a person who does not support Putin might tell a pollster that they do support him out of fear of retaliation or going against social norms. To correct for this, the researchers used a list experiment, a technique used to broach sensitive issues because it does not require respondents to say explicitly that they do or do not support Putin. Pollsters gave Russian respondents a list of several Russian leaders and asked how many they support, but not which ones. By comparing the difference between a control group, which was presented with a list that did not include Putin, with a group that received a list that did include Putin, the researchers were able to estimate overall support for the Russian president. After conducting four list experiments in January and March of this year, Gehlbach and his co-authors concluded that the high level of support for Putin is real. If anything, their finding of 80 percent support might be an underestimate. Gehlbach noted, though, that the study did not account for how many of the 80 percent are devout supporters versus those whose support is fleeting. Further, it’s likely that the Kremlin manipulates public opinion of Putin through tight control of the media. "It’s reasonable that some people support Putin because of what they see on the evening news," Gehlbach said. This study is evidence that Putin is genuinely popular in Russia, wrote Joshua Tucker, a political science professor at New York University, in a Nov. 24 post on the Washington Post’s Monkey Cage blog. In sum, "the findings suggest both that the West will likely be dealing with a popular leader when it interacts with Putin in the days to come," Tucker wrote. One potential wrinkle in Trump’s claim is that while the American researchers designed the study, a Russian polling company, the Levada Center, actually conducted the survey. But Gehlbach said that doesn’t dilute Trump’s claim because the Levada Center is well-regarded as independent from the Russian government. Karlyn Bowman, a public opinion expert and senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, also said the Levada Center is held in high regard and its findings are consistent with related research by the U.S.-based Pew Research Center. This past summer, Pew found 88 percent of Russians "have confidence in (Putin), to do the right thing regarding world affairs." Putin’s standing is substantially lower among Americans, with just 21 percent saying they have confidence in him. Gehlbach’s article, which will be published in the journal Post-Soviet Affairs, also mentions how Putin’s high approval ratings are often confirmed by Western researchers’ polls. The study cites an Associated Press-NORC at the University of Chicago poll that found Putin’s approval rating to be about 81 percent in 2014. Our ruling Trump said American polling shows Russian President Vladimir Putin has "an 80 percent approval rating." Multiple American polls have found Putin’s approval rating to hover around 80 percent among the Russian public, including a recent study that aimed to adjust for any possibility that respondents have been lying to pollsters out of fear or social expectations.

pomt-13360	Says Tom Nelson "backed higher taxes on Social Security, costing Wisconsin seniors $95 million."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/sep/30/mike-gallagher/house-race-mike-gallaghers-false-claim-about-tom-n/	The competitive race for an open congressional seat in the Green Bay area has been marked by attack ads on Social Security. Democrat Tom Nelson and Republican Mike Gallagher are vying in the Nov. 8, 2016 election to succeed Reid Ribble, a Republican who decided not to run for a fourth term. The Rothenburg and Gonzales Political Report, as well as the Cook Report, both recently shifted the race from "toss up" to "leans Republican." On Sept. 1, 2016, Nelson, the Outagamie County executive, released a TV ad accusing Gallagher of having a plan that would "cut Social Security benefits for two-thirds of seniors." Our rating was Half True. Gallagher, a former U.S. Marine and former congressional aide, has not made such a proposal. However, he has praised a proposal that would make those cuts, saying he is most influenced on Social Security by the proposal’s author. On Sept. 12, 2016, it was Gallagher’s turn. He released a TV ad accusing Nelson of having "backed higher taxes on Social Security, costing Wisconsin seniors $95 million." Let’s see how this one rates. 2005 votes Gallagher points to a vote that Nelson, then a member of the Wisconsin Assembly, took on the 2005-’07 state budget -- a 394-page document with thousands of figures and provisions. One provision in the budget, which was adopted by the Republican-controlled Legislature and signed by Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, eliminated state income taxes on Social Security benefits. So, despite Gallagher’s claim, there was not a proposal for higher taxes on Social Security. But eliminating the tax did save Wisconsin Social Security recipients an estimated $99.7 million per year, roughly what Gallagher claimed, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. Nelson voted against the budget. But does that mean he voted against the Social Security provision it contained? When voting on something as huge as a state budget, a lawmaker could vote no for any number of reasons having to do with spending, policies or other factors. In other words, a no vote on the overall budget doesn’t mean a lawmaker opposed every single provision, or even any particular provision. Nelson has said he voted no because the budget reduced funding for education. The budget didn’t actually reduce funding for public schools. It added $458 million over the two-year period. But the amount was less than half of the $938 million increase advocated by Doyle, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported at the time. There’s one more point -- a significant one. Nelson voted for an amendment that added the repeal of the tax on Social Security benefits to the budget. So, he was for the repeal, even though he voted against the overall state budget that ultimately accomplished the repeal. Gallagher’s campaign called it a "show" vote. But unlike the budget, it was an up-or-down vote on a single provision and, as such, gives a clearer idea of his position. Our rating Gallagher says Nelson "backed higher taxes on Social Security, costing Wisconsin seniors $95 million." Nelson voted against the 2005-’07 state budget, which ended the state income tax on Social Security benefits, saving seniors more than $95 million per year. But that’s not the same as backing higher taxes on Social Security, something that was not even on the table. And a vote against the overall state budget doesn’t mean Nelson opposed eliminating the tax on Social Security benefits. Indeed, he voted for the amendment that added that provision to the budget.

pomt-14402	Says Hillary Clinton told the Des Moines Register on Aug. 8, 2015: "I will get the NRA shut down for good if I become president. If we can ban handguns, we will do it."	pants on fire!	/iowa/statements/2016/mar/14/viral-image/viral-photo-fabricates-hillary-clinton-quote-guns/	Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton explicitly stated her plans to "shut down" the National Rifle Association and expressed hope at banning handguns in an interview with The Des Moines Register last summer. At least, that’s according to a viral image that first cropped up on an anti-Clinton Tumblr blog and has been shared widely on Facebook. "I will get the NRA shut down for good if I become president. If we can ban handguns, we will do it," the post quotes Clinton as telling the Register on Aug. 8, 2015. But here’s the thing: The quote is wholly fabricated. Clinton was never quoted in the Register making that statement, and it appears she has not made such a statement anywhere else. Clinton campaigned heavily in Iowa throughout the summer and fall of 2015, and Register reporters and the paper’s editorial board interviewed her several times. But she was not in Iowa on Aug. 8, when she allegedly made the statement. Clinton’s first visit to Iowa in the month of August occurred on Aug. 14, followed by public events on Aug. 15 and Aug. 26. A review of the Register’s archives show Clinton was neither interviewed nor quoted directly on Aug. 8 or in the days immediately following. Clinton did make several statements regarding gun control on the Iowa campaign trail that were covered by the Register. In all of them, she laid out an agenda that calls for broader background-check requirements, including sales at gun shows, as well as stronger measures to prevent gun purchases by domestic abusers and people with serious mental health problems. "I'm going to speak out against the uncontrollable use of guns in our country because I believe we can do better than that," Clinton said in Iowa in July. "A majority of Americans and a majority of gun owners agree with universal background checks to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers and people who are mentally unstable and even terrorists." On Aug. 26 in Ankeny, she responded to the on-air murders of a news crew in Virginia: "We've got to do something. It's a very difficult political issue. But we are smart enough, compassionate enough to balance legitimate Second Amendment rights concerns with preventive measures and control measures, so whatever motivated this murderer ... we will not see more needless, senseless deaths," she said. She went on, "If guns weren't so readily available, if we had universal background checks, if we could put some time out between the person who got fired, or domestic abuse, or whatever other motivation ... maybe we could prevent this kind of carnage." On Oct. 6, she described her views again, in response to a mass shooting in Oregon: "I feel like this is unfinished business in our country, and I am very determined that we are going to try to bring some sanity back, so that people's Second Amendment rights are protected — but they are not absolute, the way the NRA wants them to be," Clinton said at an event in Davenport. "There are common-sense ways to make sure people are not using guns to commit mass murders." Gun control came up again at an event in Sioux City on Dec. 4, after the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. At that time, she expressed support for banning gun sales to people on federal "no-fly" lists. "I think we've got to be more willing to start imposing these kinds of gun-safety measures," Clinton said. "I'm certainly going to continue advocating for them." Internet searches for the quote found on the image refer only to the image itself — not to any original reporting from the Des Moines Register, another news outlet or to raw audio or video. Evidence of the quote does not appear to exist beyond what was originally posted on Tumblr. Our ruling A post spread via social media quotes Clinton as telling The Des Moines Register, "I will get the NRA shut down for good if I become president. If we can ban handguns, we will do it." Clinton was quoted in The Des Moines Register several times about gun control in the months leading up to the Iowa caucuses, but she did not say what the post accuses her of saying. Clinton has not advocated for shutting down the NRA or banning handguns outright. The claim is entirely fabricated. We rate this statement Pants on Fire!

pomt-05741	Mitt Romney "left Massachusetts $1 billion in debt."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/02/red-white-and-blue-fund/ad-accuses-mitt-romney-leaving-massachusetts-1-bil/	An ad sponsored by the Red White and Blue Fund -- a pro-Rick Santorum super PAC -- attacks former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney over his record of fiscal stewardship while in office. The ad says that Romney "left Massachusetts $1 billion in debt." We decided to see if that was accurate. In the ad, the Red White and Blue Fund cites three articles that were included in an opposition-research document attributed to the campaign of Arizona Sen. John McCain, who faced Romney in the Republican presidential primary four years earlier. One of the articles ran in the Boston Globe on Dec. 30, 2006, during the transition period between the governorships of Romney, who didn’t seek reelection, and his successor, Democrat Deval Patrick. The Globe reported that aides to Patrick said the state "is facing a deficit that could reach $1 billion next year, a looming budget gap that observers say could force Patrick to scale back his ambitious agenda, slash spending, or raise taxes." The Globe reported that in a Nov. 27, 2006, briefing to Patrick, Romney aides projected a budget deficit of between $400 million and $1.1 billion for fiscal 2008, which was to begin in July 2007, six months into Patrick’s term. The total state budget at the time was $26 billion. So the ad has some justification for using the $1 billion figure. But based on our discussions with budget experts in the state, we find the ad ignores important details: • The number in question was a projection of a possible future budget deficit. It was an estimate, based on a snapshot of economic data, of what might happen, and it was offered to allow Patrick to figure out how to balance the budget for a fiscal year beginning more than six months later. It was not a final scorecard on Romney’s time as governor. In fact, about a month after the private briefing, Romney issued an updated projection that was more optimistic, based on healthier revenue projections. In the Globe article, aides to Patrick accused Romney of offering the public sunnier projections in public than they gave in private. But it eventually became clear that the revenue picture was indeed improving -- enough to allow Patrick to restore $383.6 million in emergency budget cuts Romney had made a month earlier. "The revenue did come in a bit better than planned, and ultimately Patrick presented a balanced budget," said Michael Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, an independent budget think tank. Widmer informally advised Patrick’s transition team. "There was a tight budget, and it couldn’t fund some of the increases Patrick had proposed in the campaign, but it didn’t result in major cuts, either." • The ad’s use of the term "debt" is inaccurate. The figure cited in the 2006 briefing referred to a projected shortfall for one fiscal year. "Debt" in the budgetary context refers to the cumulative total of all past deficits, less surpluses. And this wasn't even a deficit -- it was a projected shortfall that state officials had to address in order to balance the budget. • Using the $1 billion figure means taking the high end of a range that begins at $400 million. • Massachusetts, like most states, has a requirement that the governor must submit, and the Legislature must pass, a balanced budget. So contrary to the ad’s suggestion, there was never an official deficit, much less one 10 digits in scope. And even if there had been a deficit that big, Romney wouldn’t get full blame. "The final budget document is the creation of the Massachusetts Legislature, which now has and did have a veto-proof Democratic majority during Romney’s reign," said Fred Bayles, director of the Boston University Statehouse Program. "Governors submit the first budget draft, which then goes through major changes in the Legislature. It is disingenuous for any governor to take the credit or blame for the final budget." Our ruling The ad says Romney "left Massachusetts $1 billion in debt." That is inaccurate or misleading in several ways. The Red, White and Blue fund cherry-picks the highest number from a range of estimates. Also, it was not a "debt." It was just one projected shortfall for the upcoming year -- and one that ultimately didn't materialize. Like most states, Massachusetts must have a balanced budget every year. And in keeping with that requirement, Patrick, the incoming governor, submitted a balanced budget within a few months. We rate the claim False.

pomt-01794	"Ninety percent" of people living in Gaza "don’t have access even to water."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/24/rula-jebreal/rula-jebreal-90-people-gaza-dont-have-access-even-/	Palestinian journalist Rula Jebreal slammed the U.S. media for "biased" coverage of the Israel-Palestine conflict on July 21’s Ronan Farrow Daily. MSNBC had her back the next night on All In With Chris Hayes to talk about the balance between Israeli and Palestinian guests on major American news networks. We checked a claim from that back-and-forth here. Jebreal also took it upon herself to trumpet the news she says goes unreported in the United States. "Most Americans think, okay, Israelis are minding their own business and Palestine woke up one day in Gaza and said okay, let me fire missiles," Jebreal said. "That’s not what’s happening." "They don’t know anything about the siege, 1.8 million Palestinians living under siege in extreme poverty, with 90 percent that don’t have access even to water." By all accounts, the situation in Gaza is bad, but we were surprised to hear that so few people have access to water. Since bombings started We weren’t able to reach Jebreal, but we did get in touch with Juan Cole, a history professor at the University of Michigan who frequently sounds off on Middle Eastern politics and who Jebreal cited during her interview. In a blog post concurring with Jebreal’s assessment of the U.S. media, Cole wrote, "Israeli occupation has left 90% of people in Gaza without potable water." That’s already a step removed from Jebreal -- who didn’t distinguish between access to water, and access to drinking water. (The difference would be in having running water available for cooking and showering). Cole pointed us to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which pointed us to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs’ (OCHA) office in Palestine. Since July 7, when Israel began its military actions against Hamas, OCHA has published daily reports about the circumstances in the Gaza Strip. OCHA’s latest report, covering the period from July 21 to July 22, estimates that "1.2 million people have no or very limited access to water or sanitation services due to damage to the electricity system or lack of fuel to run generators" that provide water, sanitation, and hygiene. According to OCHA, Israel’s bombings are causing definite harm to Gaza’s water systems. The UN has been unable to reach several municipalities because of the threat of bombings, leaving them unable to repair 15 broken wells and six inoperative sewage pumping stages. The Municipality of Gaza reports that they’re pumping less than half the "required" water. With a population of 1.8 million, that means that roughly 67 percent of people living in the Gaza Strip could be classified as having "no or very limited access to water." That’s less than the 90 percent Jabreal claimed and does not account for people who may have limited access to water. Water potability So in the most literal reading, Jabreal is overstating the statistic. But another way to look at Jebreal’s claim is the way Cole said it, that 90 percent of people in Gaza lack access to potable water. That’s close to being accurate. The only natural source of fresh water in Gaza is an aquifer on the southern part of its coast, and according to a 2009 Amnesty International report, 90 to 95 percent of that water isn’t safe for drinking because of seawater, sewage, and runoff from agriculture. That statistic has since been corroborated by the UN. Before the current crisis, roughly 97 percent of households in Gaza had access to water coming from the aquifer, but that the aquifer alone cannot sustain the Gaza Strip. In April 2013, the head of the Palestinian Water Authority estimated that Palestinians purchase 56 million cubic meters of water a year for drinking to make up for what he calls a "severe shortage." And according to the UN, four-fifths of privately sold water isn’t sanitary. What does that all mean? People living in Gaza have access to potable water, but they have to buy it from an outside source. The natural aquifer that people living in Gaza have access to largely is unsafe for drinking. We should note that this problem began well before Israel began bombing. The UN sent Princeton professor Richard Falk to the Gaza Strip in 2013 to report on humanitarian concerns, and Falk wrote that "the Israeli blockade of Gaza has exacerbated water scarcity." Among other things, Falk said, Israel takes a "disproportionate share of water from the coastal aquifer," the Israeli-Palestine Joint Water Committee disproportionately rejects Palestinian proposals for water wells, and Israeli military operations often destroy existing Palestinian wells. Our ruling Jebreal claimed that "90 percent" of people living in Gaza "don’t have access even to water," in the course of arguing that a significant part of the Israel-Palestine situation goes unreported in the United States. Recent estimates suggest that about 67 percent of people living in Gaza currently have little or no access to running water, a figure lower than Jebreal claimed. But what's true is that 90 to 95 percent of the water from Gaza’s coastal aquifer (their only natural source of fresh water) isn’t suitable for drinking. Jebreal’s claim needs that caveat. As such, we rate her statement Mostly True.	None	Rula Jebreal	None	None	None	2014-07-24T15:04:45	2014-07-22	['None']
pomt-07268	The Paul Ryan budget proposal would leave the country "without Medicare."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/25/agenda-project/throw-granny-cliff-asks-what-country-would-be-with/	Amid discussion of the Medicare overhaul proposed by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., an ad created by the Agenda Project, a liberal group, cut through the clutter quite dramatically -- though with critics saying it was literally over the top. The ad, set to "America the Beautiful," shows a man pushing an elderly woman in a wheelchair toward a scenic overlook. At first, the woman is happy, enjoying the sights. But then the man picks up the pace, veers past warning signs and rushes toward a cliff. When he reaches the edge, he tips over the wheelchair, and the woman falls dramatically over the ledge. The man walks calmly away. The ad contains no dialogue, so its point is made through a series of superimposed statements: "In 1965, Americans made Medicare into Law. Today, Medicare provides the health insurance for 46 million Americans. More than half of Americans on Medicare live on less than $28,000 a year. Now, Republicans want to privatize Medicare. Is America beautiful without Medicare?" We decided to check two claims in this ad. One, which we’ll look at in a different item, is whether the Ryan plan would "privatize Medicare." The other, which we’ll investigate here, is whether the Ryan budget proposal would leave the country "without Medicare." First, we’ll provide a summary of the Ryan plan, which was passed by the House in a near-party-line vote and which has more recently prompted some Republicans to oppose it, amid fears that voters will not be comfortable with its approach. Ryan’s plan would dramatically cut federal spending in the name of fiscal discipline. One of its major features is dramatically restructuring Medicare, the government-run health insurance program for those 65 and older. Right now, Medicare pays doctors and hospitals set fees for the care beneficiaries receive. Medicare beneficiaries pay premiums for some types of coverage, and younger workers contribute payroll taxes. Ryan’s plan leaves Medicare as is for people 55 and older. In 2022, though, new beneficiaries would be insured by private insurance companies rather than the federal government, although they would receive "premium support" -- financial assistance from the government for buying insurance. People who need more health care would get a little more money. The proposal requires private insurers to accept all applicants and to charge the same rate for people the same age. The plans would comply with standards set by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which administers the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. The plan gradually raises the Medicare eligibility age to 67 and provides smaller premium support to high earners. We looked at this question before, in relation to an ad run by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the House Democrats’ campaign arm. In part, the ad claimed that by passing the proposal in the House, Republicans had "voted to end Medicare." In conjunction with other misrepresentations, that formulation earned the ad a rating of Pants on Fire. We concluded that, while the Ryan plan represents a dramatic change in Medicare, it was not a proposal to "end" Medicare. Seniors would continue to be offered coverage under the proposal, and the program’s budget would increase every year although at a rate not expected to match the rise in medical costs. The government would still play a critical role in directing the program and setting standards. Many Democrats criticized our ruling, arguing that the Ryan proposal would change the program so fundamentally -- revoking its status as a government-run, single-payer system -- that the plan ends Medicare. As Erica Payne, the founder and president of the Agenda Project, put it, "While it is true that a rose by any other name will smell as sweet, a rose with no petals is just a thorny stick." But we disagree, because dramatically changing a program is not the same as ending it. When we contacted Payne for her view, she said that PolitiFact drew the wrong conclusion from the ad’s use of the phrase "without Medicare." To Payne, the question asks a broader philosophical question rather than making a statement about the Ryan plan. The ad "seeks to broaden the discussion around this specific issue by posing a question of national philosophy," Payne said. "‘Is America beautiful without Medicare?’ is a question all Americans should be discussing. In these budget-challenging times, it is critical to examine what we value most, and which of those things that we value are actually critical to our national pride, indeed to our identity. ... A lawmaker who believes our country is as ‘beautiful’ without Medicare would probably be more likely to support gutting the program to a shadow of its former self." We understand her argument, but we think a reasonable viewer -- especially having just "seen" an old lady being dumped over a cliff -- would take away a more concrete meaning to the question, namely that the Ryan plan ends Medicare. Because we found other problems in the DCCC ad that we did not find in the Agenda Project ad, we’re not giving this particular claim a Pants on Fire rating. But the notion that the Paul Ryan budget proposal would leave the country "without Medicare" merits a rating of False.

pomt-07392	"55 percent of the people who cast a provisional ballot (in Florida) in the last presidential election -- their vote did not count."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/may/02/bill-nelson/bill-nelson-criticizes-state-election-bill-cites-n/	U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson came to Tallahassee during the final week of the legislative session to oppose major changes to election law being considered by the House and Senate. We've written about the bills before. The House version, HB 1355, passed 79-37 on April 21, 2011, while the Senate bill, SB 2086, is awaiting a floor vote. Among many different provisions, the bills would no longer allow voters who have moved or changed their last name to update their information at the polls on Election Day. Instead, those voters would have to file provisional ballots that are reviewed after the election. Republicans say it's a way to eliminate possible voter fraud. But Democrats like Nelson say it's an way to suppress the votes of people most likely to change their names (women) and people most likely to move frequently (young people and college students). At a press conference with Democratic state legislators on May 2, Bay News 9 and Central Florida 13 reporter Troy Kinsey asked Nelson what was so wrong with people having to cast a provisional ballot. "Look at history," Nelson answered. "Look at the provisional ballots in 2008. Fifty-five percent of them were discounted. Fifty-five percent of the people who cast a provisional ballot in the last presidential election -- their vote did not count." We turned to the stats to see in Nelson was right. The Pew Center on the States, widely considered a nonpartisan source, studied the result of provisional ballots cast during the 2008 fall presidential election across all 50 states. They found that, in Florida, wide variation existed between counties on the percentage of provisional ballots that were allowed by local canvassing boards, as well as why ballots that were not counted were ultimately disallowed. More than 80 percent of provisional ballots cast in Duval County were counted, while less than 60 percent were counted in Hillsborough County. In South Florida, 34 percent of the provisional ballots were counted in Miami-Dade. In Broward County, just about 6 percent of the provisional ballots cast ultimately were counted in the results, Pew found. "The precise causes of these variations within Florida are unclear, but the reasons why these ballots were rejected provide a slightly more detailed picture," Pew wrote. "In Broward County, 100 percent of rejected provisional ballots were not counted because they were cast by voters not registered in the state. In Hillsborough County, more than 40 percent of rejected provisional ballots were rejected for being cast in the wrong precinct. Both Duval and Miami-Dade counties saw substantial numbers of rejected provisional ballots because voters’ eligibility could not be established." In total, Pew reported that 35,635 Florida voters submitted provisional ballots in the 2008 fall election (.42 percent of the total 8.4 million who cast ballots for president). Of the 35,635 ballots submitted, 17,314 were counted and 18,321 were not counted. To line that up with Nelson's claim, that means 51.4 percent of the provisional ballots submitted were not counted for one reason or another. We checked the Pew numbers with the Department of State and found just a slight discrepancy. The Department of State says 17,312 votes were counted -- two fewer votes than Pew reported -- but not enough to change the percentage of those who submitted provisional ballots but did not have them counted. State Department spokesman Chris Cate also provided us with provisional ballot statistics from the 2010 general election. They are worth noting because the percentage of provisional ballots ultimately discounted was cut in half when compared to 2008. In the 2010 fall election, local canvassing boards considered 13,181 provisional ballots. Canvassing boards wound up counting 9,790 of the votes and tossing out 3,391 provisional ballots -- or 25.7 percent of the total number of provisional ballots. Nelson said that "55 percent of the people who cast a provisional ballot (in Florida) in the last presidential election -- their vote did not count." Two slight clarifications: Nelson is slightly high on the percentage claim, and he fails to note that the percentage of provisional ballots counted improved greatly in 2010. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Bill Nelson	None	None	None	2011-05-02T14:48:31	2011-05-02	['None']
pomt-05521	Says New Jersey Devils managing partner Jeff Vanderbeek "froze all those monies during the toughest years in ‘08-’09" and "refused to give the charitable dollars that he was required to give by the contract."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/apr/12/cory-booker/cory-booker-claims-devils-managing-partner-jeff-va/	Newark Mayor Cory Booker doesn’t know whether Jeff Vanderbeek was acting out of callous disregard or indifference, but the mayor claims the managing partner of the New Jersey Devils broke his legal obligation to provide funds to the city for charities and job training. A long-running feud between city and team officials over unpaid rent, parking revenues and other issues at the Prudential Center culminated last week in a decision from a panel of arbitrators. That decision leaves Newark owing about $600,000 to the Devils. A few days after denouncing Vanderbeek as a "high-class, high-falutin’ huckster and hustler," Booker continued his battle against the hockey team owner during an April 9 interview on MSNBC’s Morning Joe program. "Not only did he make those promises, but he was required to do so by the contract," Booker said. "He froze all those monies during the toughest years in ‘08-’09, when our economy was falling out. He refused to give the charitable dollars that he was required to give by the contract." For the most part, the mayor’s claim is on solid ground, PolitiFact New Jersey found. As the legal dispute rolled on, the Devils did not make $1.5 million in combined payments over three years of the lease agreement for youth and community sports programs and job training programs, according to the arbitrators’ decision. But the hockey team did pay $346,576 toward those programs for the first year of the lease agreement, according to the decision. In a statement, Booker spokeswoman Anne Torres argued that "the $346,576 paid only represents a fraction of what is owed." "We’re disappointed that Politifact is choosing (to)...ignore the facts surrounding Jeff Vanderbeek’s decision to neglect his public commitments to the city," Torres wrote. "Year after year, the Devils have denied resources to charities and job training programs." Let’s explain how those programs factor into the lease agreement for the arena. Under a February 2005 lease agreement with the Newark Housing Authority, which owns the arena, the Devils agreed to pay rent consisting of four components. At the outset, two of those components were $250,000 annual payments for youth and community sports programs, as well as $250,000 annual payments for job training programs. The Devils paid $173,288 for each of the two sets of programs for the first year of the contract, which ran from October 2007 to June 2008, according to the arbitrators’ decision. The payments were smaller because the first payments applied to less than a full year. But as a result of the legal dispute, the Devils paid no rent in years two through four of the lease agreement, according to the arbitrators’ decision. The team was asserting its right to withhold rent under a clause in the lease agreement, the decision states. Arena spokesman Robert Sommer argued that both the city and the team were withholding payments to each other. "They withheld money as well," Sommer told us. "No payments were being made in either direction." Among other rent payments, the arbitrators determined that the Devils owe $1.5 million for the sports and job training programs for those three years. The hockey team also owes an additional $2,738 for the first year, according to the decision. But instead of getting money back, city officials end up owing money to the Devils, because of parking revenues and other issues addressed in the arbitrators’ decision. Our ruling In an interview on MSNBC’s Morning Joe, Booker claimed Vanderbeek "froze all those monies during the toughest years in ‘08-’09" and "refused to give the charitable dollars that he was required to give by the contract." According to the arbitrators’ decision, the Devils paid $346,576 toward youth and community sports programs and job training programs for the first year of the contract. But the hockey team did not pay $1.5 million in combined payments over the next three years of the contract. We rate the statement Mostly True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-02740	"By using a little-known loophole ... Obama minions are allowing Nestle Company to export precious fresh water out of Lake Michigan."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/dec/17/blog-posting/viral-blog-posts-say-obama-minions-are-allowing-co/	These days, President Barack Obama gets blamed for a lot of things -- the glitchy rollout of the healthcare.gov website, an unusually slow economic recovery, an out-of-control electronic surveillance network. But is he also at fault for selling off Lake Michigan’s water to the highest bidder? Several readers recently asked us to check a claim they had seen circulating on social media. The most commonly shared versions seems to have originated on the conservative blog Coach is Right and the website of the Western Center for Journalism, whose president is longtime conservative activist Floyd Brown. The post on the Western Center for Journalism’s site is headlined, "Barack Obama’s war on America’s fresh water supply." It reads: "By using a little-known loophole in the 2006 Great Lakes Compact, Obama minions are allowing Nestle Company to export precious fresh water out of Lake Michigan to the tune of an estimated $500,000 to $1.8 million per day profit. By draining the precious jewel of the Great Lakes in the middle of America, our federal water managers are allowing the export of our water out of our country across thousands of miles of oceans into the Asian basin plagued by huge population centers that are suffering from their constant lack of fresh water." We did not hear back from the Coach is Right site, but PolitiFact Ohio has previously looked at the question of water being removed from the Great Lakes and found that it was a genuine issue. It stems from an agreement known as the Great Lakes Compact. It was negotiated by and has the force of law in eight states -- Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. (Two Canadian provinces are also involved in Great Lakes water policy decisions, but technically aren’t part of the compact.) The most important provision for this fact-check is its prohibition on diverting water from the Great Lakes basin -- with a key exception. That exception -- the "loophole" referred to in the blog post -- is that the compact permits the removal of water in containers of 5.7 gallons or less. The existence of this provision has enabled the bottled-water industry to construct major facilities in the Great Lakes basin, including one by Nestle Waters North America in Mecosta County, Mich. Because the compact was designed to regulate and preserve the Great Lakes -- one of the world’s great natural repositories of fresh water -- such commercial sales have been controversial. Peter Annin, author of The Great Lakes Water Wars, told PolitiFact Ohio that the provision was one of the most emotional issues during the compact’s negotiation. "Many people opposed the loophole during the negotiations, but each state included it anyway when they passed the legislation," said Melissa K. Scanlan, a professor at Vermont Law School who specializes in water law. Legislative fixes have been periodically floated in Congress, but none has yet advanced. So there’s no doubt that the question of whether Great Lakes water should be bottled for sale elsewhere is hotly contested. But does Obama have a role in it? No, experts tell us. Here’s why: • The compact was in force before Obama was even inaugurated. The agreement was negotiated during the mid 2000s, then approved individually in 2007 and 2008 by the legislatures and governors of all eight member states. Then, it was passed by both chambers of Congress and signed by President George W. Bush in 2008. Obama became president in 2009. We should note that Obama was in the U.S. Senate when it passed that chamber. The compact passed the Senate by unanimous consent -- that is, approval without any objections from senators and without a recorded vote of yeas and nays. Still, the heavy legislative lifting was long done by that point, and with so many other state and federal entities weighing in during the lengthy negotiation and approval process, it seems a stretch to attribute primary blame for the "loophole" to then-Sen. Obama. • It is a compact among states, not something imposed by the federal government. According to Article 1, Section 10 of the Constitution, the U.S. House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate and the president must give their approval to an interstate compact. However, once approved, compacts are fundamentally agreements between states, not between the states and the federal government. Several experts told PolitiFact that there is no significant oversight or enforcement role for the federal government in regards to the compact -- in other words, no opportunity for Obama’s "minions" to cause havoc. • Elected officials from both parties had a role in approving the compact, and continue to carry out its provisions. State legislatures and governors of both parties approved the compact initially, and today, a majority of the states and legislative chambers that are party to the agreement are actually controlled by Republicans, not Democrats. In Michigan, the state where the Nestle plant is located, the governor’s office and both chambers of the Legislature are in Republican hands. In general, the Great Lakes Compact has been "very nonpartisan for an environmental policy," said Noah Hall, a professor at Wayne State University Law School in Detriot and author of the Great Lakes Law blog. Our ruling Bloggers have said that "by using a little-known loophole ... Obama minions are allowing Nestle Co. to export precious fresh water out of Lake Michigan." There is an ongoing debate over whether Great Lakes water should be sold commercially out of the region, but Obama’s role in creating, approving and enforcing the Great Lakes Compact on an ongoing basis -- which is likely the driving reason the claim has attracted attention on social media -- is actually minimal, experts say. In other words, his "minions" have not meddled in this dispute. The claim contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-09178	"Two-thirds of the top-rated hospitals in Florida were our hospitals."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/jun/04/rick-scott/rick-scott-former-healthcare-ceo-defends-columbiah/	Even when condensed to two paragraphs, you can see the potential land mines Rick Scott, a Republican running for governor, might face over his former hospital chain, Columbia/HCA. Paragraph 1. Scott grew Columbia/HCA into the nation's biggest hospital system. It then became the center of a multi-state federal investigation in 1997 that centered around whether Columbia/HCA defrauded Medicare and Medicaid. Scott resigned under pressure in 1997 as the scope of the investigation grew. Paragraph 2. Columbia/HCA eventually settled the fraud cases, paying a record-setting $1.7 billion in fines. The company pleaded guilty to at least 14 corporate felonies. Four people also were indicted; two were convicted, but those convictions were overturned on appeal. Scott himself was not indicted or questioned in the case. Largest fine ever. $1.7 billion. Resigned under pressure. A third-party group, the Alliance for America’s Future, has crafted a 30-second ad attacking Scott's record at Columbia/HCA. And there's a baiting Twitter account, ScottFraudFiles, being pushed by supporters of Bill McCollum, Scott's Republican primary rival. The attacks are being countered by Scott, who has deep pockets and already has spent millions of dollars on television advertisements. Scott launched a website, www.truthaboutrickscott.com, to refute claims about his time leading Columbia/HCA. He also is up with a new television ad called "Truth," where Scott challenges McCollum on the Columbia/HCA story. Looking directly into the camera, here's what Scott says: Bill McCollum’s been in politics for 30 years. You’d think he’d want to talk about his record. Instead he’s just attacking me. That’s what career politicians do. I’m going to do something the politicians never will, give you the unvarnished truth. The McCollum crowd says the hospital company I started was fined by the government for Medicare fraud. Unfortunately, that’s true. I wasn’t ever charged or even questioned by the authorities, but that’s not what matters. What matters is that the company made mistakes. And as CEO I take responsibility and I learned from it. Now here’s the part McCollum leaves out: Two-thirds of the top-rated hospitals in Florida were our hospitals. Our hospitals earned the highest quality rating, 4 times the national average. We had the best care at the lowest prices for our patients. If you want a career politician, go with McCollum… But if you want someone who learns, leads, and demands accountability … I’m Rick Scott, let’s get to work. Since this is a Florida campaign, we decided to check Scott's claim that two-thirds of the top-rated hospitals in Florida were owned by Columbia/HCA. (First, a note. We love seeing fact-check journalism and noticed that Michael Putney of WPLG in Miami dissected the Alliance for America’s Future ad and, to a lesser extent, Scott's rebuttal that we're analyzing here. We think you should check out his report. It starts about 35 seconds in.) Scott's campaign said the claim about Columbia/HCA's Florida hospitals comes from a December 1995 article in a health care trade publication, Modern Healthcare. The article references a 1994 study of America's hospital system. The study, performed by Health Care Investment Analysts and William Mercer, rates hospitals in terms of cost efficiency and patient outcomes -- measuring mortality rates, length of stays for patients, the number of employees needed to treat a patient, occupancy rates and financial performance. HCIA and and William Mercer then create a list of the nation's Top 100 hospitals. The list is subdivided by the type of hospital -- rural, urban, teaching hospital, etc. "Of the 17 hospitals from Florida in the top 100, 12 are in one category: nonteaching hospitals of more than 250 beds. All are Columbia hospitals," the Modern Healthcare article says. The article mentions that one of the 12 was purchased by Columbia/HCA after the study was performed, so really it's 11 out of 17. That's 65 percent, or right around what Scott mentioned in his ad. We checked subsequent years of the study and found similar results. In 1995, the same study rated 13 Florida hospitals among the Top 100. Nine of those hospitals were Columbia/HCA properties, or 69 percent. Twelve of 17 Top 100 Florida hospitals (70.5 percent) were run by Columbia/HCA in 1996, according to the same study. That's all right in line with what Scott said, but it fails to account for those big land mines we mentioned earlier. If the study measures financial performance, for instance, did Columbia/HCA hospitals rank artificially because it defrauded Medicare and Medicaid? We turned to one of the authors of the study, Jean Chenoweth, to find out. Chenoweth now works for Thomson Reuters, which continues to publish the annual hospital survey. We asked: Had you and the study group known about Columbia/HCA's Medicare fraud investigation -- would that have affected the rankings? She said: "We can’t give a definitive answer to a hypothetical question. Our policy calls for us to rescind any 100 Top Hospital Award found to have been given on the basis of inaccurate data. Columbia/HCA settled its case, so we have no proof or admission that specific data that led to a specific hospital receiving a 100 Top Hospital Award was inaccurate. That makes this difficult to answer definitively." Chenoweth's answer muddies things a bit in our minds. Because the corporate fraud charges were settled, there never was a public airing of the specific allegations. And because there was never a public airing of the specific allegations -- and a finding of guilt -- the study authors were unable to see if the figures they measured were deemed fraudulent. It's also important to note that the study was focused on the outcomes of individual hospitals while the federal investigation centered around dozens of Columbia/HCA properties. Where does this leave us? In his ad "Truth," Scott certainly cites the Top 100 hospital report correctly when he says that two-thirds of the Florida hospitals to make the list were owned by Columbia/HCA. But he glosses over the fact that those rankings could at least be questioned because fraud-laden data may have been used in the analysis to make the rating. The author of the study doesn't know if the data was accurate or cooked, because the fraud case never went to trial. We found no evidence to say the rankings are bogus, but we think the claim could use a little additional information. To us, that correlates to a rating of Mostly True.

pomt-11712	Says Sen. Mitch McConnell's delay in seating Alabama Sen.-elect Doug Jones "is a flagrant violation of Senate policy, which requires Jones assume office the instant one of them wins the election."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/dec/18/verified-politics/seating-doug-jones-does-delay-break-senate-rules/	Alabama Democrat Doug Jones might have won a Senate seat, but according to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Jones won’t officially take that seat until early January. With Republicans pushing hard to pass their $1.5 trillion tax bill before Christmas, their opponents cast McConnell’s move as a pure political play. "This is a flagrant violation of Senate policy, which requires Jones assume office the instant one of them wins the election," said an article on the website Verified Politics. "But the craven majority leader doesn’t want a moral Democrat sabotaging his precious tax scam that steals from the poor to give to the rich." We looked at the Senate rules, the Senate schedule and the history of special elections. The argument that any delay represents a violation of Senate policy doesn’t hold up. In fact, when we reached out to Verified Politics, they apologized for the error and changed their article. It now reads, "This is a flagrant violation of the spirit of Senate rules." That’s quite a shift. While we welcome the correction, our policy is to rate claims as originally stated and to share our research with readers. McConnell teed up this controversy early on the day of the Dec. 12 special election when he told reporters that no winner would be sworn in before January. "Sen. (Luther) Strange is going to be here through the end of this session," McConnell said. Typically, the session ends in December, although it has come as late as Jan. 3. Right now, the plan is to end in December. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com A timing problem Under the Standing Rules of the Senate, a new senator takes the oath of office after the governor and secretary of state from the state certifies the election. That oath takes place during "open Senate." Both the timeline in Alabama and the holidays work against seating Jones immediately. Alabama law says each county has until the second Friday after a special election to certify the outcome. In this case, that falls on Dec. 22. After that, the law gives the governor and secretary of state another 10 days to certify the statewide outcome. With Christmas and New Year’s Day as official holidays, that would push the deadline to Jan. 3, 2018. That said, the spokesman for the Alabama Secretary of State told us certification would likely take place around Dec. 28, although the exact timing is uncertain. So for starters, the delay is on the Alabama end, not in the U.S. Senate. After that, Jones runs into the problem of the holidays. In theory, the Senate could remain in session between Christmas and New Year’s. Typically, it’s in recess. While some last-minute turmoil could change that -- involving the tax bill or keeping the government running -- at the moment, it looks like lawmakers will be home for the holidays. That means lawmakers come back in the first week of January. If Jones weren’t seated at that point, then Democrats would have plenty of reason to object, but that isn’t what McConnell laid out. The average wait There have been 11 special elections since World War II that match Jones’ situation. A speedy placement happened twice. It took one day to seat William Proxmire, D-Wis., in 1957, and two days for John Durkin, D-N.H., in 1975. The longest delay was 41 days for Quentin Burdick, D-N.D., in 1960. On average, the wait was 15 days. Even if Alabama certified Jones that fast, it would still fall on Dec. 27. Recent special elections have not run into the holiday recess issue. In February 2010, Scott Brown, R-Mass., was seated 16 days after his election. It took 21 days for Ed Markey, D-Mass., to take the oath of office in July 2013. Cory Booker, D-N.J., waited 15 days in October 2013. Our ruling An article in Verified Politics said that anything other than instantly seating Jones would be a flagrant violation of Senate policy. That is incorrect, and when we brought this to the website’s attention, they dialed back their claim to say seating Jones in January violated the spirit of Senate rules. Senate rules rely on states to certify election results. Alabama’s process puts certification into the week between Christmas and New Year’s Day. If the Senate is in recess, as it nearly always is, then Jones would have to wait until the first week of January. On average, the delay in seating senators who win special elections is 15 days. The statement is not accurate. We rate it False. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com	None	Verified Politics	None	None	None	2017-12-18T11:31:12	2017-12-13	['Alabama', 'Mitch_McConnell']
pomt-12671	Small businesses "create two out of every three American jobs."	true	/missouri/statements/2017/mar/17/claire-mccaskill/sen-mccaskill-right-about-small-business-job-creat/	There has been controversy surrounding several of President Donald Trump’s Cabinet picks. Notable selections, such as Betsy DeVos, Rex Tillerson and Jeff Sessions, have drawn the ire of Democrats and even a few Republicans. One choice that didn’t receive much criticism was the appointment of Linda McMahon as administrator of the Small Business Administration. McMahon was approved by an 81-19 vote by the Senate, one of the more lopsided approvals of Trump’s Cabinet positions. She was so well-respected that even Missouri Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill gave her a ringing endorsement, saying in a press release that "I’m looking forward to working with Ms. McMahon on ideas to bolster small businesses and entrepreneurship in Missouri." In that same press release, though, McCaskill said something that caught our eye. She said: "Small businesses — which create two out of every three American jobs — are an engine for job growth that we’ve got to support and sustain." The first part of that statement stuck out to us. What’s defined as a small business? Do small businesses really produce that many jobs? We decided to do some digging into McCaskill’s claim. What’s a small business? When you think of small businesses, you usually think of "mom and pop" shops that are locally owned and have a few employees. However, the government’s definition of small business is any business that employs fewer than 500 people. According to a 2016 newsletter published by the Small Business Administration’s Office of Advocacy, as of 2013, there were 28.8 million small businesses in the United States. That 28.8 million made up 99.7 percent of the businesses in the U.S. and provided 56.8 million jobs for U.S. workers. Having nearly 29 million small businesses in the country provides a very strong economic impact. In the United States, 54 percent of all sales come from small businesses. 97.7 percent of all U.S. trade exporters are also small business owners, making small business a key fixture of the United States economy. How many jobs do small businesses create? While all of the numbers listed above are important in understanding the impact of small businesses, it doesn’t answer our question about the accuracy of McCaskill’s claim. When we asked McCaskill press secretary Sarah Feldman where the senator got her numbers, she directed us to a 2011 report on the state of small businesses. In it, the report says that small businesses have "created 64 percent of new American private sector jobs generated in the past 15 years — that’s 40 million net new jobs according to the Council of Economic Advisers." That report was from six years ago. We wanted to see if there were any current reports on small businesses in the United States. Luckily, the Small Business Administration posted an article breaking down recent small business trends. It states that "small businesses provide 55 percent of all jobs and 66 percent of all net new jobs since the 1970s." This backs McCaskill’s claim that two out of every three American jobs are created by small businesses. An important thing to point out Something to note, though, is that just because two out of every three new jobs is created by a small business, that doesn’t mean 66 percent of the U.S. workforce is employed by small business. As stated above, 55 percent of U.S. workers are employed by small businesses. While this is an increase from 48 percent in 2013, small business employment still does not represent two-thirds of the workforce in America. This is important to differentiate because McCaskill’s statement could be misinterpreted to say that. She is strictly talking about the creation of jobs, not the overall amount of small business jobs in the country. Our ruling Upon the approval of McMahon as administrator to the Small Business Administration, senator McCaskill release a press release that said, in part, "Small businesses — which create two out of every three American jobs—are an engine for job growth that we’ve got to support and sustain." While two-thirds of the workforce is not employed by small businesses, 66 percent of net new jobs since the 1970s have been created by small businesses. And though McCaskill’s statement could be interpreted differently, her statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing. We rate this statement True.

pomt-01761	Mary Burke "wasted 12.5 million dollars on a vacant lot" in a move that "could cost taxpayers nearly $25 million."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jul/31/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-mary-burkes-deal-help-abbott-lab/	In July 2014, Gov. Scott Walker’s re-election campaign targeted a so-far failed effort begun by challenger Mary Burke to lure a major Illinois-based drug company to expand in the Kenosha area. Now Walker’s back on the air with another TV ad related to that economic development deal. In mid-July we rated Mostly True a Walker claim that Burke, as state commerce chief in 2006, spent more than $12 million for land to help Abbott Laboratories even though the firm had presented "no plans to create jobs in Wisconsin." Federal Housing and Urban Development officials who provided the $12 million to Wisconsin concluded that the Commerce Department never got a written commitment from Abbott. Now they want the money back. In the new ad, Walker contends that Burke’s economic development strategy in the Abbott case "could cost taxpayers nearly $25 million" in "wasted" funds. But how can a $12.3 million deal become $25 million lost? The deal itself The Walker ads focus on a March 2006 announcement by Burke and then-Gov. Jim Doyle of a $12.5 million forgivable loan funded with federal money, specifically community development block grant funds. The money was to buy a 40-acre parcel in order to block a truck-stop development that local officials thought would discourage Abbott’s development of 500 acres the firm had acquired in Kenosha County for a potential corporate campus. Under a complex agreement with the state Commerce Department, the funds were passed through the Village of Pleasant Prairie to an arm of the Kenosha Area Business Alliance. The business alliance then used the funds to buy and hold two parcels for Abbott, with a proviso that the land could not go to Abbott unless the company showed -- by 2016 -- that it would create at least 2,400 jobs. Ultimately, $12.3 million, not $12.5 million, went for the deal. Eight years later, with two years left on that deadline, Abbott hasn’t made its contemplated Wisconsin move a reality. And HUD has declared that the project -- which it called a "speculative land banking venture" -- was ineligible for block grant funding in the first place. The state will pay half the $12.3 million back in cash, and the other half will come in a reduction of future block grant money to the state. The campaign’s math We spoke to Tom Evenson, a Walker campaign spokesman, about the ad’s claim that "taxpayers" could be out $25 million through the $12.3 million deal. He said that Walker views it as the state "paying twice" -- $12.3 million it has to repay, and the lost economic development the money could have generated if it had been used differently at the time. That "opportunity cost" argument is problematic for several reasons. The ad presents the math in concrete terms -- "taxpayer" dollars. And no matter how you cut it, the $12.3 million is being counted twice. So what are taxpayers out so far, and what are the possible outcomes when the smoke finally clears on this deal? The federal government put up the $12.3 million, but is getting the money back. State taxpayers didn’t provide the $12.3 million in the first place, but they will fork over $6.15 million in cash to repay HUD. The $6.15 million in lost future block grants from the feds means Wisconsin loses whatever benefit they might have provided. But state taxpayers don’t necessarily have to replace the lost federal funds with state funds. So depending on how you score that last item, the tab so far is either $6.15 million or $12.3 million. In the end, the total could be smaller. Under the Burke-signed deal, if no Abbott development occurs, the 40 acres could be sold and thereby generate some cash to offset the $12.3 million cost. The land is now assessed at about $6.7 million, according to local officials. The final proceeds to the state, though could be reduced to less than $3 million, however, because the agreement called for local officials to be reimbursed for paying taxes and utilities and other costs associated with the land. They say they have spent $3.9 million on those items. If the land can’t be sold, of course, there’s no offset to the state’s $12.3 million bill, or the locals’ $3.9 million. Either way, though, the hard numbers don’t approach $25 million. Finally, what about "wasted?" Walker’s math rests in part on the assumption that Burke’s deal never had a chance, in 2006 or now, to succeed. It looks like a faint hope now, though the land has been and is ready for development. And HUD’s criticisms fuel the notion that the deal, done in an election year for Doyle, was a pie-in-the-sky notion from the start. On the other hand, Commerce Department records show that Abbott’s interest developed over several years as it bought up 500 acres and dealt quietly with officials in a project they code-named "Project Doo Dah." Local officials came to the state to ask for help in buying up what it saw as a crucial final puzzle piece to attract Abbott and up to 12,000 jobs. At one point in late 2004, local officials were told that Abbott was choosing between Wisconsin and one other place for its expansion, according to a November 2004 email between Pleasant Prairie and business alliance officials. And Walker’s own administrators argued to HUD in 2013 that buying the vacant land "has allowed the (Village of Pleasant Prairie) to remove slum and blight from the area and has created an environment in which Abbott Laboratories will want to move forward and construct their campus." It also opened the door to major spin-off development, including Uline's new corporate headquarters and distribution facility that already employ more than 850, Lisa Marks, Walker’s housing administrator, wrote to HUD. Our rating Walker’s ad says that Mary Burke "wasted 12.5 million dollars on a vacant lot," a move that "could cost taxpayers nearly $25 million." The spot greatly exaggerates the real taxpayer costs and ignores the Walker administration’s own praise to HUD for the project. We rate the claim False.

pomt-05756	Says Rick Santorum "opposes right-to-work"	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/01/ron-paul/ron-paul-says-rick-santorum-opposes-right-work/	In a video ad released Feb. 28, 2012, Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, took aim at all three of his remaining rivals in the Republican presidential primary race -- Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum. In this item, we’ll check the ad’s claim that Santorum "opposes right-to-work" -- a policy that "guarantees that no person can be compelled, as a condition of employment, to join or not to join, nor to pay dues to a labor union," as the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation defines it. Under the Taft-Hartley Act, passed in 1947, states are authorized to pass such laws, and 23 have done so. (They are Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Kansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and Wyoming.) Generally speaking, expanding right-to-work laws is popular among Republican primary and caucus voters, so it has become an issue in this year’s primary season. It’s also on the agenda for lawmakers in states such as Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maine, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. During the primary season, Paul has tried to distinguish himself from Santorum over the issue, charging that Santorum has been soft in his support for right-to-work. We should note that the Paul ad uses the present tense when it says Santorum "opposes right-to-work," so Santorum’s current position will be significant in our analysis. We began by visiting Santorum’s website. On the site, we found the following under the heading, "The Truth About Right to Work." "In the Senate, Rick voted to allow states to determine their own right-to-work laws. These laws protect employees from having to join unions in order to work for a company. Today, Rick believes that a National Right-to-Work law is important to curb union abuses and further strengthen the manufacturing sectors of our economy." In addition to what Santorum said on his website, he has also said the following: • "I've already signed a pledge and said I would sign a national right to work bill," Santorum said in the CNN debate in South Carolina. After being pressed by moderator John King, Santorum added, "Well, maybe you didn't hear what I said. I said I would support a national right to work law and sign it into law and would support and advocate for one. " • Speaking on WJR-AM 760 in Detroit, Santorum said he would sign national right-to-work legislation. "A national right-to-work bill is something that I would be supportive of," he said. So "today," Santorum says he supports a national right-to-work law. Viewed in isolation, that would seem to make the Paul ad’s claim flat wrong. However, the fact that Santorum felt the need to add a line on his website about his past views suggests that there’s been some fluidity in his position -- and there has been. On July 10, 1996, the Senate took a "cloture" vote to move toward consideration of the National Right to Work Act of 1995, which, among other things, would have amended the National Labor Relations Act and the Railway Labor Act to repeal federal provisions that require employees to pay union dues or fees as a condition of employment. According to Senate rules, individual senators or groups of senators have the power to stall bills indefinitely through a filibuster. Such blockages can only be broken by a 60-vote supermajority. If 60 senators vote for cloture, the blocked bill may proceed to a vote on its merits. If fewer than 60 senators vote for cloture, the bill remains stalled. The cloture vote for the National Right to Work Act of 1995 garnered only 31 yes votes, compared to 68 no votes, meaning that the bill remained blocked. One of those no votes was Santorum’s. So it’s fair to say that Santorum in 1996 helped stop a national right-to-work bill in its tracks. (Santorum was actually one of 20 Republicans who voted no, compared to 31 Republicans who voted yes.) Santorum has explained this vote on federalism grounds -- that he didn’t like the idea of Pennsylvania’s long-established laws being overturned by federal decree. "When I was a senator from Pennsylvania, which is a state that is not a right-to-work state, the state made a decision not to be right-to-work," Santorum said when pressed on the issue during a CNN debate in South Carolina on Jan. 19, 2012. "And I wasn't going to go to Washington and overturn that from the federal government and do that to the state." The fact that Santorum had to win election in a swing state may also have been a factor: He comes from western Pennsylvania, where it’s common to find socially conservative but pro-labor Democrats willing to cross lines and vote for a Republican. Meanwhile, on one occasion -- a Fox News debate in Orlando, Fla., on Sept. 22, 2011 -- Santorum sidestepped a direct question about a national right-to-work law. Santorum focused his answer on assailing public-employee unions, saying he would "support a bill that says that we should not have public employee unions for the purposes of wages and benefits to be negotiated." But he did not specifically address the question about his stance on a national right-to-work law. Santorum’s explanation of his change in position didn’t cut it with Paul’s campaign. "Fact: Rick Santorum voted against it in the United States Senate. End of story," Jesse Benton, Paul's national campaign chairman, told PolitiFact. Paul’s position also meshes with the "National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation." Patrick Semmens, the group’s director of legal information, last month emailed the website BuzzFeed that Santorum's "position on right-to-work should be deeply troubling to the 80 percent of Americans who believe workers should not be forced to pay dues or fees to a union just to get or keep a job. Not only has he refused to answer the National Right to Work Committee's Presidential Survey, but while in the Senate he joined with Democrats to filibuster the National Right to Work Act." Even so, as we noted before, the Paul ad uses the present tense -- and that clashes with Santorum’s statement, reiterated on several occasions, that he supports a national right-to-work law today. Our ruling Santorum clearly has a zig-zagging history with his positions on a national right-to-work law. If we’d rated this on the PolitiFact Flip-O-Meter, it would likely qualify as a Full Flop. However, the Paul ad states that Santorum "opposes right-to-work" -- which means today. Despite his past history, Santorum has stated on several occasions that he would work on behalf of (and if he became president, sign) a national right-to-work law. On balance, we rate the ad’s claim Half True.	None	Ron Paul	None	None	None	2012-03-01T10:29:50	2012-02-28	['Rick_Santorum']
pomt-02988	The "president has given 1,100 special waivers to his friends" for Obamacare.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/18/mick-mulvaney/rep-mulvaney-says-obama-gave-1100-special-waivers-/	On the last morning of the government shutdown and debt ceiling standoff, the conservative lawmakers who took the hardest line in the showdown stood firm even as they faced defeat. One of them, Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., said it was all worthwhile given the principle at stake. Asked on CBS News what that principle was, Mulvaney said it was about fairness under Obamacare. "Our question, for the last three weeks, has been, ‘Why is it not evenly applied across all the citizens?’ " Mulvaney said. The president, he said, "has given 1,100 special waivers to his friends. Now he gave it most recently to large corporations. All we have been asking for the last two and a half weeks is that those same exemptions apply to our families." Here, we’ll examine whether President Barack Obama "has given 1,100 special waivers to his friends." This is a claim that Mulvaney’s political allies have made several times. Groups such as the Christian Coalition have circulated it, although the exact number sometimes varies. Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, said "almost 1,100 waivers." Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., said it was over 1,200. We reached out to Mulvaney’s office to get the details but didn’t hear back. Our research took us (as well as our fact checking colleagues at the Washington Post) to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The waivers in question have to do with private insurance plans that cost very little but cap the total amount they will pay at less than $1.25 million in a single year. The limits can be considerably less. There are plans that don’t pay more than $2,000 and even one that stops at $300. That threshold matters because one big thing the Affordable Care Act does is set minimum standards for health insurance -- including the elimination of annual caps by 2014. The law says there can be no limits, but it left it to the Secretary of Health and Human Services to set rules for how to transition to that goal. Those rules said that as of 2011, every plan had to pay at least $1.25 million, and as of 2014, with very few exceptions, there could be no annual limits at all. But even putting the transition on a glide path created a potential dilemma, especially for large firms that hire many low-wage workers. Faced with having to improve their coverage quickly, there was a chance that many employers would instead drop the insurance altogether. To avoid leaving those workers with no insurance at all, HHS set up a way for companies and insurance plans to apply for waivers. Who got a waiver? The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services tallies who has been granted a waiver, and who applied but was denied. At last count, the total number of waivers was 1,231. So Mulvaney’s has actually undercounted somewhat. However, his use of the term "friends" is more questionable. Here is a sample of some of the recipients: Baptist Retirement Homes of North Carolina. Pepsi. The Wyoming Lodging and Restaurant Association. Goodwill Industries of Kentucky. Wendy’s. McDonald’s. The common denominator seems to be who these firms hire -- low-wage workers. If "friendship" played a role, it’s hard to discern. And it’s not clear that these are major political allies of the president, either. On the other hand, some unions -- which usually lean Democratic -- were on the list as well. We found about 450 plans that serve union workers -- roughly a third of the total. That said, 144 groups were denied a waiver, and union plans were included on that list as well. Plans could reapply and some did. In general, if a plan reapplied, it then got a waiver. Unions show up a lot in this group, but some ultimately were turned down. We should also note that Mulvaney called these "special waivers." But by and large, whoever applied tended to get approved. That doesn’t seem particularly special to us. All of these waivers expire as of Jan. 1, 2014. Our ruling Mulvaney said that under Obamacare, the president "has given 1,100 special waivers to his friends." He’s close on the number, but it’s wrong to say that all (or even most) went to his "friends" or political allies. It’s also doubtful that any of these were "special," since the option was widely publicized and mostly granted when applied for. We rate the claim Mostly False.

Al Franken is leaving his Senate seat to avoid some unspecified scandal is so fake, it’s stolen from another fake news story about a different senator. "Libtard hero Al Franken forced to resign in disgrace," read the headline on a June 15, 2017, post on Breakingtop.world, which has hidden its registration information. Facebook users flagged the post as possible being fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to fight fake news. "Libtard Democrat Al Franken will resign his seat as U.S. Senator and Minority Leader this morning after learning that the White House has enough on him to ruin his marriage and send him to jail," the post read. "Rather than face the backlash and vindictive response from the Trump administration to his requests to play ball, Franken will resign, deny all of the allegations and spend the next 7 1/2 years under investigation by Trey Gowdy." The post is definitely fake. There has been no announcement that the former comedian Franken, D-Minn., is quitting after winning re-election in 2014. Otherwise he probably would have mentioned it during his recent NPR interview. Breakingtop.world doesn’t have any contact information, but it does have a Facebook page titled "Fake News Report." That’s quite a clue that this is made up. The site referred to the source of its post as a June 14 version of the article on OurLandOfTheFree.com, another parody website with hidden registration information. OurLandOfTheFree.com says in its footer note that the site makes "no guarantee that what you read here is true. In fact, it's probably not." It echoes the warning on its About Us page. But if you noticed, the post referred to Franken as the Senate minority leader, which he isn’t. That role belongs to Democrat Chuck Schumer. The Breakingtop.world post even mentions ousting Schumer later in the text. That detail is wrong because the entire article has essentially copied a May 23 post on TheLastLineOfDefense.org that really was about Schumer. TheLastLineOfDefense.org is a parody website run by liberal troll Christopher Blair. Blair’s goal is to publish fake stories with absurd narratives in an attempt to fool conservatives. How this story ended up getting copied and passed on as a dig at Franken is anyone’s guess, but it’s not true. We rate this statement Pants On Fire!

pomt-04794	"In Florida, they're already talking about how the Ryan-Romney plan will end Medicare and replace it with a voucher."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/aug/22/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-ryan-romney-plan-will-end-medica/	The buzz among Floridians these days isn’t the start of college football. It’s Medicare, says President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign. "In Florida, they're already talking about how the Ryan-Romney plan will end Medicare and replace it with a voucher," begins a new radio ad from Obama’s campaign. The ad moves at a slow pace, featuring a back-and-forth between soothing male and female voices that say things such as the "Ryan Medicare Plan" would affect future retirees, and the "Romney-Ryan plan" would raise health care costs. They decry Romney’s VP pick because Ryan wanted to "change the whole game when it comes to Medicare and Social Security." "What does that really say about Mitt Romney and whether he really understands Florida, the folks who live here, or what matters to our future?" PolitiFact Florida wanted to analyze the statement that "the Ryan-Romney plan will end Medicare and replace it with a voucher." What is the Ryan-Romney plan? The "Ryan-Romney" or "Romney-Ryan" Medicare plan isn’t a written-out plan, but Romney’s statements of support for previous Medicare proposals. Ryan, the House Budget Committee chairman from Wisconsin, has released several ideas since 2011 to overhaul the government-run health insurance program mainly for seniors. After Romney selected Ryan as his running mate, he said he and Ryan were on the same page for changes to Medicare. "Paul Ryan and my plan for Medicare, I think, is the same, if not identical -- it's probably close to identical," he said in an Aug. 15, 2012, interview with a Wisconsin TV station. Romney was referring to Ryan’s most recent plan, released earlier this year, which would rewrite how Medicare works for people who are under age 55. Instead of paying for seniors’ health care bills, the government would offer future beneficiaries fixed payments -- voucher-like credits -- that could go toward private plans. Beneficiaries could use those credits to select a traditional Medicare plan or a private plan from a competitive marketplace, or exchange, that complies with standards set by the government. The amount a beneficiary receives would be based on the second least-expensive plan available. We don’t know whether the premium subsidy would be able to cover the same set of benefits as traditional Medicare, or how much it would add to out-of-pocket costs to beneficiaries, because the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office hasn’t released a detailed analysis, as it did for an earlier version of Ryan’s proposal when he provided the office with more substantial details. Does this approach "end Medicare"? No. Even when discussing Ryan’s earliest Medicare overhaul, which would have moved the program entirely to private insurers, PolitiFact has said repeatedly the proposal would not "end," "destroy" or "abolish" Medicare. While Medicare under the original Ryan plan would have been essentially privatized, and many seniors would have had to pay more than they do now as health care costs increase, government-supported health insurance coverage for seniors would not have gone away away. Now, under Ryan and Romney’s proposals, a traditional Medicare plan would remain an option. Would Medicare be replaced with a voucher? Pretty much. PolitiFact visited the semantics of the "voucher" issue in an Aug. 16, 2012, story, dissecting the linguistic differences between calling the Republicans’ Medicare vision a "voucher" system versus their preferred terminology, "premium support." After consulting experts in health care and language, PolitiFact rated Obama’s characterization of Romney and Ryan wanting "to turn Medicare into a voucher system" Mostly True. We should note, though, the government would continue to regulate Medicare plans. Also, the plan does not literally provide people with a paper voucher, but it does give them a credit to buy their own insurance. We think that’s voucher-like. Our ruling A radio ad from the Obama campaign says, "In Florida, they're already talking about how the Ryan-Romney plan will end Medicare and replace it with a voucher." None of the plans presented by these candidates will "end" Medicare. Instead, Romney and Ryan support substantial changes to Medicare for people under 55. Depending on their income, future beneficiaries will receive a "premium support payment" to help offset the cost of a plan purchased through a competitive marketplace or for a traditional Medicare plan.

pomt-10702	Supported in-state tuition in Arkansas for illegal immigrants "if you'd sat in our schools from the time you're 5 or 6 years old and you had become an A-plus student," among other things.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/29/mike-huckabee/tuition-bill-wasnt-that-strict/	During a Republican presidential debate Nov. 28, 2007, a questioner asked Mike Huckabee about his support for a 2005 measure in Arkansas that would have granted in-state tuition to the children of illegal immigrants. Though the bill never made it out of the legislature, critics still question his support of it. Huckabee described the law's requirements as stringent, applying only to students "if you'd sat in our schools from the time you're 5 or 6 years old and you had become an A-plus student, you'd completed the core curriculum, you were an exceptional student, and you also had to be drug- and alcohol-free — and the other provision, you had to be applying for citizenship." That's quite a number of restrictions. Did the bill outline all that? No. The bill, proposed by Rep. Joyce Elliott, D-Little Rock, said that students had to have spent three years in Arkansas high schools and graduated, and they had to sign an affidavit saying they intended to pursue citizenship. Then they would be eligible for in-state tuition and a popular state scholarship program, the Academic Challenge Scholarship, just like their fellow classmates. Huckabee conflates the proposed law with rules for the scholarship, which does have requirements for a core curriculum and drug-testing. Maybe Huckabee was confused on which programs he was talking about; he had mentioned the Academic Challenge Scholarship by name a few moments earlier. But even granting a mix-up, Huckabee is plain wrong about the A-plus average — the scholarship requires a 3.0 out of 4.0. And there's no requirement for attending state schools since age 5 or 6. We award Huckabee a Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-03314	"We have no idea what is contained in [electronic cigarette] vapor."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2013/jul/27/teresa-tanzi/rhode-island-rep-teresa-tanzi-says-contents-electr/	A lot of things are said in the heat of debate on the floor at the General Assembly. As PolitiFact Rhode Island listened during a July 1, 2013 discussion of legislation on electronic cigarettes, a categorical remark by a state representative caught our attention. Rep. Teresa Tanzi, D-South Kingstown, declared, "We have no idea what is contained in that vapor" when an e-cigarette is used. Is there really no information available to the public, as she seemed to suggest? Our exploration of her statement took us into the world of "vaping" -- the act of using an e-cigarette. An e-cigarette is a battery-powered nicotine delivery system that resembles a cigarette; it heats a liquid and turns it into a colorless, odorless vapor without combustion. Unlike puffing on a tobacco cigarette, the user inhales vapor, not smoke. The Assembly in June enacted a measure that would ban the sale of e-cigarettes to minors, but Governor Chafee vetoed it. He said the proposal would circumvent existing Rhode Island law on tobacco control and taxation. The Assembly has not scheduled any veto override session. It didn’t take us long to discover that, despite Tanzi’s assertion, there have been numerous scientific studies about the content of e-cigarette vapors. One of the leading voices in the national tug-of-war over e-cigarettes is Dr. Michael Siegel, a professor in the Department of Community Health Sciences at the Boston University School of Health, and a Brown University graduate. He co-authored a definitive academic paper in 2010 in the peer-reviewed Journal of Public Health Policy that reviewed the available science on e-cigarettes. He cited 16 studies, most of them sponsored by the industry, but all conducted by independent laboratories. The studies concluded that the primary components of the vapor are propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin and nicotine. Trace amounts of cancer-causing ingredients also have been detected. Of course, actual cigarettes are a known cause of cancer. Siegel pointed out that most e-cigarette users are former smokers or smokers who are trying to quit. "The issue is not finding out what’s in there. We know what’s in them," he said in an interview with The Journal. "The question is what are the long-term ramifications. And how do you weigh that against the risks of continuing to smoke." We telephoned Tanzi, who said that, in her comment during the House debate, she was referring to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulating tobacco but not e-cigarettes. As a result, she said, there are no government standards regarding the content of e-cigarettes and their possible secondhand effects. In the absence of such standards, Tanzi contended, e-cigarettes should not be sold to anyone. But that’s not what she said on the House floor. Nor is she quite right in her characterization of the FDA position. We contacted the FDA, whose web sites and spokeswoman told us that e-cigarettes are subject to regulation in two ways as the result of a federal court ruling -- as tobacco products and as therapeutic devices. Subject to regulation, in the case of tobacco products, does not mean they are actually regulated today. The FDA’s Jennifer Haliski said the agency has announced its intent to issue a proposed rule deeming products defined as e-cigarettes to be subject to regulation under the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. After the rule is adopted, she explained, the FDA will be able to exercise its authority over e-cigarettes as tobacco products. But Haliski said e-cigarettes are regulated by the FDA if a seller makes a therapeutic claim -- in other words, the seller boasts, as spelled out in the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, that "it treats or prevents disease or otherwise affects the structure or any function of the body . . ." So Tanzi is half-right when she says that the FDA does not regulate e-cigarettes. They are not regulated as a tobacco product but they are regulated as a drug device. No e-cigarette maker has yet applied to the FDA for approval of a therapeutic claim. When a maker does, Haliski said, the FDA will review the scientific evidence submitted and then rule. The agency has warned a handful of e-cigarette distributors about alleged unsubstantiated claims and alleged poor manufacturing practices. Haliski said that as an official matter, because manufacturers have not applied for approvals, backed with science, the FDA does not yet know what is in the vapor. In limited lab studies of certain samples, though, the FDA said it found mismatches between labeling and contents indicative of manufacturing quality problems. "We need more research," Haliski said. Our ruling State Rep. Teresa Tanzi said, "We have no idea what is contained in [electronic cigarette] vapor." But we found that numerous studies have identified the primary components of the vapor. Tanzi said she was referring to a lack of federal regulation of the products and the setting of safety standards. But that’s not what she said in the House debate. The judges rule her claim False.

pomt-09353	"If every house in Florida had a solar-heated water tank, that would eliminate consumption by 17 percent."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/apr/06/jeff-kottkamp/kottkamp-says-solar-water-heater/	In a race for the state attorney general, we'd usually expect to hear about consumer protection, fraud, and corruption. So we were surprised when Lt. Gov. Jeff Kottkamp, a Republican candidate for attorney general, brought up the question of energy efficiency in a recent interview with Newsmax TV, a conservative Web site. "If every house in Florida had a solar-heated water tank, that would eliminate consumption by 17 percent," said Kottkamp. He's right they would help. But would they help that much? According to the U.S. Department of Energy, solar water heaters are indeed a cost-effective way to generate hot water. Although they are generally more expensive to install than conventional systems, the cost is offset through long-term savings: On average, water heating bills drop by 50 to 80 percent. That also reduces carbon dioxide emissions. First, we contacted Kottkamp's campaign to ask about the source of their claim. A press representative told us that because water heating makes up anywhere from 17 to 20 percent of the utility bill, a solar water system would reduce our consumption by up to 20 percent. We checked a variety of sources to see how much water heating makes up of the average utility bill. We found a few different numbers, but for the most part, Kottkamp was in the ballpark. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, it's about 12 percent. An MSN Money article puts the figure between 14 and 20. The Western Area Power Administration says that it's 18 percent. But there's a flaw in Kottkamp's conclusion because he's assuming a solar heater would eliminate energy consumption. Kottkamp didn't note that most solar water heaters also require a back-up system, usually in the form of an electric or gas heater. And it takes energy to power them. Dan Olney, vice president of operations for Suntrek Industries, a California company that installs solar systems, said he tells customers that solar heating "can only supplement conventional water heating." That's why the Department of Energy says the reduction for water heating energy costs is more along the lines of 50 to 80 percent of the current cost. That means rather than the 17 percent savings Kottkamp cites, it could be as low as 8.5 percent. So Kottkamp's underlying point is correct, but he's overreaching with his conclusion that it would reduce energy costs 17 percent. According to the federal estimate, the actual savings could be only half of that -- as low as 8.5 percent of total energy costs. So we find his claim Half True.

pomt-06138	Says Mitt Romney raised business taxes 20 percent in Massachusetts.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/dec/22/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-governor-mitt-romney-raised-busine/	In a TV ad airing in Iowa, Rick Perry said Mitt Romney, "raised business taxes 20 percent" when he was governor of Massachusetts. That so? To back the claim, Perry’s presidential campaign noted an Oct. 1, 2011, New York Times article describing then-Gov. Romney, faced with a $3 billion state deficit, signing off on an aide’s 2003 proposal to ban a practice then enabling banks to reduce their state taxes. The banks were transferring billions of dollars in assets, such as mortgages, into real estate investment trusts that were, by design, subject to virtually no taxes, the Times recapped. And, according to the article, the state’s subsequent ban on that practice and other steps on Romney’s watch ultimately resulted in companies paying about $370 million a year in additional taxes, "a nearly 20 percent increase from the period before (Romney) took office." The story attributes that calculation to an analysis by the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, a research group that the newspaper said receives financing from corporations. Andrew Bagley, a foundation spokesman, told us in an interview that Massachusetts businesses paid $377 million more in taxes in fiscal 2007, which included several months of Romney’s last year as governor, than the $1.6 billion they were averaging annually before the recession that socked the state as Romney was sworn in during fiscal 2003. The state’s fiscal year runs from July through June. The $377 million increase shows up on a spreadsheet breaking down additional revenue generated for the state from 22 changes that took effect while Romney was governor. According to the spreadsheet, the closing of the real-estate investment loophole accounted for $50 million of the increased revenue, ranking second to a change related to interest and royalties that had yielded $58 million in added revenue as of 2007. Massachusetts "had an enormous hole to fill" due to the recession, Bagley said, adding that while there were complaints about the actions taken with Romney’s approval, "none of us could come up with a better way" of filling the hole "than having to raise some of that from revenues." Bagley said the spreadsheet originated with a state agency, the Massachusetts Department of Revenue. A bureau spokesman, Robert Bliss, confirmed as much and told us that foundation researchers are viewed as honest brokers. "I wouldn’t quarrel with their work," Bliss said. The cited figures -- the $377 million increase in business-paid taxes compared to the pre-recession business-paid tax base of $1.6 billion -- divides out to a nearly 24 percent increase. We noticed, though, that two changes listed on the spreadsheet weren’t borne, or at least entirely borne, by businesses. Those changes, including the interception of lottery winnings to pay a winner’s past-due taxes, accounted for $9 million of the increased revenues, reducing the increased load on businesses as of 2007 to $368 million -- a slight downgrade. Separately, we noticed a 2006 Cato Institute "report card" on the fiscal records of governors indicating that under Romney, Massachusetts tax rates did not increase. Is it fair to say Romney drove up business taxes, as Perry said? John Regan, spokesman for Associated Industries of Massachusetts, a pro-business group that represents employers, suggested in an interview that weighing changes in tax rates alone would be misleading. As governor, he said, Romney "adjusted the tax code under the guise of closing loopholes, the net effect of which was hundreds of millions of dollars in additional revenue, the bulk of that from business." Romney’s campaign did not reply to our inquiry about Perry’s statement. A Nexis search led us to an Oct. 15, 2007, letter to the editor of The Boston Globe from Eric Fehrnstrom, a Boston consultant then identified as a senior adviser to Romney’s 2008 presidential campaign. Fehrnstrom’s letter, reacting to a writer’s critique of Romney’s tax record, said corporate "loophole closings are not tax increases. They are an attempt to keep in check aggressive tax accounting." His letter also said that Romney balanced the state’s budget for four years "without raising taxes" and signed into law a commuter tax deduction, an investment tax credit, sales tax holidays, an expanded property tax break for seniors, a more generous research and development credit, a manufacturing tax rebate, a $250 million capital gains tax refund and a tax break for movie companies doing business in the Bay State. Our ruling By the time Romney’s term as governor was ending, Massachusetts businesses were ponying up about 20 percent more in tax revenue due to actions he approved. To be sure, those increases were not due to hikes in corporate or other tax rates. Still, Perry’s claim has a reasonable basis. We rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-07078	"The state’s tax burden has, according to census figures released today, cost our state another 190,000 residents in 2009."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jun/27/tom-kean-jr/state-sen-tom-kean-jr-says-new-jerseys-taxes-cause/	State Senate Minority Leader Tom Kean Jr. has taken aim at the New Jersey Supreme Court after its latest ruling in the state’s school funding saga. Kean (R-Union) criticized the justices for deciding that the state must dole out an additional $500 million to 31 low-income school districts and said the GOP won’t let taxpayers foot the bill. "Republicans have been clear: we will not raise taxes on the most highly taxed people in America to pay for another wrongheaded decision by the Supreme Court," Kean said in a news release on May 24. "The state’s tax burden has, according to census figures released today, cost our state another 190,000 residents in 2009." Is it true the state's famously high taxes are driving people away? PolitiFact New Jersey decided to check. Adam Bauer, a spokesman for the Senate Republicans, said Kean’s statement was partly based on a May 23 article in the Asbury Park Press. The story, citing new data from the U.S. Census Bureau, stated that nearly 190,000 New Jersey residents left the state in 2009. The story further explained that about 136,000 residents moved into New Jersey during the same period, creating an "estimated net loss of 53,744 residents out of 8.7 million." The statistics come from the Census Bureau’s 2009 American Community Survey on state-to-state migration. According to the data, 189,956 people moved from New Jersey to another state or Puerto Rico in 2009. During that time frame, 136,212 people moved into the state, for an estimated net loss of 53,744 residents. Because the numbers are from a survey, they are estimates. However, a survey statistician with the Census Bureau told us that the margins of error on the data aren’t large enough to significantly impact what the numbers show: New Jersey lost tens of thousands of residents in 2009. So, Kean got the number of New Jersey residents who left the state largely correct, but he did not account for the 136,212 people who moved here. Now, we need to determine how many New Jersey residents left because of high taxes. Bauer pointed us to a study by Boston College that found $70 billion in wealth left New Jersey from 2004 to 2008. The report attributed that loss of wealth more to the decline of wealthy households moving into New Jersey than the increase of wealthy households leaving the state. The report also found, through an analysis of federal data, that the two major reasons behind the moves were changes in employment and family matters. The report also covers a different time period than what Kean referenced. Bauer said Kean’s assertion about the tax burden "certainly wasn’t intended as a monolithic statement," and that any attempt to construe it as such "is just splitting hairs." He provided no other evidence to prove taxes drove tens of thousands of New Jerseyans out of the state. "The senator has known people" that left the state because of taxes, Bauer said. "Everyone has anecdotal evidence." "If you take issue with the [statement’s] wording," he said, "I apologize." Surveys by the pro-business Tax Foundation show that New Jersey’s tax burden is, well, burdensome. New Jersey takes seven spots on the Washington, D.C.-based group’s top 10 list of counties paying the highest median property taxes from 2005 to 2009. The group also ranks the state and local tax burden in New Jersey as the highest in the nation for 2009, the most recent year the group reviewed. But what impact did taxes have on the state’s population? American Community Survey data doesn’t include information on what motivated New Jersey residents to leave the state or what attracted out-of-state residents to move here. Nationwide, the Census Bureau found that more than 40 percent of people moved between 2009 and 2010 because of housing-related reasons, such as moving to a new home, about 30 percent cited family concerns and 16.4 percent said employment needs prompted their move. The agency doesn’t break down those numbers to the state level. So we asked some experts for their opinions. James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, said that while a "whole range of factors" go into a decision to move, "certainly New Jersey is an extraordinarily expensive place to live and taxes are part of that burden." "Whether it’s residential property taxes, sales taxes and the like, it does constitute a push factor," he said. Joseph J. Seneca, a professor at the Bloustein School who co-authored a 2007 study with Hughes that analyzed New Jersey migration patterns, said the number of residents moving out of state from New Jersey has dropped in recent years, an assertion supported by American Community Survey data from 2006 to 2009. He attributed the slowdown to the lack of job opportunities elsewhere and the collapse of the housing market. Still, he said, "certainly taxes in general affect people’s decision" to move, but the "causes are many and complex." "Taxes are definitely not the only factor. But they are one of the factors," said Mark Robyn, an economist with the Tax Foundation. "Some people want to live in a high-tax, high-service state." Douglas Massey, director of the Office of Population Research at Princeton University, co-authored a 2008 report on migration into and out of New Jersey. It found that low-income individuals impacted by New Jersey’s high cost of living were driving up the number of residents moving out of state. "It was more jobs and real estate than tax burden," Massey said. "New Jersey is a high-value, high-wealth state that attracts professionals," Massey said. "They are willing to pay the high taxes because of the amenities in the state of New Jersey." Now, let’s get back to Kean’s statement. Kean said that New Jersey’s tax burden pushed 190,000 residents out of the state in 2009. The figure matches estimates from the American Community Survey, but Kean ignores the tens of thousands of people who moved into the state during the same period. And even Kean's spokesman acknowledges that high taxes are not the sole reason residents left New Jersey. Bauer produced no solid evidence that even a substantial share of the approximately 190,000 people left because of taxes. It's a powerful line to claim that people are fleeing the state because of high taxes. But we find insufficient evidence it is true. We rate the claim False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-08213	"Rhode Island is one of only six states" to use E-Verify.	false	/rhode-island/statements/2010/nov/19/lincoln-chafee/chafee-says-only-six-states-use-e-verify/	Governor-elect Lincoln Chafee wasted no time telling constituents that he will make good on a campaign pledge to repeal Governor Carcieri's 2008 executive order on immigration. When it came to talking about one of the key components of that order, the use of the federal E-Verify system, he seemed a little vague on the details, however. "Don't forget, Rhode Island is one of only six states to have -- I believe it's only six -- to have E-Verify. So there's 44 other states that don't have it," Chafee told reporters after an unrelated news conference Monday. The point he was trying to make is that E-Verify is not a widely used program and one he believes may not be effective. We wondered how many states actually require use of E-Verify. But first, a little background. E-Verify is a free, federal database that compares information from a person's employment paperwork to Homeland Security and Social Security records. Employers who use the program can weed out immigrants not eligible to work in this country. Once employers hire workers, they run their names through the E-Verify database. If the records match, the new employees are eligible to work. If they don't match, the database notifies the employers, who must then give the worker eight days to provide sufficient proof of eligibility. What sounds like a foolproof system quickly came under fire. Critics complained that the database was inaccurate and demanded that it be improved before E-Verify was widely implemented. Despite that criticism, companies increasing began using the program on a voluntary basis. One by one, some states too started mandating E-Verify checks. In 2008, Rhode Island became one of them when Governor Donald Carcieri announced a multi-part executive order intended to curb illegal immigration. One of the key elements of the order required the state's executive branch and companies doing business with the state to use E-Verify for new employees. (The federal government began requiring use of E-Verify for government contractors in September 2009). Just how many states require the use of E-Verify? Contrary to what Chafee told reporters, the number is 13 -- 26 percent -- according to data from the U.S. Customs and Immigration Services. There are variations in how states employ E-Verify. Idaho, North Carolina and Virginia require E-Verify checks on state employees, while Colorado mandates that only state contractors use the system. Like Rhode Island, Georgia, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska and Oklahoma require both. Finally, Arizona, Mississippi and Utah mandate that all employers statewide use the program. (South Carolina requires employers to verify the legal status of their workers, either through E-Verify or by checking their drivers' licenses.) While those statistics make clear that Chafee has his facts wrong, we were inclined to give him a little leeway on this one, for a couple of reasons. First, he said he believed only six states used E-Verify, implying he didn't know for sure. And when Carcieri issued his well-publicized executive order, the number of states using E-Verify was closer to six. It has since increased. When asked about the discrepancy, Chafee's transition office explained the governor elect's statement this way: there are six other states besides Rhode Island that have E-Verify laws that are similar to ours, spokesman Christian Vareika said. So a state that actually has a more sweeping E-Verify policy than Rhode Island should not be included in the total because its program is more extensive? That logic escapes us. Vareika stressed what he called Chafee's larger point. "The vast majority of states do not use E-Verify, so I think the heart of the matter remains true," he said. But there is something else. This is not the first time Chafee has used the six-state figure. Back in June in a gubernatorial candidate forum, Chafee told the crowd: "I would not participate in E-Verify. Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Mississippi, Rhode Island and South Carolina - only six states participate. If it's so great, is that the kind of company we want? I don't think so." Why he arbitrarily cited those six states, we're not sure. We tend to give politicians a pass when they make one slip of the tongue. But not when they repeat incorrect information. In this case, after The Providence Journal quoted him on the "six states" in June, the candidate posted the story on his campaign website where it remained as of Nov. 18. Chafee has repeatedly condemned Carcieri's executive order and promised to repeal it once he takes office. In challenging such a controversial policy, he owed it to constituents on both sides of the debate to do his homework on the current laws before speaking out. We rate this False.

pomt-02600	"Obamacare passed by just one vote in the Senate. It wouldn’t have passed without Mark Warner’s vote."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2014/jan/27/ed-gillespie/gillespie-says-obamacare-wouldnt-have-passed-witho/	Republican Ed Gillespie opened his bid for the U.S. Senate this month by dropping responsibility for Obamacare on the toes of incumbent Democrat Mark Warner. Gillespie -- a former chairman of the Republican National Committee and former advisor to President George W. Bush -- announced his candidacy on Jan. 16. Five days later, he launched a web ad featuring 2009 video snippets of Gillespie criticizing Obamacare and Warner defending it. The screen turns black and these words appear: "Obamacare passed by just one vote in the Senate. It wouldn’t have passed without Mark Warner’s vote." We explored whether Warner’s vote was essential to passage of the health care package. Paul Logan, a spokesman for Gillespie, said the claim is based on a vote Warner cast in 2009 to prevent a Senate filibuster on Obamacare. Under the Senate’s cloture rules, it takes 60 votes in the 100-member chamber to end debate on most types of legislation and allow an up or down vote on the bill. On Dec. 23, 2009, the Senate voted 60-39 to halt debate on Obamacare. Warner joined all of his fellow Democrats and two independents in voting to stop a threatened Republican filibuster. The next day, the Senate passed Obamacare with an identical 60-39 vote. But Warner’s vote wasn’t as important this time because only a simple majority was required to approve the legislation. We should note that Warner is hardly the first Democratic senator to be attacked for his or her vote to end the filibuster. Republicans have charged each of at least four other Democrats with casting "the deciding vote." In Virginia last November, then-Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli claimed Warner cast "the tie-breaking vote" to pass Obamacare. PolitiFact’s standard ruling on those claims has been Mostly False. We, and our colleagues in other states, have said it’s misleading to accuse one senator of casting the pivotal ballot when the same could be said of 59 others who voted to end the filibuster. Our ruling Gillespie says "Obamacare passed by one vote in the Senate. It wouldn’t have passed without Mark Warner’s vote." This is an improvement on past Republican efforts to blame Warner for casting the deciding vote to block a filibuster against Obamacare when, in fact, he was joined by 59 colleagues. It casts Warner as part of a collective weight that tipped the scales -- not the final grain of sand. Warner was one of 60 who voted to block the filibuster -- the bare number required under Senate rules. That allowed the Senate the following day to vote on the Obamacare bill and here’s where Gillespie’s statement comes up a little bit short. The bill, with Warner’s support, passed by a 60-39 vote. But since it only required a simple majority in the 100-member Senate to approve the legislation, Warner’s vote was not essential this time around. The actual Obamacare bill would have passed with or without him. So Gillespie’s statement is largely accurate but needs a technical clarification. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-05248	"We’ve seen property taxes go down for the first time in 12 years on a median valued home."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jun/01/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-first-time-12-years-property/	Defending his fiscal policies and collective bargaining limits during the final debate before the June 5, 2012 recall vote, Gov. Scott Walker put property tax relief near the top of his bragging list. "We’ve seen property taxes go down for the first time in 12 years on a median valued home," Walker said during the WISN-TV debate at the Marquette University Law School. Is his claim on the money? Walker’s office pointed to the annual estimates from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. Those reports show an upward trend in the property tax bill for a median-valued home, from 2000 to 2010. Some years it was close to flat; the year-to-year increases ranged from a tiny 0.1 percent to 4.6 percent. This leads us to 2011, the first year under Walker and his budget’s tight limits on local property tax increases. Those caps included a virtual freeze on the ability of local governments to increase the tax levy. In preliminary estimates during the budget process, the Fiscal Bureau projected the median residential bill would go up. But Walker’s administration -- using actual figures reported by schools and municipal governments -- announced in April 2012 that the bill for a median-priced home in 2011 saw a 0.4 percent drop. To be sure, that doesn’t mean every homeowner’s bill went down, just that a median-valued home would see a small drop. The approach is simply a way of roughly measuring year-to-year changes. While Walker’s claim appears on target, the overall amount of property taxes collected in the state will likely go up a bit, not down. The reason: Walker is using a typical residential home, not looking at the total of all residential collections, and his figures does not include commercial and agricultural property. The Fiscal Bureau is still checking the administration’s math and fine-tuning the numbers, but so far the data clearly supports a decrease, said Fred Ammerman, the Fiscal Bureau’s property tax program supervisor. So, the fact the numbers are not final adds a note of caution to the mix. But the figure Walker cited is a commonly used benchmark that last dropped from 1999 to 2000. And he made it clear he was talking about just residential property. We rate Walker’s claim Mostly True.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2012-06-01T14:17:31	2012-05-31	['None']
pomt-12683	On whether or not the Philadelphia DA's office will recommend the possibility of parole for all juvenile lifers.	full flop	/pennsylvania/statements/2017/mar/16/seth-williams/tracking-district-attorney-seth-williams-shifting-/	Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams took to the opinion pages of The Philadelphia Inquirer last week to defend himself from criticism that he reversed his stance on the individuals who have been deemed "juvenile lifers" in the criminal justice system. Williams, a Democrat who is finishing out his second term as district attorney and will not seek re-election, apparently took issue with an early March Inquirer piece that indicated the DA had changed his previous stance on offering the chance of parole to those convicted of homicide when they were juveniles. In the piece, the Inquirer reported Williams and his staff intend to seek sentences of life without parole for at least three of the 300 Philadelphia juvenile lifers whose sentences are under review. The district attorney wrote in that letter to the editor published last week that "the article is contradicted by the paper's prior reporting" and that his "approach to these cases is fair, reasonable, and consistent with the judgments of the Pennsylvania legislature and the U.S. Supreme Court." So did Williams reverse his stance or not? We decided to put it to the test on our Flip-O-Meter, which specifically tracks whether politicians have gone back on their promises. Let’s look first at what Williams’ stance on juvenile lifers was, and why it’s been of interest over the last several years. In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Miller v. Alabama that it’s a violation of the Eighth Amendment for states to require a sentence of life without the possibility of parole for individuals convicted of committing homicide before they turned 18. The court ruled those sentences should be "uncommon" and reserved for "the rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable corruption." By the end of 2012, the Pennsylvania legislature passed new sentencing requirements for juveniles convicted of first- or second-degree murder, ranging from a 20-years-to-life sentence to a 35-years-to-life sentence, depending on degree and how old the person was when the crime was committed. That new legislation applied only to new sentences handed down after the Miller decision. But things got complicated last year when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Miller v. Alabama decision to prohibit mandatory sentences of life without the possibility of parole for juveniles would apply retroactively. That set off a chaotic process in the criminal justice system that’s being resolved by district attorneys, judges and criminal defense attorneys across the state resentencing individuals according to new requirements, but largely leaving it up to judge’s discretion to make a final determination on each individual. There were about 480 juvenile lifers across the state system; 300 of those are from Philadelphia. Last summer, Williams said in an Inquirer interview that it was his goal "to give all of these individuals some light at the end of the tunnel." "As long as I'm the D.A.," he said, "we will not be asking for cases going forward for life without the possibility of parole for people under the age of 18 because of the same exact reasons articulated by the Supreme Court in Miller." The promise earned Williams praise from progressive groups, and he was even lauded in a New York Times editorial that ended with: "Now that Mr. Williams has put that principle into practice, district attorneys in other counties with large numbers of juvenile lifers have a clearer path to follow." In the same Inquirer interview from last year, Williams said "I've got a lot of people who are tweeting every day about juvenile lifers without parole." Some of them he even responded to. On June 3, 2016, the district attorney tweeted to someone asking questions about his policy: "we will have hearings for all 300 chronologically they will get new sentences that will allow for the possibility of parole." He even doubled down when the person responded, asking: "does that mean the Philly DAs office will not seek LWOP (life without parole) in any of those 300 cases?" Williams tweeted back: "just keep reading my last tweet." So at the beginning of this month, the Inquirer wrote that it appeared Williams’ stance had shifted. Journalist Samantha Melamed reported Williams’ office, in a letter to a federal court, indicated it intends to seek life without parole in at least three of the cases it had reviewed so far. Officials from Williams’ office confirmed that this week, saying it’s so far made 96 offers, three of which were for life without parole. They refused to provide any information about those three cases, saying the offers are still under consideration by defense attorneys and the final determination will be made by a judge. The Inquirer reported one of the individuals who the DA’s office is recommending life without parole for is Andre Martin, who was 15 when he shot and killed police officer John Trettin in 1976. From the story: "According to Inquirer coverage from 1976, Martin had an IQ of 80 and was high on Valium and marijuana when he shot a police officer through the window of an apartment in a public-housing project." Following that March Inquirer story about Williams’ apparent shifting stance, Williams wrote in a letter to the editor that there was no change in his stance and quoted the Inquirer’s original June 2016 piece that read: "[Williams] said he won't rule out life without parole in the most heinous cases, but he has taken heed of the Supreme Court's opinion, in Miller, that neuroscience shows teens' brains are not fully formed, reducing their culpability." Melamed said the Inquirer stands by its reporting, which is "why the district attorney’s claim appeared in the form of a letter to the editor rather than a correction." Williams’ chief of staff Kathleen Martin said in an interview this week that "he hopes or expects not to have a lot of murderers who were juveniles remain, but in certain circumstances, including heinous crimes, that might in fact happen." She described the office’s process for reviewing each of the juvenile lifer cases, saying it’s assigned a team of assistant district attorneys and other stakeholders to review every case, starting with the oldest ones. They’re seeking out surviving family members of victims, combing through old case files and reviewing information from the Department of Corrections about how the inmates have operated in prison. After that process, the team determined that they’ll request life in prison without the chance of parole for at least three juvenile lifers from Philadelphia. When PolitiFact asked Martin, Williams’ chief of staff, about whether or not this move conflicts with Williams’ past statements saying "all" 300 individuals would have a chance at parole, she said the three inmates in question still do have that chance because "the judge is always going to have a final determination." But that would go against what the DA’s office is requesting. Martin also said Williams’ original quote to the Inquirer that he wanted "to give all of these individuals some light at the end of the tunnel" was referring to his goals "moving forward" in sentencing new juveniles. "It’s clear that the DA had a goal, but in the most heinous occasions, that goal cannot always be met," Martin said. "There are just unfortunately some cases in which the best interest of the community at large is that certain people remain in custody." Our ruling District Attorney Seth Williams told The Philadelphia Inquirer last year that it was his goal "to give all of these individuals some light at the end of the tunnel" when it comes to re-sentencing juvenile lifers still in the Pennsylvania prison system. His office says he made clear there could be exceptions in the most heinous cases. That’s why Williams’ team contends his stance didn’t shift when it didn’t offer the chance of parole to three individuals so far as it continues the process of reviewing 300 cases of juvenile lifers in Pennsylvania. But we keep going back to when he tweeted that "we will have hearings for all 300 chronologically" and that "they will get new sentences that will allow for the possibility of parole." He then doubled down on that stance when asked directly about it on Twitter. The district attorney also indicated he agreed with the Miller decision, and wouldn’t seek life without parole for juveniles convicted of homicide moving forward. That’s since changed for at least three people who could remain in prison for life without the possibility of parole. We rate this a Full Flop.

pomt-09635	A Medicaid provision added to the Senate health care reform bill "is not a special deal for Nebraska."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/dec/23/ben-nelson/sen-ben-nelson-says-medicaid-provision-added-healt/	It has been called the "Omaha Stakes" and the "Cornhusker Kickback," but was a Medicaid provision added to the Senate health care bill a simple payoff to Nebraska to secure Sen. Ben Nelson's pivotal vote? That was the charge from several Republicans who blasted Nelson, D-Neb., for essentially selling his vote on health care reform in exchange for a special, backroom deal that could save the Nebraska state government millions of dollars in Medicaid subsidies. Nelson came to the floor on Dec. 22, 2009, to defend himself, and accused his attackers of distorting the facts to score political points. "It is not a special deal for Nebraska," Nelson said. We decided to weigh in. At issue here is a tiny clause tucked into a 383-page Manager's Amendment to the Senate health care reform bill. The wording of the paragraph is steeped in legalese (you can read the part that pertains to Nebraska on page 98 if you're into that kind of thing), but it relates to money that states will have to pick up with regard to Medicaid. The Senate bill would expand Medicaid to people below 133 percent of the poverty level. And up until 2017, the federal government will pick up the tab for the added cost that will place on state governments. After that, states will have to start sharing the cost. The provision added in the amendment will exempt Nebraska from that sunset, however, meaning that the federal government would forevermore pick up all of the expense of expanded eligibility to Medicaid in that state. How much money is at stake? The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office didn't specifically break out Nebraska, but said the cost of expanding Medicaid eligibility would be about $1.2 billion for Nebraska, Massachusetts and Vermont over the next 10 years. "You’ve got to compliment Ben Nelson for playing 'The Price is Right,'" said Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C. "He negotiated a Medicaid agreement for Nebraska that puts the federal government on the hook forever. Not for six years, not for 10 years. This isn’t the Louisiana Purchase; this is the Nebraska windfall." Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., went on the Today show and called the deal "sleazy." And Attorney General Henry McMaster of South Carolina said he and his counterparts in Michigan and Washington state were investigating whether the special provisions for Nebraska are unconstitutional. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid defended the deal, saying, "You’ll find a number of states that are treated differently than other states. That’s what legislating is all about. It’s about compromise." On the Senate floor, Sen. Mike Johanns, R-Neb., said Nebraskans have been embarrassed by all the attention from the controversy and want no part of a special deal. Shortly after Johanns spoke, Nelson came to the floor to defend himself. The provision, he said, was not a "carve-out" for Nebraska. To the contrary, he said, he pushed for the language because he opposes unfunded mandates placed on states by the federal government -- such as this Medicaid expansion -- and saw the exemption for Nebraska as a way to open the door for other states to do the same. "You can twist and you can turn and you can try to distort what happens, but it does not change the underlying facts," Nelson said. "The underlying facts are, this was pursued initially as an opt-in or opt-out for all states. It was impossible to do that at the present time, and so as a matter of fix, there was, in fact, the extension of the federal dollars from the year 2017 on, well into the future, as a marker to lay down so that every state could object to this manner of unfunded mandates." "Each state between now and 2017 — two-thirds-plus of a decade — will have an opportunity to come back in and get this bill changed," Nelson said. "It is not a special deal for Nebraska," Nelson insisted. "It is, in fact, an opportunity to get rid of an unfunded federal mandate for all the states. Let me repeat that: for all the states. There is nothing special about it, and it is fair." Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, agreed that while the provision only mentions Nebraska, it may set a precedent for other states to get the same deal. '"Other governors will be on their congressmen and senators to make sure their states are held harmless," Harkin said. '"Sen. Nelson may have done all the states a big favor." So to summarize, Nelson says the provision was meant as a "marker" to allow all states to fight what he believes is an unfair, unfunded mandate from the federal government. And maybe that's the effect the provision will have. Maybe it will open the door so that in the next seven years, other states will be able to change the law so that they can get the same deal as Nelson got for Nebraska. But for now, Nebraska is the only state in the bill that would get the deal. Other states may fight in the future, but Nelson has already won that battle for Nebraska. And unless or until all states get the same treatment, it is a special deal for Nebraska. We rule Nelson's statement False.	None	Ben Nelson	None	None	None	2009-12-23T17:55:50	2009-12-22	['Nebraska']
pomt-04112	Members of Congress can "retire with the same pay after only one term" in office	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2013/jan/11/chain-email/can-members-congress-retire-full-pay-after-just-on/	Political trends come and go, but the classics endure. Such is the case with a chain email PolitiFact Ohio received to start the new year. When we received a nearly identical version a couple of years ago, we said it could be "a new classic of the genre." The email claims that Congress gets special perks nobody else does; complains that a complacent media ignores the news, and requests that recipients of the email forward it on to 20 more people. We examined one of the special perks mentioned in the email, that "the staffers of Congress family members are exempt from having to pay back student loans." The claim is confusingly worded, but we assumed that it referred to relatives of members of Congress and Congressional staffers. We gave the statement a rating of Pants on Fire because it was (and is) ridiculously false. Relatives of members of Congress and Congressional staffers have to pay back their loans like everyone else. But the still-circulating email contains another claim that several readers have asked about in recent days: that members of Congress can "retire with the same pay after only one term." This claim is a classic in its own right. Our friends at the urban legend checker Snopes.com say it has been circulating in various chain emails since at least 2000. The claim means that rank-and-file members of the House of Representatives would receive full pay of $174,000 per year, for the rest of their lives, after serving as little as two years. Nice work if you can get it. But members of Congress can't. A report on "Retirement Benefits for Members of Congress," prepared in November by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, outlines how pension benefits are calculated. The key provision: no member of Congress is eligible for any pension unless he or she has served in Congress for at least five years. (Senators serve six-year terms; House members must seek reelection every two years.) To collect, a congressman or senator must be age 62, or be at least age 50 with 20 years of service, or be any age with 25 years of service. Under the most recent pension program, adopted in 1984, the size of a pension is based on the highest three years of a member's salary, the number of years of service and a multiplier, which is 1.7 percent for the first 20 years of service and 1.0 percent for subsequent years. Here’s an example, using a typical 25-year rank-and-file member who retired this year. The pension would be the sum of two calculations. First, multiply $172,443 [the average salary over the last three years] times 20 years times 0.017. Then, multiply $172,443 times 5 years times 0.01 and add that number to the first calculation. The total: about $67,250 per year. A three-term congressman (or one-term senator) who has now reached retirement age would be eligible for an annual pension of $17,588 for six years of work. That's generous, but not close to full pay. Federal law prevents members of Congress from getting full-pay retirement when they leave office. The report says, "By law, the starting amount of a member's retirement annuity may not exceed 80 percent of his or her final salary." Under the formula, it would take 67 years of service to hit that limit. So the email saying that members of Congress can "receive full pay retirement after serving one term" is blatantly bogus. It's never full pay and the only one-term members who would be eligible for any pension would be senators. Snopes.com rated the pension claim as False. Our colleagues at FactCheck.org have also debunked the claim -- which, over the years, has been accompanied by assertions that members of Congress don't pay into their Social Security (they have since 1984) or that they don't contribute anything toward their retirement (they do). For a bogus claim that’s been circulating at least 13 years, and for anyone who still spreads it, we’ll break out the matches. Pants on Fire!

pomt-04805	"Under the president's plan, he cuts Medicare by $716 billion, takes that money out of the Medicare trust fund and uses it to pay for Obamacare."	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/aug/20/mitt-romney/romney-says-obama-cuts-716-medicare-pay-obamacare/	Florida has become the battleground where Mitt Romney and Barack Obama are dueling over Medicare. Romney’s favorite attack line: Obama took $716 billion from Medicare to pay for Obamacare. Romney made the claim in an Aug. 15, 2012, one-on-one interview with Tampa Bay’s WTSP 10 News. "Under the president's plan, he cuts Medicare by $716 billion, takes that money out of the Medicare trust fund and uses it to pay for Obamacare," Romney said. "I think this is something that people are just now focused on and find it very, very difficult to understand why he would cut Medicare for our current seniors." Romney’s been repeating that number a lot lately. Is it accurate? And was the money moved to pay for the national health care law? Neither Obama nor his health care law literally cut funding from the Medicare program’s budget. Rather, the health care law instituted a number of changes to try to bring down future health care costs in the program. What kind of spending reductions are we talking about? They were mainly aimed at insurance companies and hospitals, not beneficiaries. The law made significant reductions to Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. Medicare Advantage was started under President George W. Bush, and the idea was that competition among the private insurers would reduce costs. But the plans have actually cost more than traditional Medicare. So the health care law scales back the payments to private insurers. Hospitals, too, will be paid less if they have too many re-admissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care. Obama and fellow Democrats say the intention is to protect beneficiaries' coverage while forcing health care providers to become more efficient. Romney has said he will repeal the health care law and institute a new overhaul of Medicare that brings more private insurers into a competitive marketplace. Beneficiaries would receive "premium support," a voucher-like credit, to buy their own plan. We should point out that the overall Medicare budget is projected to go up for the foreseeable future, even with the health care law’s cost-saving measures. The law tries to limit the program’s growth, though, making it less than it would have been without the law, but not reducing its overall budget. So claims that Obama would "cut" Medicare need more explanation to be fully accurate. In the past, we’ve rated similar statements Half True or Mostly False, depending on the wording and context. If you’ve been following the Medicare debate for awhile, you may have heard previous claims that Obama cut Medicare by $500 billion. How did that become $700 billion? Because Medicare spending gets bigger every year, the cost-saving mechanisms in the health care law also get bigger. And, it takes a few years for the health care law’s savings mechanisms to kick in. In fact, the effects of time are the main reason the $500 billion number has turned into $700 billion. The CBO determined in 2011 that the federal health care law would reduce Medicare outlays by $507 billion between 2012 and 2021. Ina more recent estimate released this year, the CBO looked at the years 2013 to 2022 and determined the health care law affected Medicare outlays by $716 billion. So it’s timing that’s making the cuts bigger, not changes to Medicare. Romney also send that the spending reduction " takes that money out of the Medicare trust fund and uses it to pay for Obamacare." Romney has a point here, but it’s not about money being moved from one account to another. Let us explain. At the time the health care law was being finalized and passed, Democrats said it was important to them that the new law not add to the deficit. So the reductions in Medicare spending were counted against the health care law’s new spending. Some new spending is within the Medicare program, such as increasing coverage for prescription drugs and offering preventive care with no out-of-pocket costs. More significantly, though, the law moves to cover the uninsured, by giving them tax credits to buy private insurance. It also expands Medicaid, the state insurance program for the poor. The savings from Medicare offset that spending. We should note that the health law also imposes new taxes, primarily on the wealthy and on the health care industry. That too offsets the new spending. Our ruling Romney said, "Under the president's plan, he cuts Medicare by $716 billion, takes that money out of the Medicare trust fund and uses it to pay for Obamacare." This wording isn't as troublesome as other statements we've seen on this topic, including from Romney himself. Still, Romney's most-recent attempt at this claim needs significantly more explanation. In this instance, Romney’s claim gives the impression that the law takes money that was already allocated to Medicare and funds the new health care law with it. In fact, the law uses a number of measures to try to reduce the rapid growth of future Medicare spending. Those savings are then used to offset costs created by the law -- especially coverage for the uninsured -- so that the overall law doesn't add to the deficit. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-01472	On support for the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).	full flop	/florida/statements/2014/sep/30/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-has-changed-positions-several-times-/	Charlie Crist’s gubernatorial campaign has been peppered by Republicans claiming he’s changed positions on a number of issues, but perhaps the most cited is his position on the Affordable Care Act. A campaign commercial from the Republican Party of Florida says his change of heart on Obamacare is "flippin’ amazing," showing that he first wanted to repeal the law, but now is for it. We decided to put Crist’s position on the health care law to our Flip-O-Meter to see whether he’s had a true change of heart. The charge has dogged him since he ran for Senate in 2010 -- at one time, opponent Marco Rubio accused him of having "six different positions" on the health care law. We rated that Half True, because we really counted three. Crist said in the 2010 race he wanted to repeal the law, but he has also said he wanted to modify the law, and he currently supports the Affordable Care Act as a Democrat. The commercial cites a March 28, 2010, debate on Fox News with Rubio in which Crist says, "I think what we need to do is go ahead and repeal this thing," referring to the health care law. It then changes to a March 9, 2014, interview with CNN’s Candy Crowley, saying "I think it’s been great" when asked about the law. We found that Crist called for repeal in a March 21, 2010, Associated Press article while the U.S. House was voting on the bill. At that time, he was trying to win the Republican primary against Rubio. By July 20, when he had given up on the Republican nomination and was running as an independent, Crist was backing off of that position. The Wall Street Journal wrote that "Despite pledging as a Republican to help repeal President Obama's health-care overhaul, Mr. Crist now says he does not support such a move." Then on July 29, Crist issued a press release that seemed to take two positions at once. It read, in part: "Had I been in the United States Senate at the time, I would have voted against the bill because of unacceptable provisions like the cuts to the Medicare Advantage program. But being an independent, I have the freedom to be an honest broker for the people of Florida without regard for political party, and the reality is this: despite its serious flaws, the Obama health care bill does have some positive aspects. Repeal must be accompanied by a responsible substitute -- repeal without passage of a substitute law protecting those with pre-existing conditions, closing the prescription drug donut hole for seniors, and allowing parents to keep their children on their insurance coverage until age 26 would be wrong. While I would not have supported the legislation, we have to recognize the positive components and work together across party lines to make our health care system more affordable for both consumers and the government." So, he would have voted against it, but was now part of the repeal and replace crowd. But we’re not done yet. On Aug. 27, he told Central Florida News 13, "I would have voted for it but I think it can be done better." So he was saying he would have helped pass the law, but focused the rest of the conversation on how he didn’t like provisions for Medicare. Two hours later, he issued a press release that basically repeated the July 29 release, saying he wanted to "be abundantly clear." Crist ended up losing that Senate race as an independent, but once Crist became a Democrat, his position did a complete 180-degree turn for good. In the March 2014 interview with Crowley, Crist said the law was "great" and that Democratic candidates should be more vocal in supporting the law. "They ought to strengthen up," he said. "The president's a smart guy and he's doing the right thing, and God bless him for it." Our ruling As a Republican, Crist was clear in his adherence to the party line by saying the Affordable Care Act should be repealed. When running for Senate, he seemed to contradict himself at times by saying he would have voted against the law, but also that it should be repealed or modified. Then he said he would have voted for Obamacare, but wanted parts of it changed, specifically portions dealing with cuts to Medicare. In this campaign, he clearly supports the Affordable Care Act. That’s about as big a flip as you can get from saying he wouldn’t have voted for it in the first place. We rate this one a Full Flop.

pomt-04144	Among Milwaukee Public Schools students, "86 percent are behind in reading and 80 percent are behind in math."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jan/02/don-pridemore/4-5-milwaukee-public-schools-students-behind-readi/	Tagging himself a common-sense conservative reformer, Wisconsin state Rep. Don Pridemore, R-Erin, aims to unseat first-term state Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Evers in the April 2013 election. In announcing his run Dec. 3, 2012, Pridemore criticized school performance, taking particular aim at the district in Wisconsin’s largest city, Milwaukee Public Schools. The eight-year suburban lawmaker said "86 percent of MPS students are behind in reading and 80 percent are behind in math." Milwaukee Public Schools is a popular target. But are the vast majority of its students lagging in reading and math? Pridemore’s evidence When we asked Pridemore to back up his claim, he cited an Oct. 24, 2012, article in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. The article reported on recalculations done by the Department of Public Instruction, the agency Evers heads, on a statewide student tests. The recalculations were done on 2011 scores for the Wisconsin Knowledge and Concepts Examination, which is given each fall. As the Journal Sentinel explained, DPI raised expectations for performance to match those of a respected national exam. The recalibration meant that essentially overnight, there was a large increase in the number of students who were rated as non-proficient -- even though their performance on the test didn’t change. Statewide, under the old standard for scoring the 2011 WKCE tests, 18 percent of students failed to score as proficient or advanced in reading. But the figure rose to 64 percent under the new standard. In math, the non-proficiency figure rose from 22 percent under the old standard to 52 percent under the new. Milwaukee Public Schools students fared worse. Under the old standard, nearly 42 percent of MPS students were scored as not proficient in reading. But under the new standard, the figure climbed to 86 percent. In math, nearly 41 percent of MPS students were rated as not proficient under the old standard. That rose to just over 80 percent under the new standard. Milwaukee Public Schools spokesman Tony Tagliavia acknowledged the accuracy of the figures, but pointed out that the percentages of students in Milwaukee voucher, or choice, schools rated as not proficient were even higher in reading (90 percent) and math (88 percent). He said it was important to cite the performance of private schools that get public funding since they are "pitched as the solution to issues with MPS." But we’re not testing a claim about voucher schools -- we’re testing Pridemore’s claim about MPS students’ proficiency in reading and math. Our rating Pridemore said that among Milwaukee Public Schools students, "86 percent are behind in reading and 80 percent are behind in math." We would note that the figures are as high as they not because of a change in student performance, but a change in the way the state scores a test. Nevertheless, Pridemore states the figures accurately and we rate his statement True.	None	Don Pridemore	None	None	None	2013-01-02T09:00:00	2012-12-03	['None']
pomt-08316	"Rigell's car dealership made over $400,000 off the ‘Cash for Clunkers’ bailout."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2010/oct/29/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/dccc-says-scott-rigells-car-dealership-made-over-4/	An arm of the national Democratic Party labeled Virginia Beach businessman and Congressional hopeful Scott Rigell a hypocrite for criticizing federal stimulus spending after cashing in on its benefits. Rigell, a Republican, owns Freedom Automotive, which operates three dealerships in Hampton Roads. He’s challenging Democratic incumbent Glenn Nye for Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District seat. A TV ad sponsored by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee paints Rigell’s participation in the Cash for Clunkers program as a direct contradiction of his campaign criticism of the stimulus bill, which helped pay for the program. "Hypocrisy. That’s politics these days. And now politician Scott Rigell is campaigning on his opposition to bailouts," the ad says. "But Rigell's car dealership made over $400,000 off the 'Cash for Clunkers' bailout. Rigell rails against the bailout, but his business raked in the cash." Asked to source the claim, the DCCC pointed to U.S. Department of Transportation statistics as well as stories in The Daily Press and The Virginian-Pilot, daily newspapers in Hampton Roads. But first, what is Cash for Clunkers? The 33-day program during the summer of 2009 provided federal subsidies for people trading in older cars to buy new vehicles. The hope was to jump start the auto industry in the midst of the recession. Did Rigell’s dealerships participate in Cash for Clunkers? Yep. Rigell acknowledges it, and according to the U.S. Department of Transportation National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Rigell’s three dealerships received a total of $441,000 in rebates for 106 sales. But that doesn’t mean the rebates translated into $441,000 in profits for Rigell’s dealerships, as the ad implies. Under the program, dealers gave consumers instant instant rebates of up $4,500 for their clunkers to be used as down payments on new cars. The dealers would then file paperwork with the federal government and get reimbursed. Rigell’s profit would have come from the mark ups of the 106 new cars he sold under the program. Rigell’s campaign declined to reveal its mark-up figures. In 2009, U.S. auto dealers grossed an average $1,183 on on each new car sold, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association. Under that math, Rigell would have had a gross profit $125,398 attributable to Cash for Clunkers. Why woulda Republican who has vocally opposed the stimulus bill opt to participate in one of its programs? Rigell says it was just business. "Some of our customers asked to participate in that program and I couldn’t imagine saying no, you’ve got to go somewhere else," Rigell said at a recent Hampton RoadsChamber of Commerce meeting. Through a spokesman, Rigell told PolitiFact that he was protecting his 240 employees by participating. Although he made money from the program, Rigell says he is not happy about it. "I resentthe government for putting our family business in that position," he said. In The Virginian-Pilot, Rigell described the clunkers program as "an ill-advised program forced upon me as a businessman in this environment." So let’s look back at the facts. Rigell has indeed campaigned against the federal stimulus, as the ad claims. There’s no doubt that Cash for Clunkers was part of the stimulus and that the program boosted the bottom lines of Riggell’s dealerships. But we can’t place a dollar amount on the benefit to Rigell. The ad wrongly suggests that his dealerships’ $441,000 in rebates were straight profits and there’s reason to believe Rigell’s actual gain from Clunkers was considerably smaller. So we find the claim to be Half True.	None	Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee	None	None	None	2010-10-29T22:45:18	2010-10-01	['None']
pomt-10046	"Putting three Republicans in my Cabinet...is unprecedented."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/feb/10/barack-obama/Three-Republicans-Cabinet-Most/	UPDATE: This claim was accurate when President Obama said it. As you can see below in the original item, it is indeed unprecedented to have three Cabinet members from the opposite party. The circumstances changed on Feb. 12, 2009, three days after Obama's statement, when Sen. Gregg withdrew . But because we rule on statements based on the wording and timing of statements, we're keeping this one as a True. Obama was correct when he said it on Feb. 9, for the way he said it. So far, the votes on the massive economic stimulus package have fallen starkly along partisan lines. The bill that passed the House didn't get a single Republican vote, and the version that passed the Senate got a grand total of three. During a news conference on Feb. 9, 2009, in which President Obama made his case for the stimulus plan, he was asked if pressing forward despite Republican objections meant the White House is moving away from its emphasis on bipartisanship. "You know, when I made a series of overtures to the Republicans — going over to meet with both Republican caucuses; you know, putting three Republicans in my Cabinet, something that is unprecedented; making sure that they were invited here to the White House to talk about the economic recovery plan — all those were not designed simply to get some short-term votes," Obama said. "They were designed to try to build up some trust over time. And I think that as I continue to make these overtures, over time hopefully that will be reciprocated." We decided to check out whether Obama can accurately claim that his three Republican Cabinet appointments represent a bipartisan high-water mark in presidential history. For starters, we're going to give Obama three Republicans, though a stickler could point out that Defense Secretary Robert Gates isn't actually registered as a Republican. But he's Republican enough in our book. Gates has served under several Republican administrations, and though he dropped his party registration to present an apolitical appearance while with the CIA, Gates himself said in December, "I consider myself a Republican." The other two Obama appointees are card-carrying Republicans: Ray LaHood, a former congressman from Illinois, as secretary of transportation; and Sen. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire as commerce secretary (though he has not yet been confirmed). And Obama is right. No other president has had this many. For a little perspective, here's a rundown of the crossovers from a century's worth of presidential Cabinets: • George W. Bush: Democrat Norman Mineta, transportation secretary. • Bill Clinton: Republican William Cohen, defense secretary. • George H. W. Bush: nada. • Ronald Reagan: William Bennett was a Democrat when appointed as education secretary in 1985, but the following year, he became a Republican and has remained a conservative Republican voice ever since. • Jimmy Carter: Republican James Schlesinger, who served as defense secretary under Republican presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, was tapped by Carter as America's first energy secretary. • Richard Nixon: Daniel Patrick Moynihan served as ambassador to the United Nations, which at the time was not a Cabinet-level position. • John F. Kennedy: Republicans C. Douglas Dillon as treasury secretary and Robert McNamara as defense secretary. McNamara wasn't such a stretch though, as Time m agazine pointed out at the time, "In politics, McNamara is a lukewarm, liberal Republican who often contributes to Democratic candidates. This year he voted for Kennedy." • Dwight D. Eisenhower: Democrat and Labor Secretary Martin Patrick Durkin, the "plumber" among Eisenhower's so called "Nine Millionaires and a Plumber" Cabinet. Durkin was replaced in 1953 by fellow Democrat James P. Mitchell, a so-called "Democrat-for-Eisenhower." • Franklin D. Roosevelt: Republicans Frank Knox as secretary of the Navy and Henry Stimson, secretary of war. "Nobody's got three," said presidential historian Richard Shenkman. "This is unprecedented." Shenkman doesn't think you'll be hearing much from the secretaries of transportation or commerce any time soon — those Cabinet secretaries typically take a lower profile — but the appointment of Gates, he said, is "highly significant." "I wouldn't call it tokenism," Shenkman said. "I think it's real. He (Obama) is making some kind of an effort there. And it comes at very little cost. It's a shrewd political move." But Terry Sullivan, associate professor of political science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, called the Obama appointments little more than political symbolism. "The real question is not whether it's true or false (that Obama has appointed an unprecedented number of Republicans), but what it means," Sullivan said. "I don't know what having a bipartisan Cabinet gets you. I don't see that it gets you anything." Yes, he said, it may mean a few Cabinet members can occasionally give a presidential policy some bipartisan cred. "I'm suggesting this is a very sophisticated political community," Sullivan said. It'd be one thing if Obama had appointed the Republican leader of the Senate to a high-level Cabinet position. That might move things toward some sort of reconciliation government, he said. "But governing is way more sophisticated than these symbolic gestures." Whatever you make of the appointments, Obama is on solid ground when he said his three Republican Cabinet appointments were unprecedented. We rate his statement True.

pomt-04577	"Fast and Furious" began under the Bush administration.	false	/florida/statements/2012/sep/24/barack-obama/barack-obama-said-fast-and-furious-began-under-bus/	President Barack Obama is far ahead with Hispanic voters, but he faced tough questions during a Univision interview at the University of Miami on Sept. 20, 2012. Interviewer Jorge Ramos asked Obama about the controversial "Fast and Furious" program, in which federal agents allowed guns to be sold and brought into Mexico so they could trace the weapons. But the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) ended up losing track of some of the guns. Two were found at the crime scene where U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry was killed on Dec. 14, 2010. "I think it’s important for us to understand that the Fast and Furious program was a field-initiated program begun under the previous administration," Obama responded. "When (Attorney General) Eric Holder found out about it, he discontinued it. We assigned an inspector general to do a thorough report that was just issued, confirming that in fact Eric Holder did not know about this, that he took prompt action and the people who did initiate this were held accountable." Several readers wrote to us that Fast and Furious did not start under President George W. Bush, so we decided to check it out. A day before Obama’s Univision interview, the U.S. Department of Justice’s Inspector General released a 512-page report about Fast and Furious. "Our review of Operation Fast and Furious and related matters revealed a series of misguided strategies, tactics, errors in judgment and management failures," the report noted. The report also clearly shows that Fast and Furious began under the Obama administration, dating its inception to October 2009. (Obama took office in January 2009.) This directly contradicts Obama’s claim. There is one mitigating factor, however: A program similar to Fast and Furious did go forward under the Bush administration in 2006 and 2007. That program, called Operation Wide Receiver, also attempted to track suspicious weapons. Allowing gun sales to go forward even when the ATF had probable cause to believe the sales were unlawful has come to be known as "gun walking." The two operations -- Fast and Furious and Wide Receiver -- had some similarities, and both were run out of the ATF’s Phoenix Field Division. The inspector general explored both programs in depth and found similar problems. "The risk to public safety was immediately evident in both investigations," the inspector general’s report states. The White House told us that Obama was referring to the general practice of gun walking, which happened in both administrations. "The President was referring to the flawed tactic of gun-walking, which despite Republicans efforts to politicize this issue, began under the previous administration and it was our attorney general who ended it," said White House spokesman Eric Schultz. U.S. Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., chairman of the House Oversight & Government Reform Committee, and Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, the senior Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, issued their own 211-page investigative report this summer. The investigations led House Republicans to hold Attorney General Holder in contempt for failing to satisfy their requests for documents. House Democrats walked out on the criminal contempt vote, which passed 255-67. Our ruling Obama said that the Fast and Furious program began "under the previous administration." That is not the case; Fast and Furious did begin during the time Obama held office. Another similar program, called Operation Wide Receiver, did happen during the Bush administration, and a recent inspector general’s report criticized both operations as ineffective and seriously flawed. But Operation Wide Receiver is not the same thing as the Fast and Furious program. We rate Obama’s statement False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-09-24T17:37:09	2012-09-20	['None']
pomt-06897	"The U.S. won't default, because default means that you don't pay your creditors. And it takes about 10 percent of the money that's coming in right now" to pay interest to bondholders.	false	/georgia/statements/2011/jul/26/tom-price/georgia-republican-tom-price-says-paying-debtholde/	While some predict dire consequences if the federal government doesn’t end its stalemate over the debt ceiling, U.S. Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., argues that the risk to the nation isn’t that great. The nation won’t default on its debts, the Roswell Republican told Candy Crowley on CNN’s State of the Union on July 24, 2011 -- not even if Capitol Hill lawmakers fail to reach a deal to raise the limit before the Aug. 2 deadline. The federal government still has plenty of money to pay bondholders, Price told Crowley. "Well, the U.S. won't default, because default means that you don't pay your creditors," Price replied. "And it takes about 10 percent of the money that's coming in right now..." If that's right, we wondered, then why all the hand-wringing? First, some background. President Barack Obama and Congress have been engaged for months in intense negotiations discussions about raising the debt ceiling, which is the legal limit on how much money the government may borrow. After hitting the debt ceiling earlier this year, the U.S. Treasury Department juggled accounts to buy time for further negotiations. Officials now expect the debt limit to be reached on Aug. 2, 2011. The negotiators have so far failed to come to agreement, with each party offering its own plan to end the crisis. If the debt ceiling isn't raised by Aug. 2, the nation won’t have the money to cover all of its debts, the Obama administration has warned. But Price argues that a failure to pay the government’s bills does not in itself mean the government is in default. What really matters, he argues, is that the U.S. pays the interest it owes on bonds. (There’s some disagreement about whether the government can prioritize its payments, but many experts think that if push came to shove, the U.S. government could choose which of its bills to pay first.) And the nation has more than enough money -- even without a debt limit increase -- to pay this portion of its debt, Price says. We’ve heard this argument before. U.S. Rep. Michelle Bachmann of Minnesota, a leading Republican presidential contender, said during a July 13, 2011 press conference that "it is simply not true" that "if Congress fails to raise the debt ceiling by $2.5 trillion, that somehow the United States will go into default, and we will lose the full faith and credit of the United States." Price appears to be correct that cash inflows could cover bondholder obligations, at least for a while. The Bipartisan Policy Center -- a Washington, D.C.-based think tank with a board that includes former politicians from both parties -- conducted an analysis of what the government's fiscal situation would be if a deal on the debt ceiling is not reached. When the center analyzed the government's inflows and outflows for the rest of August 2011, it found $172.4 billion in cash coming in, to offset required payments of $306.7 billion. That works out to a deficit of $134.3 billion. With that amount of income to work with, the government -- if it could prioritize payments -- could pay the monthly costs of Medicare and Medicaid ($50 billion), Social Security ($49.2 billion), Pentagon vendors ($31.7 billion), interest on the debt ($29 billion) and unemployment benefits ($12.8 billion). Those categories total $172.7 billion. But doing so would mean delaying other payments -- for instance, Pell grants and other educational programs ($20.2 billion), salaries and benefits for federal employees ($14.2 billion), welfare and food programs ($9.3 billion), health and human services grants ($8.1 billion), housing assistance ($6.7 billion) and many other programs, including military active duty pay ($2.9 billion), veterans affairs program ($2.9 billion), Department of Justice funding that includes the FBI and federal courts ($1.4 billion) and IRS refunds ($3.9 billion). The assumption by Price and Bachmann is that the financial markets would be satisfied as long as the interest on bonds was paid, even if doing so meant delaying payments to any number of other creditors to the federal government, from Social Security beneficiaries to federal workers to Pentagon contractors. However, as we noted in a previous article, independent experts don’t agree with his definition of "default," and they’re skeptical that investors or ratings agencies will just ignore a federal decision to pay certain creditors and not others and that U.S. creditworthiness would remain as sterling as it was before. Lawrence J. White, an economist at New York University's Stern School of Business, said that "if the federal government delays payment to anyone, then certainly in a common-sense sense, the government has defaulted on its obligations." Neil H. Buchanan, a George Washington University law professor who specializes in economics, agreed. "If the government fails to pay any obligation on schedule, that is a default in both the common-sense meaning and in the legal sense," Buchanan said. "The person to whom money is owed has not been repaid. That's a default." The same experts were also skeptical that simply paying bondholders would convince investors and ratings agencies to overlook late payments or non-payments to other federal creditors. "I believe that the financial markets would not be copacetic" if bondholders were repaid but other creditors weren’t, White said. "They would realize that the government was stiffing one set of claimants who are creditors, and the markets would worry that they might be next." Buchanan of GWU agreed with White’s point and added another. "Foreign holders of (Treasury notes) will understand that it is politically untenable to pay foreigners but not Americans," he said. "Can you imagine the firestorm if Americans were told that we cannot afford to pay Social Security recipients, because we have to pay foreign banks and governments first? The argument that we must do so to protect our credit rating will sound an awful lot like ‘too big to fail’ -- the same argument that said that banks in 2008-09 had to be bailed out, while homeowners and unemployed workers were thrown to the wolves. No matter how strong the argument that doing so is necessary to protect our credit rating, the bottom line is that the government would be favoring foreigners over Americans. Any foreign investor would know that this is not politically sustainable. They would have every reason to dump our bonds, or at least to require much higher rates of return." In a June 3, 2011, report, the Congressional Research Service -- a nonpartisan research arm of Congress -- agreed with many of these points. "The full faith and credit of the U.S. government would be threatened," the CRS wrote. "Domestic money markets, in which government securities play a major role, could be affected substantially. ... If the government fails to make timely payments to individuals, service providers, and other organizations, these persons and entities would … be affected. Even if the government continued paying interest, it is not clear whether creditors would retain or lose faith in the government’s willingness to pay its obligations. If creditors lost this confidence, the federal government’s interest costs would likely increase substantially and there would likely be broader disruptions to financial markets." And on July 13 and 14, two major ratings agencies -- Moody’s and Standard & Poors -- publicly announced that they were watching carefully. The agencies said they were reassessing whether U.S. Treasury Bonds merited the top credit rating. These ratings, issued by agencies that are independent of the government, provide guidance to investors about how secure bond investments are. "It is very difficult to make lots of individual decisions about whom to pay," said Barry Bosworth, an economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution. "I think (Price's) statement is false in the sense of implying it is not a significant problem," though he added that the Obama administration "is also creating a false sense of disaster when it implies that everything will stop on Aug 2. Financial markets are still having trouble believing that America has sunk to such a point of government dysfunction, and there is yet to be much of a reaction. Thus, the effects are likely to build more gradually." So where does this leave us? We’ll concede that we’re in relatively uncharted territory. However, independent experts suggest that simply paying debt holders while letting other federal creditors go unpaid won’t keep the U.S. from "default" -- either the technical or the common-sense variety. In addition, both academic experts and the Congressional Research Service agree that only paying debt holders won’t be enough to keep U.S. creditworthiness unblemished. Price downplays the real risks of default and creditworthiness in a prioritization strategy that pays debt holders at the expense of other federal credit holders. So we rate his statement False.

pomt-02495	Richmond is "the most vegan-friendly city."	false	/virginia/statements/2014/feb/14/dwight-jones/mayor-jones-says-richmond-rated-most-vegan-friendl/	Editor’s note: This is a rewrite of a Truth-O-Meter that was posted on Feb. 12, 2014. The new version provides greater context for Mayor Dwight Jones’ statement, but does not change our original ruling of False. Mayor Dwight Jones opened his annual State of the City Address quoting from the popular travel guide Frommer’s, which touted Richmond’s outdoor offerings and craft beer scene as reasons it recommends the capital as a top travel destination this year. "What they’re saying is something that we already know: That Richmond is a cool place to live, work and play," Jones said. Later in the speech, Jones cited additional Richmond accolades, and one particularly caught our attention. "We are the most vegan-friendly city," he said, drawing chuckles from the audience. Has the old confederate capital become become the Mecca for people who abstain from all animal products? Lettuce take a look. Tammy Hawley, the mayor’s spokeswoman, pointed us to 2013 ratings by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, a group that promotes meat-free diets and opposes animal testing. PETA ranked U.S. cities based on "availability of vegan options" as well as the "influence of vegan culture," said Lindsay Rahat, the group’s associate director of campaigns. Richmond won kudos for being "packed with meat-free restaurants" and hosting an annual vegetarian festival. But those accolades did not result in Richmond winning the vegan-friendly crown. In fact, Richmond was ranked 10th. The top spot went to Austin, Texas, in the heart of cattle country. Also ranked ahead of Richmond were Portland, Ore.; Los Angeles; New York; Chicago; Seattle; Salt Lake City, Las Vegas and Boulder, Colo. In trumpeting Richmond’s other accolades, Jones accurately noted that various groups have included Virginia’s capital in Top 10 lists of cities that are the best place to work and live, the most creative, the best place for jobs and have the best outdoors. But in addition to botching Richmond’s vegan standing, the mayor erred on two other ratings: *He touted Richmond as the "happiest city for young professionals" based on a 2011 posting by Careerbliss, an online jobs site. Richmond was 15th on the list. *He said Richmond is the "healthiest city for women," although it actually ranked 51st in a 2011 survey by Self Magazine. Our ruling Jones said Richmond is the "most vegan friendly city." The source he cited, however, rated Richmond 10th in providing animal-free food. We don’t doubt Jones’ contention that Richmond is "cool." When it comes to vegans, Richmond may be hospitable, but it has not been rated the friendliest city for them. So we rate the mayor’s claim False.	None	Dwight Jones	None	None	None	2014-02-14T18:18:05	2014-01-30	['None']
pomt-14514	Blocking a U.S. Supreme Court nomination during the remaining months of President Obama’s term "would leave the nation’s highest court with an unprecedented year-long vacancy."	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2016/feb/19/new-hampshire-democratic-party/new-hampshire-democratic-party-says-one-year-vacan/	The unexpected death of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has thrown Washington, D.C., into tumult, with Democrats and Republicans clashing loudly about the timing of a replacement. The clash is especially notable in high-profile U.S. Senate races, including the one in New Hampshire that pits Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte against her challenger, Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan. Ayotte almost immediately backed Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s pledge not to take action on a Supreme Court nominee until after the election of the next president. And the state’s Democratic Party was quick to criticize. In a Feb. 16, news release, the party put it this way: "Fearing discontent from her far-right base and pressure to appease her party bosses, Senator Kelly Ayotte has rejected her constitutional duty and decided to back Mitch McConnell’s controversial decision to block the Senate from giving fair and timely consideration to President Obama’s next Supreme Court nominee -- a move that would leave the nation’s highest court with an unprecedented year-long vacancy." While much of that statement is political boilerplate, we were interested in the last clause -- that refusing to bring up any Obama nominee would lead to an "unprecedented year-long vacancy" on the court. We decided to check it out. Asked for comment, the state Democratic Party directed us to two news stories. The first was an article from NPR that noted the longest time a Supreme Court nominee waited to receive a vote. That was in 1916, when Louis Brandeis waited 125 days. And a quick look at the calendar reminds us that Obama has more than 300 days remaining in office. Those are interesting numbers, and certainly suggest that if the Senate refuses to act on Obama’s nomination, there would be an unprecedented wait for a vote. But that’s not what the party’s press release said. It referred to a "vacancy" on the court itself, which is different. Later in the same NPR article, which cites the Congressional Research Service as a source, it’s said that: "The longest vacancy on the Supreme Court was 27 months between the Tyler and Polk administrations before the Civil War. Tyler, derided as ‘His Accidency,’ because he was the first vice president elevated to the White House, also holds the distinction of a record eight nominees rejected or withdrawn." Tyler actually had another Supreme Court seat open up, and that one took more than 400 days to fill on its own. Taking those two openings from 1843 and 1844 into account, it certainly looks like a yearlong wait for a justice to be seated has precedence. The party also pointed to an article on the Time magazine website. This article, however, says that since the Supreme Court has had nine members -- going back to 1869 -- the court went 391 days without a ninth justice in 1969 and 1970. Over that time, the Senate rejected two nominations from President Richard Nixon. So while this article indicates that a yearlong vacancy on the court would be unusual, it wouldn’t be unprecedented. Even restricting our view of the court to its existence as a nine-member panel, it has spent one lengthy span -- less than 50 years ago -- without a ninth justice. There is one way in which McConnell’s threat would be unusual. As PolitiFact noted this week, it would be unheard of for the Senate to spend more than a year without acting on a Supreme Court nomination after such an appointment is made. In the past, extended vacancies on the court resulted from nominees being rejected sequentially, rather than not acted upon at all. Our ruling The New Hampshire Democratic Party said that not confirming a Supreme Court nominee from President Obama "would leave the nation’s highest court with an unprecedented year-long vacancy." While the lack of Senate vote on an actual nominee would indeed be unprecedented, there are at least three examples of a seat in the Supreme Court going unfilled for more than a year, one of them within the last half century. The statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-01912	"Obama regime planned the influx of illegal alien children at the border."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/jun/30/rush-limbaugh/limbaugh-says-obama-administration-planned-influx-/	So far this year, over 47,000 children without their parents have shown up at the southern border and the government is scrambling to deal with them. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson published an open letter in Spanish-language newspapers earlier this week, urging parents in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras to stop sending their children north. House Speaker John Boehner formed a group of representatives to focus on the surge of children migrants. In a news conference, Boehner faulted President Barack Obama. "We’re seeing a humanitarian disaster, one of the administration’s own making," Boehner said. Some of the president’s critics go much further. In a June 24 broadcast, conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh said the administration planned the surge at the border. "You tell me this is not purposeful," Limbaugh said. "Listen. Six months ago, the regime began planning how to transport tens of thousands of undocumented children from the border." For Limbaugh, the smoking gun is a Jan. 29, 2014, posting for contract work by the Homeland Security Department. The agency said it wanted a private company to take as many as 65,000 children in the course of the year and hand them over to the department of Health and Human Services. "On Jan. 29, they knew," Limbaugh said. "Somebody had advance knowledge that these thousands of undocumented children would be flooding the border ... All these kids were planned in advance to show up." That contract work posting has generated a lot of speculation in conservative circles. It appeared a week and a half ago on the website Infowars.com with the interpretation that the government sought to escort illegal immigrants into the United States. Soon after, that allegation morphed into the suspicion that the surge reflected some hidden plan by the administration to advance a political agenda. "This advertisement raises a lot of questions," said the website Weasle Zippers on June 20. "There is a lot of specificity reflected in this document that seeks to deal with an influx that hadn’t as yet happened." In this fact-check, we examine the evidence that the Obama administration planned the influx. The story behind the estimate In November 2013, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops sent a delegation to Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras to get a better understanding of why unaccompanied children were flooding America’s southern border. Jeanne Atkinson, director of the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, went on that trip and met with two Homeland Security officials stationed in the region. The report from that trip said that in November the Homeland Security Department estimated "that more than 60,000 unaccompanied minors could enter the United States during 2014." "The numbers are not pulled out of a hat," Atkinson told PunditFact. "Based on looking at past years and the daily numbers, we knew it was an estimate but it seemed like a reasonable estimate." A rising trend line Here’s a graph of the numbers Atkinson and her team saw. The figures from the Homeland Security Department (see the raw data here) show a rapid increase in the number of children stopped as they tried to enter the country. The shift began in 2011 and it was driven by children leaving El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Between 2011 and 2012, the number of children leaving those three countries increased by 158 percent. The next year, the increase was 105 percent. We ran the numbers several different ways. Allowing for the modest increase from Mexico, by the end of fiscal year 2013, officials would have been looking at an average annual increase of 55 percent from the four countries combined. Multiply that by the total in 2013, about 38,000, and you get just under 60,000. The data in the graph are for fiscal years which end in September. The 2014 data does not include the entire year. The point is, in the fall of 2013, anyone looking at the situation would be seeing steep increases. W. Ralph Basham was commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection from 2006 to 2009. Basham told PunditFact that the government estimates in 2013 follow established practice. He said people should remember they are based on more than just the numbers. "The Border Patrol interview these people on the border," Basham said. "When they hear what's going on the ground in these countries and why these people are leaving, they start to put the numbers together. They are always looking at trends to prepare themselves to deal with these surges. Unfortunately, this time it got ahead of them." Basham said he finds it "hard to buy the notion that the administration planned this." He said the situation on the border stems from a "perfect storm" of rampant violence, sometimes by gangs, in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, limited capacity in this country to quickly send these children home and a belief in Central America that if you get over the border, you can stay in America. The Migration Policy Institute, a research group that promotes better management of immigration flows, pointed to the impact of a 2008 law, the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act. Under this legislation, signed before Obama took office, the government follows what the institute called a "more child-friendly" policy that could encourage more families to take the risk of trying to get their children into the country. Atkinson with the conference of Catholic bishops said she has heard first-hand accounts of the threats to children, including gang members seizing teenage girls from their homes. "These mothers and grandmothers told me, ‘Do you think we would send them away if we had any other option?’ " Atkinson said. Basham said the governments in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras need to contain this violence but so far, they’ve been unable to. Our ruling Limbaugh said the Obama administration planned the rapid influx of children attempting to get into the country. Not that the administration planned for the influx, but actually planned it. Limbaugh did not return our requests for comment, but his evidence was a request for contract services from early 2014 that projected that about 65,000 children would need to be moved to temporary shelters. Limbaugh viewed that estimate with suspicion. In reality, the rising number of unaccompanied children arriving at the border was well established by the end of 2013. Catholic relief workers and a past Homeland Security commissioner said all the data pointed to a continued increase into 2014. Many of the factors behind the surge of children lie outside the control of the administration. No expert we reached gave any credence to the idea that the administration planned this crisis on the border. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-00093	Says he "raised graduation rates to nearly 90 percent."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/oct/31/tony-evers/gubernatorial-candidate-tony-evers-ad-inflates-his/	Republican Gov. Scott Walker and Democratic challenger Tony Evers have sparred over a wide-range of issues in the run-up to the Nov. 6 election. Among the most notable: Education. In June 2018, Walker proclaimed himself the "education governor" -- a not-so-subtle dig at Evers, who is state schools superintendent. "We need to make sure that every student graduates here in the state of Wisconsin. That every student, no matter where they come from, what ZIP code they live in, graduates," Walker told reporters Sept. 4, 2018, at an event welcoming students back to classes at a school in Waukesha. Evers responded with a Sept. 25, 2018, TV ad that began with ominous music and the question: "Do you trust Scott Walker on education?" The ad went on to tout several claims about Evers’ achievements, including this one that we want to check: "Tony raised graduation rates to nearly 90 percent." Is he right? Digging into the numbers We started at the state Department of Public Instruction, which Evers has led since 2009, since it is the official keeper of such numbers. Department spokesman Thomas McCarthy pointed us toward WISEdash -- the Wisconsin Information System for Education Data Dashboard. There we found these graduation rates for the relevant years: 2009-’10 – 85.7 percent 2010-’11 – 87 percent 2011-’12 – 87.5 percent 2012-’13 – 88 percent 2013-’14 – 88.6 percent 2014-’15 – 88.4 percent 2015-’16 – 88.2 percent 2016-’17 – 88.6 percent So, that indicates a steady -- if slow -- increase. But what about for the real starting point -- the year before Evers took office? McCarthy said the numbers are not comparable, because with the 2009-’10 year, the state moved toward what is known as the "adjusted cohort graduation rate." It was created by the National Center for Education Statistics in an effort to address students who enter and leave a "class" before graduation. Previously, the graduation rate was calculated by using a freshman class as the baseline, compared to the number of graduates four years later. The rest of the country moved to this approach a year later than Wisconsin, in 2010-’11. Either way, the number did rise to nearly 90 percent -- but that is only part of the claim. The larger point made by Evers is that he and his policies are responsible -- even solely responsible -- for the gains. We have seen this sort of claim many times before, when politicians take credit -- or assign blame -- for things that beyond one person’s control. For instance, there was this Walker claim from earlier in the campaign: "Our bold reforms have Wisconsin’s unemployment rate down to an all-time LOW of 2.9 percent, and the number of people working at an all-time HIGH!" Walker’s numbers were largely on target, but experts said there were many other factors at work. We rated it Half True. What about the graduation rates? Alan J. Borsuk, senior fellow in law and public policy at Marquette Law School, said Evers can take some credit. "Of course, it is the product of many factors, many people, and, ultimately, many students, parents and teachers doing well in their roles," said Borsuk, a former longtime education reporter at the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. "It's something to applaud. But it's a feather in the cap of whoever is at the top of the pyramid. And if the rates had gone down, critics and opponents would blame Evers." Borsuk noted that at times Walker has taken credit for improvements in student performance, and cautioned: "In my book, both Evers and Walker are taking credit for things that have factual basis, but the role played by them individually or by actions they led is easy to overstate." Meanwhile, McCarthy -- the department spokesman -- said Evers has focused on improving graduation rates since the beginning of his tenure. McCarthy cited the convening of a "graduation summit," and Evers committing to the goal of "Every child a graduate, college and career ready." But he acknowledged that a central part of that plan, state grants for districts with the highest dropout rates, were not approved by Walker and the Republican-controlled Legislature. Thus, the example undermines Evers’ claim that his actions alone increased the graduation rates. It shows support from other parts of support from other parts of state government are needed for funding and policy changes. Other initiatives cited by McCarthy included a "continuous review" of academic standards, a modernized data system that can "help identify students likely to drop out" and "modernized assessments, including the ACT (college entrance test), that complement the data system in providing feedback to teachers and parents alike." Our rating In a recent campaign ad, Evers says he has "raised graduation rates to nearly 90 percent." Evers took office in 2009. In the 2009-’10 year, the graduation rate was 85.7 percent. In 2016-’17, the most recent year available, it was 88.6 percent. But, like other politicians before him, Evers gets off track by giving himself too much credit for changes that have many factors, including -- perhaps especially -- efforts at the local school district level. We rate the claim Half True.	None	Tony Evers	None	None	None	2018-10-31T06:00:00	2018-09-25	['None']
pomt-12378	In 2008, "candidate Obama, he's not even president-elect, sends William Miller over to Iran to establish a back channel and let the Iranians know that should he win the election, they will have friendlier terms."	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/jun/02/kimberley-strassel/did-obama-seek-back-channel-talks-iran-during-his-/	Amid media reports that President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner sought secret "back-channel" communications with Russia before Trump’s inauguration, some conservative commentators say outraged liberals have a short memory. They say Barack Obama did pretty much the same thing during the 2008 presidential campaign, secretly sending former Ambassador to Ukraine William Miller to Iran. Like Kushner, they say, Obama went around the existing administration to forge his own diplomatic path with a foreign adversary. "Let me set the scene for you. It's 2008, we are having an election, and candidate Obama, he's not even president-elect, sends William Miller over to Iran to establish a back channel and let the Iranians know that should he win the election, they will have friendlier terms," Wall Street Journal columnist Kimberley Strassel said on NBC’s Meet the Press on May 28. Candidate Obama faced criticism for saying he would talk to Iranian leaders as president. And after he took office, his administration pursued back-channel communications — meaning secret dialogue outside normal diplomatic processes — with Iran as part of achieving the nuclear deal. Journalists reported on those processes extensively. We were intrigued by the claim that Obama sought secret communication channels with Iran before he even won the 2008 election. When we started to dig into it, we were surprised to find that the evidence supporting that narrative is slim and ultimately insufficient. As far as we can tell, this allegation stems solely from the commentary of Michael Ledeen, a conservative Iran and Iraq expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and a critic of Obama’s foreign policy. Ledeen was also a national security consultant to President Ronald Reagan’s administration. He recently co-authored a book with Trump’s ousted National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, The Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and Its Allies. Strassel hasn’t replied to our requests for comment, but she defended her comment on Twitter by citing Ledeen’s work. By Ledeen’s account, Miller told him that Obama sent him to Tehran in 2008. Ledeen has made this claim a number of times since at least 2013, in blog posts, on conservative talk radio, on Twitter in prepared remarks, and in a phone interview with PolitiFact June 1. "During his first presidential campaign in 2008, Mr. Obama used a secret back channel to Tehran to assure the mullahs that he was a friend of the Islamic Republic, and that they would be very happy with his policies," Ledeen wrote in 2014 for conservative website PJ Media. "The secret channel was Ambassador William G. Miller, who served in Iran during the shah's rule, as chief of staff for the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and as ambassador to Ukraine. Ambassador Miller has confirmed to me his conversations with Iranian leaders during the 2008 campaign." We called up Miller. He said Ledeen’s claims are "totally untrue." Miller told us that he supported Obama’s 2008 candidacy and knew some of the campaign’s foreign policy staff from his decades-long public service career, but he had no role in the campaign or the subsequent administration. Miller does have extensive experience with Iran, starting out as a diplomat there in the 1950s and 1960s. President Jimmy Carter chose Miller to be a lead negotiator during the 1979 hostage crisis, while Miller was serving as staff director of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. And as a private citizen, he played a role in the release of American hikers who were imprisoned in Iran from 2009-11. But "the assertion that Obama sent me as an envoy is totally false," he said, adding that he’s met Ledeen a few times but doesn’t really know him. Miller said he travels frequently to Iran but didn’t in 2008. When we told Ledeen that Miller was telling a different story, Ledeen stood by his account. "(Miller has) changed his mind," Ledeen said. "He’s decided he didn’t go to Tehran." So either Ledeen or Miller isn’t telling the truth. We’re sensitive to the idea that someone who was involved in secret communications might not be forthcoming with us about those communications. But it’s also telling that there have been no independent news reports to corroborate Ledeen’s claims, given the extensive reporting on the Obama administration’s relations with Iran and negotiations over the nuclear deal. Marie Harf, who headed the State Department’s Iran nuclear negotiations communications strategy during Obama’s second term, said she hadn’t heard of these allegations until we called her. "Never in my time at the State Department or working on Iran negotiations did any back channel prior to when we were in office come up," she said. Wall Street Journal foreign affairs reporter Jay Solomon, author of The Iran Wars, said he "could never prove" that Obama sought a back channel to Iran as a presidential candidate, but he can’t definitively say it didn’t happen. Like Solomon, National Iranian American Council President Trita Parsi never came across any evidence for the alleged back channel while researching either of his two books about the Obama administration’s relationship with Iran, including the upcoming Losing an Enemy: Obama, Iran and the Triumph of Diplomacy. Parsi questioned Ledeen’s credibility and said, "At this point, I'm completely convinced this is all B.S." Our ruling Strassel said that in 2008, Obama’s presidential campaign secretly sent former Ambassador William Miller to Iran to talk with Iranian leaders. This is a case of he-said-she-said. A single conservative scholar says Miller told him about his secret ‘08 campaign mission to Iran. Independent journalists who have covered U.S.-Iran relations extensively haven’t been able to confirm the account. There is no corroborating evidence, and Miller says it’s not true; he says he never worked on behalf of the Obama campaign, and he didn’t travel to Iran in 2008. At PolitiFact, we believe the burden is on the speaker to back up their claim with evidence. The evidence here is insufficient, so we rate this claim False.

pomt-11452	"The Obama administration had cut $300 million from school safety."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/09/ted-cruz/did-obama-cut-300-million-school-safety-not-really/	Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, says to prevent school shootings in the future, the country should look to the past. In 2013, Cruz and Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, proposed legislation that Cruz said could have prevented the Feb. 14 Parkland, Fla., shooting. "One of the things Grassley-Cruz did was increase funding for school safety by $300 million," Cruz said on CNN March 7. "The Obama administration had cut $300 million from school safety. You know, if that had been in place, that might well have meant that another armed police officer could have been in Parkland and could have stopped that killer before he murdered those teenagers." Cruz’s comment about Obama cutting $300 million from school safety caught our attention. We wondered if Cruz was right. 2010 Obama budget proposal Cruz’s office pointed to Obama's 2010 budget. That year President Barack Obama called for the elimination of the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities State Grants program as part of his budget request. The savings by cutting the program: $294 million. "President Obama’s 2010 budget zeroed out $294 million in school safety funds," Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said. "That is a fact." Congress went along and defunded the program. So that’s about $300 million. But there’s more to this story than just the dollar figure. The particular state grant program Obama and Congress cut was formula-driven, essentially providing guaranteed money to states and school districts. However, in the same budget that eliminated the formula program, Obama requested an additional $100 million for a companion program that handed out grants on a case-by-case basis. Congress ultimately only added $51 million to that, but in any event, the cut Obama sought was closer to $200 million, not $300 million. Money spent on a variety of programs It is also important to note how that money was spent. The Safe and Drug-Free Schools program had a focus on preventing both drug use and violence. It covered "health education, early intervention, pupil services, mentoring, rehabilitation referral, and related activities." William Modzeleski, who headed the program through 2011, told us the program funded a variety of things that went far beyond armed guards or security. "We were involved in a wide range of activities, ranging from working with the Secret Service on how to identify students on the pathway to violence to one where we spent millions to ensure schools had emergency management plans," Modzeleski told us. The program also funded mental health and responses to the H1N1 flu. Obama wasn’t the first president who wanted to end the program. President George W. Bush tried the same thing in his FY 2007 budget proposal. A 2001 study by RAND had said the program’s structure was "profoundly flawed." University of New Hampshire researcher Todd DeMitchell told us that Obama’s budget reflected a different strategy. "The emphasis appears to have shifted to a broader perspective of improving the culture and climate of the school with an increased focus on bullying, health, character and possibly less emphasis on hardening the school site," DeMitchell said. Spending and the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings Cruz’s statement focuses on one budget decision by the Obama White House in 2010, but doing so ignores what happens in the years that followed. In 2013, after the killings of elementary schoolers and their teachers in Newtown, Conn., Obama rolled out a plan to prevent such slayings from happening again. The package was expansive, including an assault weapon ban and changes to the background check system. But specific to schools, it included $385 million in new spending. It offered "$150 million to school districts and law enforcement agencies to hire school resource officers, school psychologists, social workers, and counselors." There were $30 million for schools to design emergency management plans, and $40 million "to help districts work with law enforcement and other local agencies to coordinate services for students who demonstrate need." There were at least $75 million aimed at boosting mental health interventions at schools. Like the Safe and Drug-Free Schools program, the proposal covered a lot of ground, but it had more big-ticket line items aimed at violence alone. It is worth comparing Cruz’s plan to put $300 million into school safety. He sought $30 million a year for a decade to pay for more police to protect schools. Obama’s plan called for $4 billion to pay for 15,000 more police officers. Of course, neither plan -- Obama’s nor Cruz’s -- became law. Cruz and Grassley have re-introduced their bill. As a final budget note, Obama ultimately ended the Safe and Drug-Free School program entirely, and folded it into a new program called Successful, Safe, and Healthy Students. Our ruling Cruz said the Obama administration cut $300 million in school safety money. That fits with the elimination in 2010 of the formula-driven Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities State Grant program. A fuller look at Obama’s proposed 2010 budget puts the cut around $200 million. In addition, Cruz ignores that in 2013, Obama called for $385 million to respond directly to mass shootings in schools, and $4 billion to hire an additional 15,000 police officers. Cruz’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. Update: After we published, we heard from Cruz's office. The fact-check reflects their comments. The rating remained unchanged. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Ted Cruz	None	None	None	2018-03-09T11:45:35	2018-03-07	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-02645	During the lead-up to the American Revolutionary War, "some guy in Boston got his head blown off because he tried to secretly raise the tax on tea."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/jan/16/andrea-tantaros/tantaros-says-americans-dont-know-their-history-th/	Fox News co-host Andrea Tantaros scolded Americans for not knowing their history on The Five on Wednesday. She inadvertently provided proof moments later, in the form of … Andrea Tantaros. Tantaros and other The Five panelists were talking about a new report from the conservative Heritage Foundation, which ranked America only 12th in terms of economic freedom. Tantaros said countries ahead of the United States, like Estonia, are more economically free because they "actually know their history, and they study their history, and they study ours and what we’re doing here." Americans, on the other hand, have gotten lazy and complacent, she suggested. "If you ask most people, they don’t even know why we left England," she said. "They don’t even know why some guy in Boston got his head blown off because he tried to secretly raise the tax on tea. Most people don’t know that." We can’t fact-check what Americans do or do not know. But what’s clear is there appears to be no story of "some guy in Boston" getting "his head blown off because he tried to secretly raise the tax on tea." Early American history experts were generally puzzled over what Tantaros was talking about and thought she might have mashed a few Revolutionary War-era stories together. Neither Tantaros nor Fox News responded to our request for clarification. But our experts were certain on a couple of things: 1. No one secretly tried to raise the tax on tea. In 1767, The British parliament imposed a series of duties on goods being imported to the colonies -- including on tea. The laws implementing the tariffs are called the Townshend Acts, after Charles Townshend, who came up with the idea. Many prominent colonists objected, arguing that under British law colonists could not be taxed without having representation in parliament. All of the tariffs were repealed in 1770, except the tariff on tea. The 1773 Tea Act, which spawned the Boston Tea Party (and more than 200 years later was part of the inspiration for the tea party political movement), did not increase taxes on tea, said University of North Texas associate professor Guy Chet. What it did, essentially, was create a tax break for the British-held East India Company that would allow it to sell tea cheaper in America than anyone else (even cheaper than tea smuggled into the colonies). Colonists refused the ploy to prop up the East India Company and legitimize British colonial rule, and boarded the first tea ships in Boston and dumped the tea overboard. "The Tea Act is routinely and understandably (but incorrectly) lumped in with these other other laws that did raise taxes," said Chet, author of Conquering the American Wilderness: The Triumph of European Warfare in Colonial New England. Point being: No secret, and no direct effort to increase the tax. 2. The man who tried to tax tea on colonists wasn’t in Boston when he died. If you had to identify one person as the tax on tea guy, it’d be Townshend, who was chancellor of the Exchequer. But he didn’t die in the colonies and certainly didn’t have his head blown off. Townshend barely lived past the passing of the Townshend Acts. He died Sept. 4, 1767, of a "putrid fever." "I don't know what Tantaros is talking about. Sounds like bunk to me," said Benjamin L. Carp, an associate professor of early American history at Tufts University and author of Defiance of the Patriots: The Boston Tea Party and the Making of America. "No one in British North America tried secretly to raise the tax on tea, much less get his head blown off for the attempt," said Samuel A. Forman, who blogs about revolutionary history and wrote Dr. Joseph Warren: The Boston Tea Party, Bunker Hill, and the Birth of American Liberty. 3. It’s hard to say who "got his head blown off," if anyone. Forman speculated that Tantaros may have been talking about Joseph Warren, who was president of the Massachusetts Provincial Congress. Warren was killed at the early Revolutionary War battle of Bunker Hill on June 17, 1775. He was shot in the head, "dying heroically at the climax of the battle," Forman said. (History buffs can watch a video of Forman describing Warren’s injuries.) Chet said Tantaro may have been referencing violence against British customs officers attempting to enforce existing taxes on tea. "Just as a matter of ballistics, it'd be pretty difficult to blow someone's head off with 18th century weaponry unless you were using artillery," Carp said. "Although maybe you could do the trick with small arms; you'd have to ask a weapons expert." Our ruling Tantaros, in lamenting Americans’ knowledge of U.S. history, said, "Some guy in Boston got his head blown off because he tried to secretly raise the tax on tea." No one got their head blown off for that reason, and no one secretly tried to raise the tax on tea. The British government imposed duties on a number of goods in 1767, including tea. The 1773 Tea Act actually would have made tea cheaper for colonists, though it would have done so by propping up the British-held East India Company. The man responsible for the original tax died of a fever in Britain. Tantaros appeared to be trying to make the point that Americans -- who live in a country that is less economically free, according to one report -- forget what the lack of freedom feels like. That position may or may not be supported by their lack of knowledge of the lead-up to the Revolutionary War. But it’s not supported by her version of history because it did not happen.

pomt-04816	Paul Ryan would "outlaw in vitro fertilization."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/17/ultraviolet/womens-group-says-paul-ryan-would-outlaw-vitro-fer/	While Paul Ryan’s views on fiscal policy and Medicare have dominated news coverage of his being picked as Mitt Romney’s running mate, liberal critics of the GOP ticket are also trying to portray Ryan as an extreme conservative. One example is a five-point graphic released by UltraViolet, a group that seeks to "expand women's rights and combat sexism." The group was co-founded by Nita Chaudhary, the former national campaigns and organizing director at MoveOn.org Political Action, and Shaunna Thomas, the former executive director of the P Street Project, the lobbying arm of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. The graphic’s final claim is that Ryan would "outlaw in vitro fertilization -- seriously. That same bill that outlaws some forms of birth control could also make in vitro fertilization illegal. Can't have kids naturally? Too bad." We wondered whether it was accurate to say that Paul Ryan would "outlaw in vitro fertilization." The Sanctity of Human Life Act In footnotes, the group cites the Sanctity of Human Life Act, which Ryan co-sponsored but which remains stalled in the House. (UltraViolet did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) The bill, which is only three pages long, says that "the right to life guaranteed by the Constitution is vested in each human being, and is the paramount and most fundamental right of a person; and the life of each human being begins with fertilization, cloning, or its functional equivalent, irrespective of sex, health, function or disability, defect, stage of biological development, or condition of dependency, at which time every human being shall have all the legal and constitutional attributes and privileges of personhood." It goes on to say that "Congress, each State, the District of Columbia, and all United States territories have the authority to protect the lives of all human beings residing in its respective jurisdictions." And it defines "human" and ‘"human being" to include "each and every member of the species homo sapiens at all stages of life, beginning with the earliest stage of development, created by the process of fertilization, cloning, or its functional equivalent." We see two issues with the group’s claim that the bill Ryan co-sponsored would "outlaw in vitro fertilization." First, the bill doesn’t specifically outlaw vitro fertilization -- in fact, it doesn’t even mention the procedure by name. Rather, any impact the law could have would be an indirect consequence of provisions that are primarily aimed at stopping abortion. Second, the bill wouldn’t necessarily affect in vitro fertilization by itself. The bill empowers states to enact legislation that protects human life from conception, but it doesn’t appear to force them to do so. We’ll look at these two issues in order. Medical questions Even though the Sanctity of Human Life Act doesn’t specifically address in vitro fertilization, experts we interviewed said the law, if passed, could lead to severe restrictions on its practice. In vitro fertilization was pioneered in the 1970s and is commonly used by some of the estimated 10 percent to 15 percent of couples who want to have a child but are having trouble getting pregnant. Typically, a number of eggs are fertilized to increase the likelihood of pregnancy, and only some may be transferred to the woman’s uterus. If unused fertilized eggs remain after the procedure is complete, doctors usually freeze the remaining embryos. According to RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association, the law would call into question the legality of these practices: "If microscopic fertilized eggs/embryos are full humans, anything that puts an embryo at risk could be a criminal violation, even if its goal is the undeniable social good of helping someone have a baby." For instance, the group asks, if a frozen embryo in a clinic doesn’t thaw successfully, would that put the practitioner at risk of prosecution? "At a minimum, (the bill) would force changes in the practice of reproductive medicine (e.g., limitations on the number of eggs that may be fertilized) that are not in patients’ best interests and constitute inferior medical practice," RESOLVE said. That’s why such groups as the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, the American Academy of Assisted Reproductive Technology Attorneys and all oppose "personhood" measures. So does the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which says personhood laws "would have wide-reaching harmful implications for the practice of medicine and on women's access to contraception, fertility treatments, pregnancy termination, and other essential medical procedures." Even if the bill doesn’t outlaw in vitro fertilization procedures directly, opponents say it could have a chilling effect on the profession. The mere introduction of criminal penalties into common and, according to the industry, essential practices could be enough to push some practitioners to quit rather than risk prosecution. Bioethicists agreed that the bill, if it became law, would pose serious challenges for the procedure. "If this law passed, it would not outlaw IVF, but it would make it next to impossible to do," said Arthur Caplan, who heads the division of medical ethics in the department of population health at New York University’s Langone Medical Center. "It would not allow any destruction of embryos, and since nearly all IVF depends on the overproduction of embryos the law would drastically alter how IVF is done, raising the cost of doing it and hugely decreasing the success rate." I. Glenn Cohen, co-director of the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics at Harvard Law School, agreed. By his reading, a reproductive technology process that involved "the destruction of a human species member after fertilization can be criminalized and treated equivalent to killing an already-born human being," Cohen said. Legal questions But while it’s clear that the traditional practice of in vitro fertilization could be severely affected if the bill became law, it’s too strong to say, as UltraViolet did, that the bill would "outlaw in vitro fertilization." Outlawing the creation of embryos, the necessary first step, "isn’t part of the bill," said Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. Kermit Roosevelt, a constitutional law specialist at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, agreed. "I could see this leading to prohibitions on destroying unwanted embryos created for the purpose of IVF, but I’m not sure why that would ban the practice entirely," Roosevelt said. Another crucial point that UltraViolet’s graphic glosses over is that the bill would allow states to criminalize certain practices used with embryos, but it doesn’t appear to force them to do so. Gualberto Garcia Jones, a lawyer and director of Personhood USA, which promotes "personhood" legislation, said that "as a proponent of zero tolerance of abortion, I know that if this bill passed, we would have our work cut out in state legislatures to pass implementing legislation to deal with cases such as the destruction of embryonic human beings etc. Personhood USA fully supports reforming and regulating the in vitro industry. Unfortunately this bill doesn’t do that -- it’s a declaration, not a regulation." The most far-reaching possibility suggested by any of our legal experts was that the federal law might tie the hands of states in passing laws on embryo destruction, or put existing laws at risk. "This looks to me as though Congress is defining personhood to begin at conception, regardless of what the states want to say, so it's forcing that characterization on them, and then their laws will have to be consistent with that definition," Roosevelt said. Still, that interpretation is speculative and would probably have to be litigated in the courts. Meanwhile, it’s not even clear that the bill would pass judicial muster if it can be passed -- something it hasn’t come close to doing so far. Roosevelt said he thinks the law is "probably not" constitutional. Our ruling UltraViolet has a point that the bill Ryan backed could significantly alter the way in vitro fertilization is practiced. However, the group exaggerates when it says the bill in question would "outlaw in vitro fertilization." The bill doesn’t outlaw the procedure directly -- whatever impact it has would likely require action by states, which many states may be unwilling to undertake. And while the bill likely outlaws specific practices that have historically been considered important for practicing in vitro fertilization, it would not ban the procedure itself. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.	None	Ultraviolet	None	None	None	2012-08-17T17:54:07	2012-08-16	['None']
pomt-13358	"No fracking waste is being dumped in New York State"	false	/new-york/statements/2016/sep/30/basil-seggos/fracking-waste-being-dumped-new-york/	When New York State officials banned fracking in late 2014, environmentalists celebrated a victory against the controversial natural gas extraction method. Then last year, a report said waste from the process was still coming into the state. Lawmakers grilled Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Basil Seggos at a water quality hearing in Albany. He contradicted the report. "No fracking waste is being dumped in New York State, and those who perpetrated that are wrong," Seggos said at the hearing. "There's no high volume hydraulic fracturing going on in New York. It's going on in other states. No waste from those other states is coming into New York." Environmental advocates, however, point to information from Pennsylvania’s Department of Environmental Protection that indicates trucks carry fracking waste from the Keystone State to landfills in upstate New York. So do upstate landfills accept fracking waste? The Department of Environmental Protection in Pennsylvania confirmed that landfills in New York State took in fracking waste. We looked into what kinds of waste comes into the state, and which ones do not. Waste brought into New York Fracking is different from traditional gas drilling. Instead of drilling a well straight into the ground, a company first drills vertically, then directs the well horizontally. The drillers then blast porous rock with fluid to extract natural gas. Regulations by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation block any waste more than 80 percent liquid from being dumped into landfills. That prevents liquid fracking waste, like flowback water, from being brought into the state for disposal. But any solid waste that may have come in contact with fracking liquids is permitted under current regulations. Data from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection shows three New York State landfills this year accepted waste from high volume hydraulic-fractured drilling. According to a database from the Pennsylvania agency, the Chemung County Landfill took more than 15,000 tons of waste, including what’s listed as drill cuttings, synthetic liner materials, servicing fluid, soil contaminated by oil- and gas-related spills, and "other oil and gas wastes." Hakes C&D Landfill in Steuben County took in about 1,900 tons of drill cuttings. Hyland Facility Association in Allegany County took 550 tons of soil contaminated by oil- and gas- related spills. The definitions of this waste from the state of Pennsylvania are vague. We spoke with Scott Perry from the Pennsylvania environmental agency for a better understanding. Perry said any soil contaminated by an oil- or gas-related spill more often than not comes in contact with flowback water - a mixture of fluids and chemicals used during the fracking process. "The most commonly spilled material is flowback water," Perry said. "Drilling fluids and diesel are probably the next most common." Companies are not required to detail what they include in the "other oil and gas wastes" category. Perry said it’s considered a catch-all for waste that does not fit any other description. He said it could mean anything from the packaging used to store chemicals before they are used for fracking to broken equipment. Synthetic liner materials are thick mats or liners used to prevent chemicals and other waste from leaking into the ground. Perry said any residue is washed from the liners before they’re transported for disposal. Servicing fluid is used to maintain the wells and can include a water/oil-based mud and foam. All three New York State facilities that received waste this year are owned by Casella, a landfill operator. When we contacted one of the landfills, they said they do perform analytics on the waste as it’s brought to the facility, but a message to Casella for details was not returned. We also reached out to both companies that operate the wells where the waste came from, but neither responded to our request for more information. As recently as last year, one facility in Syracuse was still accepting fluid that the Pennsylvania agency says includes brine from fracking. But no records indicate any New York State facility has accepted the fluids this year. Landfills accepted flowback waste from fracking as recently as 2013. The state's response We contacted the Department of Environmental Conservation about the contradiction between Seggos's statement and the Pennsylvania database. In a statement, the department said any drilling waste brought into the state was strictly regulated. In the same statement, the department said waste from fracking was not allowed in the state. "Given recent public statements from advocates, it is important to set the record straight regarding the disposal and use of high volume hydraulic fracturing waste," said Kevin Frazier from the Department of Environmental Conservation. "Under Gov. Cuomo’s leadership, New York State banned high volume hydraulic fracturing and prohibits the use and disposal of any high volume hydraulic fracturing waste or fluids, including brines, anywhere in the state." "DEC also strictly regulates the State’s four landfills that currently accept drill cuttings from drilling operations. These landfills employ radiation detectors to ensure that no regulated radioactive materials are received by the facility. In addition, DEC staff provide on-site oversight and inspection to ensure operations are in compliance with state regulations." The DEC said it is "in the process of strengthening these already robust regulations." A public review and comment period about the proposed revisions ended Sept. 13, Frazier said. When asked to clarify the confusion over banning some waste while accepting others, the DEC did not offer a clear response. Our ruling During a hearing on water quality, Basil Seggos, the New York State commissioner for environmental conservation, said "no fracking waste is being dumped in New York State." Data from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection indicates waste from fracking is transported from Pennsylvania’s wells to three landfills in New York. The waste was transported as recently as earlier this year. Well operators did not report sending any flowback or fluid waste from fracking to New York State this year, but they have in years past. We rate this claim as False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2570100e-68fb-4c7a-91ea-4f6cb7426032	None	Basil Seggos	None	None	None	2016-09-30T21:13:45	2016-09-07	['None']
pomt-01192	"Too many" tattoos "on visible body parts" keep some applicants out of the military.	true	/florida/statements/2014/dec/03/jeb-bush/too-many-visible-tattoos-keep-out-military-jeb-bus/	Failing test scores aren't the only problem that has caused the military to reject applicants, says former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Another problem is, well, more colorful: tattoos. While talking about his push to improve public education at the Wall Street Journal CEO Council event Dec. 1, Bush pointed to problems the military has finding qualified applicants. Bush mentioned a video in which a military official talked about the challenge: "In the video beforehand, Gen. Dempsey talked about a 25 percent pass rate. Now that’s not just because of the test, that’s also because of obesity, and too many tattoos, to be honest with you, on visible body parts for people that are trying to get into the military. But the pass rate for a high-school-level test to join the military is about 35 percent, I think, or 40 percent at best. These are abysmal numbers." PolitiFact has previously fact-checked claims about whether obesity and physical fitness have kept applicants out of the military (both true). But we hadn’t explored the role of tattoos in filling the military ranks. We couldn’t resist taking a look. Tattoo policies Each branch of the service sets their own rules about tattoos, but it was the Army’s policy that has drawn the most ink recently from the media. In March 2014, the Army overhauled its appearance policy, which includes more than two pages of detailed rules about "tattoo, branding and body mutilation." This led to a rush to get tatted so soldiers could be grandfathered in under the new rules. The Army has a detailed procedure for grandfathering that directs unit commanders to document each tattoo in an official memorandum. The Army’s policy states that tattoos, regardless of subject matter, are prohibited on certain areas of the body, including the wrists, hands and fingers, as well as the head, face, and neck, defined as "anything above the t-shirt neck line to include on/inside the eyelids, mouth, and ears." "Soldiers may have no more than four visible tattoos below the elbow (to the wrist bone) or below the knee," the policy says. So far under the new policy, 2,919 applicants could not process due to tattoos, said Brian Lepley, an Army recruiting spokesman. "Those 2,919 are the ones whose tattoos were so egregious it was highly unlikely a waiver could get through, or the applicant chose not to try a waiver," he said. In the Army, 193 tattoo waivers for applicants have been granted, while one was rejected and four are pending. Lepley told us that tattoos are not the No. 1 disqualifier. Medical conditions, drug use, misconduct or some combination of those issues disqualify more applicants. News reports around the country indicate the tattoo policy is limiting applicants, though. "Right now, with the new tattoo policy in effect, we currently turn away one in every five applicants that come through our door," U.S. Army Captain Joshua Jacquez told CNN in a report from El Paso. Maj. Gen. Allen W. Batschelet, head of Army recruiting at Fort Knox, told the Kansas City Star in August that the policy is, "rather arbitrary, in some sense." However he said that "you have to draw the line somewhere" for the Army to present a professional image. As for waivers, Batschelet said, "To be blunt, the higher quality of applicant you are, the more tolerance we'd probably have for seeking a waiver. If you came in to sign up today and were a neurosurgeon, I got to tell you I'd go a long way toward trying to get an exception if all you had was a disqualifying tattoo." The Air Force, Marines and Navy also have their own tattoo policies. All of them generally ban tattoos that are obscene, advocate discrimination or express offensive views. The Air Force policy has a seven-step measurement guide that contains math formulas in an attempt to prevent tattoos from covering more than 25 percent of an exposed body part. (Partial inches should be rounded up to the nearest inch, it says.) The Marines policy states that applicants with more than four tattoos must be administratively reviewed. The Navy’s policy is the least detailed -- only 277 words -- though like the other services, it bans head tattoos. Our ruling Bush said that among the reasons applicants are rejected by the military -- in addition to being obese or not passing the test -- is that some have "too many tattoos" on visible body parts. Since the Army updated its tattoo policy earlier this year, 2,919 applicants could not proceed due to tattoos. Other branches of the service also have restrictions on types and locations of tattoos that keep some applicants out of the military. We rate this claim True.

pomt-14360	Ted Cruz is in negotiations to be Donald Trump’s running mate.	false	/texas/statements/2016/mar/22/facebook-posts/false-donald-trump-ted-cruz-negotiating-joint-repu/	We spotted this headline below a post on the Dallas Morning News’ Trailblazers political news blog: "Breaking: Cruz Negotiating With Trump for VP Spot." Of course, that would be Texas Sen. Ted Cruz negotiating with Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump to serve as Trump’s November 2016 running mate. Huge! But wait--where’s the breathless CNN report, the insiders analysis on Fox News or even the basic newspaper scoop? We found nothing of the sort in online searches or in the Nexis news database and when we asked Cruz’s campaign about the Feb. 25, 2016, Elect Leaders post, spokesman Brian Phillips replied by email: "Is this a serious request?" Well, the Cruz-negotiating-with-Trump item, also posted on ElectLeaders.com, which describes itself as keeping "watch on our leaders and wannabe leaders," has a little traction. When we saw the headline March 21, 2016, the post had been shared on Facebook more than 34,000 times. Historical precedent And history shows a joint ticket could play out. In 2008, Barack Obama chose to run with a failed presidential hopeful, Joe Biden. In 1980, Ronald Reagan reached out to the defeated George H.W. Bush. Twenty years before, Democrat John F. Kennedy picked Texan Lyndon B. Johnson. So Trump-Cruz, pairing the frontrunner with the fellow running second, is possible. On the other hand, Phillips followed up with an email calling the post "categorically false." Anonymous sourcing For our part, we noticed a red flag in that the Elect Leaders item doesn’t quote named sources, not even a campaign spokeswoman offering a "no comment." Here’s what the post says: "A high ranking Cruz campaign official has told Elect Leaders that Sen. Cruz is in negotiations with Mr. Trump to become his Vice Presidential Nominee after Rubio dropped out Tuesday." That’s confusing timewise in that Sen. Marco Rubio dropped his presidential bid Tuesday March 15, 2016, after falling short of victory in his home state of Florida. The item goes on to say Cruz "has been the most consistent performer in primaries behind Trump. They are seeing the writing on the wall and want to negotiate from a point of strength which will evaporate over time." "The official," again unnamed, "stated Mr. Trump is interested in using Sen. Cruz’s ground game in the general election, likes his appeal to the conservative base and his stance on immigration. Of the other options for VP none hold as strong of an opinion on immigration outside of Gov. Jan Brewer from Arizona who is also being considered." Brewer, by the way, is no longer governor. Finally, the post says, Cruz, the former solicitor general of Texas, has an eye on shifting from vice president to the Supreme Court. Cruz, the item says, "in exchange for his support is wanting to be named to the Supreme Court if an opening occurs while Mr. Trump is president. Mr. Trump does not see this as an issue and a small price to pay to bring Sen. Cruz his fundraisers, donors and staff on board," the post says. We tried to reach out to Elect Leaders about the post and didn’t hear back. Otherwise, we found no indication Trump-Cruz negotiations were (or are) afoot. A Trump maybe, Cruz's ‘zero interest’ In November 2015 -- eons ago in politicking time maybe especially given Trump’s references to Cruz as "Lyin’ Ted"-- Trump told conservative talk-show host Laura Ingraham that Cruz might be his choice for the No. 2 slot. To be fair, Trump declined to name a potential running mate from among his GOP opponents before noting his affection for Cruz. "Well, I like like him," Trump said at the time. "He’s backed everything I’ve said … Ted Cruz is now agreeing with me 100 percent." But Trump also didn’t go further down the veep path, saying: "I like to think of victory, I’ve had a lot of victories, and I like to do victories first, then start thinking about other things." Cruz, meantime, said March 15, 2016 that he wasn’t inclined to join Trump on a single ticket, if offered the vice presidency. Conservative talk-show host Hugh Hewitt asked if Cruz "would ever agree to serve as" Trump’s "vice president?" "I have absolutely zero interest in doing that," Cruz replied, going on to say he expected to overtake Trump and win the delegates needed to secure the presidential nomination.

pomt-07958	"We’ve saved over $100 million of (health care) costs" in Milwaukee County. "I did that."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jan/24/lee-holloway/acting-milwaukee-co-executive-lee-holloway-say/	A special election for Milwaukee County executive will be held in April 2011, which means that before long, boasts from politicians will be as common as tattoos on basketball players. The five candidates include Lee Holloway, the County Board chairman who became acting county executive in December after Scott Walker resigned to become governor. Holloway, in a Jan. 12, 2011 meeting with Journal Sentinel editors and reporters, tried for a three-point basket with a boast about the county’s health care expenditures. "We’ve saved over $100 million of costs," he declared, then added for emphasis: "I did that." Has the county really saved more than $100 million on its health care bills? And does Holloway deserve all the credit? In making his claim, Holloway traced the health care savings to 2006, when the County Board moved to undo changes made by the Walker administration. Let’s take a look at the sequence of events. January 2006: Contract implemented. A four-year contract negotiated by the Walker administration with Madison-based WPS Health Insurance, the county’s third-party administrator for health care, takes effect. It moved the county from being self-insured to fully insured. Early 2006: Problems surface. County staff inform the County Board’s Finance and Audit Committee, which requested monthly reports on health care costs, that the county’s 2006 health care costs were projected to exceed the budget by $7.3 million. Based on a recommendation by the committee, a work group of county employees is formed. Its job is to reduce health care expenses by pursuing changes in, or even termination of, the 4-month-old WPS contract. October 2006: Staff, contract changes. The County Board approves a Holloway proposal to create a Division of Employee Benefits to manage health care and pension benefits. The aim is to build expertise in those areas in order to lower costs. The county also reverts back to the self-insured model for health care through negotiations with WPS. The change is retroactive to January 2006. November-December 2006: More changes. The County Board approves a resolution by Holloway and other supervisors to create an advisory committee to help find health care cost savings. Stuart Piltch -- a consultant hired by the county to help with a pension lawsuit -- is enlisted to help find savings. That recommendation came from county staff attorneys. Beginning in 2006, the County Board led labor negotiations that resulted in increased co-pays, deductibles and co-insurance for employees. January 2009: Contract canceled. The county persuades WPS to release it from the four-year contract one year early. The county then signs a new agreement with UnitedHealthcare, which saved $30 million in one year alone, according to Dave Arena, the first director of the new county employee benefits unit. (Holloway credited Arena with helping achieve health care cost savings, but fired him without explanation in January 2011 after becoming acting county executive.) Those were the major health care changes. So, how much money did the county save? From 2006 through 2010, an estimated $130 million, according to calculations by the county auditor’s office and the employee benefits division. That doesn’t mean the county health care bill is dropping. The $123.7 million the county spent in 2006 dropped by 1 percent in 2007, county figures show. But since then it has risen each year to the $139.6 million that was budgeted for 2010. What Holloway meant is that the county spent an estimated $130 million less on health care than it would have if the county remained in the fully insured plan that was put in place by Walker. Now, how much credit for the savings does Holloway deserve? The consensus among seven key figures we interviewed was that many people were involved in achieving the savings. But the view also was that Holloway took most of the leadership role, while the Walker administration played more of a supportive role. A spokesman for Walker declined comment. Holloway’s major public initiative was the new employee benefits division. That gave the county expertise to negotiate the early release from the WPS contract and to bargain a less expensive deal with UnitedHealthcare. The county estimates the change saved nearly $49 million. Holloway’s other contributions were behind the scenes. According to county auditor Jerome Heer, Holloway’s leadership was crucial in boosting employee contributions for health benefits, which saved an estimated $44 million. Heer also said that if Holloway had not made reducing health care expenses a priority, the county would have stayed with the costlier fully insured plan put in place by Walker. Changing from fully insured to self insured saved an estimated $37 million. Offering a different view were County Supervisor Paul Cesarz and former supervisor Richard Nyklewicz. They said the savings were achieved through collaborative efforts of Holloway, the County Board, county staff and others. So, how do we size all of this up? County figures support Holloway’s claim that the county saved more than $100 million on health care bills -- in terms of what it would have spent had changes not been made. As for credit, no one argues that Holloway dug into the nuts and bolts of the changes the county made. As the County Board chairman, Holloway’s role was leadership, and he played a key -- though far from solo -- role. To put it another way: Holloway didn’t dribble the basketball the full length of the court before taking his shot -- he got an assist from his teammates. But his shot did go in. We rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Lee Holloway	None	None	None	2011-01-24T09:00:00	2011-01-12	['None']
pomt-01567	"There were fewer civilian casualties in Cambodia than there have been from American drone attacks."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/11/henry-kissinger/kissinger-drones-have-killed-more-civilians-bombin/	Henry Kissinger, secretary of state under President Richard Nixon and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, has been making the media rounds to talk about his latest book. He’s mainly been asked for his take on the present: the war zones of Iraq and eastern Ukraine. But on NPR, the past came up. Kissinger was asked to defend his support for the U.S. bombing campaign in Cambodia between 1969 and 1973. For those who might not remember, while most of the fighting took place in Vietnam, as the tide shifted against the South Vietnamese and American forces, Nixon unleashed massive airstrikes in neighboring Cambodia to hit North Vietnamese soldiers and supply lines in that country. It was kept secret from the American public, and when news leaked out, Congress ultimately moved to shut it down. Kissinger deflected criticism of the campaign, saying President Barack Obama has "hit more targets on a broader scale than the Nixon administration ever did." "I think the principle is essentially the same," Kissinger said. "You attack locations where you believe people operate who are killing you. You do it in the most limited way possible. And I bet if one did an honest account, there were fewer civilian casualties in Cambodia than there have been from American drone attacks." A reader suggested we run Kissinger’s comparative death tally through the Truth-o-Meter. We examined whether the Cambodian bombings killed fewer civilians than drones. The civilian death toll from both lacks precision, but by any estimates we could find, Kissinger is wrong. The only question is, by how much. Drone deaths Since 2004, it is tacitly accepted if not always officially acknowledged that missiles from American drones have targeted Taliban and al-Qaida forces in Pakistan and Yemen. The Defense Department does not report civilian casualties and so most of what we know comes through eyewitness and press reports. A handful of projects pull together the data to keep a running record, but we focused on the only two that cover every year since drones were deployed in 2004, and count civilian deaths in every country where America has used drones to lethal effect. The New America Foundation, a group backed by a wide range of supporters, from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to Netflix, keeps tallies on Pakistan and Yemen. It reports a maximum total number of civilian deaths of 394. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a private effort based in London, has Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia in its database. Its maximum estimate is 1,089. This includes civilian deaths in which researchers were unsure that drones were responsible. Most organizations report a range of casualties. For the purposes of this fact-check, we used only the largest estimates, so the highest number we could find was 1,089. Cambodian bombing deaths A single B-52 bomber could carry up to 108 bombs, each with 500 pounds of explosives. Hundreds of bombers flew thousands of missions over Cambodia. Based on data from the U.S. Air Force, history professor Ben Kiernan at Yale University reported that from 1969 to 1973, the United States dropped more than 470,000 tons of explosives on Cambodia. Other official estimates put the figure at over 500,000 tons. There is no firm accounting of the civilian deaths that brought. Kiernan told PunditFact, based on where the bombs fell, the tonnage, and anecdotal reports, he thinks the truth lies somewhere between 50,000 and 150,000. "I believe the actual toll is closer to the upper limit of that range," Kiernan said. Getting an accurate count is difficult for reasons that go beyond the lack of any records. During the American bombing, a civil war raged in the country. Many people died in that fighting, quite apart from the American attacks. Worse, the deprivation and slaughter that followed under the Pol Pot regime killed in the neighborhood of a million people or more. Their deaths buried any hope of any census in the wake of the American air campaign. A 1980 CIA report calculated that 600,000 to 700,000 Cambodians lost their lives between 1970 and 1975. But that would include the deaths of soldiers as well as civilians, from all causes, and the time period extended beyond the American bombing. Bruce Sharp, an independent researcher in Chicago, runs Mekong.net, a website focused on Cambodia before and after the war. Sharp said he thinks 50,000 is a safe minimum estimate. A University of Hawaii political scientist compiled a number of demographic studies and arrived at a minimum estimate of 30,000. Craig Etcheson has spent 35 years studying Cambodia. From 2006 to 2012, he served as the chief of investigations building charges of war crimes against former leaders in the Pol Pot regime. Etcheson is reluctant to quantify the civilian casualties but he thinks it is much less than many believe. "I have conducted thousands of interviews with Cambodians who lived through that period of Cambodian history," Etcheson said. "I can count on one hand the number of people who described first-hand knowledge of civilian deaths from U.S. bombing. This result does not seem consistent with estimates that hundreds of thousands of people were killed." On the other hand, Etcheson said he was not specifically seeking an answer to the question of how many people died from American bombs. "We know of two incidents in 1973 that were widely reported at the time, because they occurred in or near Republican territory, and not far from Phnom Penh – one at Neak Luong and one at Sa’ang – in which 300 to 400 civilians were killed in each of two unfortunate B-52 strikes," Etcheson said. Saying it was "highly probable" that this happened again in areas that westerners could not reach, Etcheson said his hunch is that "it was probably more than 5,000 civilians killed by U.S. bombing." The lowest figure we found came from retired Air Force intelligence officer Earl Tilford. Tilford served in the Strategic Air Command from 1971 to 1975 and had first-hand knowledge of the bombing campaigns. His latest book, Crosswinds, argues that much of the bombing during the Vietnam War was ineffective, and in the case of Cambodia, the military goal was distorted by bureaucratic in-fighting between the Air Force and the Navy. Tilford told PunditFact that the Air Force ran many missions simply to keep a higher profile in the military budgeting process. More sorties were taken as proof of military importance. Tilford recalled repeated bombing runs of a lake in central Cambodia. The B-52s literally dropped their payloads in the lake. The sole purpose was to keep the mission count high. The upshot? The total tonnage might have little relation to the damage inflicted. In addition, Tilford said most bombs were dropped in remote, thinly populated regions. "I would say 4,000 to 5,000 civilians at most might have died," Tilford said. "That’s a guess based on a knowledge of targets, of the topography and that there were just not that many civilians in those areas." We should note that at the end of the bombing campaign in 1973, U.S. forces targeted more heavily populated centers and the sortie rate rose to 240 per day. Intelligence and press reports at the time told of entire villages being leveled. An April dispatch from United Press International quoted international relief workers who estimated that bombing raids had killed no fewer than 3,000 civilians in a few weeks. Cambodian government officials said tens of thousands had died. But reporters in Cambodia at the time bemoaned their inability to independently verify the impact of the American bombing. Still, in comparing the bombing deaths in Cambodia to the drone deaths today, Etcheson said his gut feeling is that "Kissinger is, at best, engaging in wishful thinking on this." Our ruling Kissinger said that he thought that an honest accounting would show that there were fewer civilian casualties from America’s bombing campaign in Cambodia than from drone attacks today. While the data lack precision in both cases, we see barely over 1,000 civilian deaths due to drones, and at least 4,000 civilian deaths due to American bombs in Cambodia (and the potential for many, many more). These figures represent a high estimate for drone deaths and the lowest guess for the Cambodian bombing in which half a million tons of bombs fell on the country over a span of four years. Kissinger couched his claim with a bit of a caveat, but a man of his experience and knowledge could reasonably be expected to understand the difference between the impact of highly targeted drone strikes and the blunt instrument of bombs dropped by B-52s. His statement departs from the most generous and common sense reading of the estimates. We rate his claim False.

pomt-05567	Says Ronald Reagan "understood repeatedly that when the deficit started to get out of control, that for him to make a deal he would have to propose both spending cuts and tax increases."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/apr/04/barack-obama/ronald-reagan-understood-make-deal-he-would-have-p/	It used to be only Republicans who enjoyed repeating over and over again, "Ronald Reagan! Ronald Reagan! Ronald Reagan!" Now Democrats are getting in on the Reagan name game, too. In answering questions before a meeting of the Newspaper Association of America, President Barack Obama invoked Reagan’s name as a model of fiscal prudence. He started off bashing Republicans, both those in Congress and those running for president, for refusing to consider increased tax revenues as a way to reduce debt and deficits. "The challenge we have right now is that we have on one side, a party that will brook no compromise. And this is not just my assertion," Obama said. Specifically, he noted a moment during the Republican presidential debates when every candidate raised a hand to indicate an unwillingness to accept budget deals with tax increases. Then Obama invoked the Gipper. "Ronald Reagan, who, as I recall, is not accused of being a tax-and-spend socialist, understood repeatedly that when the deficit started to get out of control, that for him to make a deal, he would have to propose both spending cuts and tax increases. Did it multiple times. He could not get through a Republican primary today," Obama said. So did Reagan propose tax increases as part of his budget deals? We decided to dive into history to fact-check the statement. (We asked the White House for evidence, but we didn’t hear back.) We should start by noting that if you remember Reagan as a tax cutter, your memory is good. Reagan supported cutting taxes and talked about it frequently. Under his watch, marginal tax rates decreased from top rates of 70 percent in 1981 to 28 percent in 1988. But Reagan also signed off on numerous tax increases, especially when it looked as if the previous tax cuts were driving overall tax revenues below expectations. The largest increase was the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, or TEFRA. It didn’t increase the top income tax rate, but it did increase tax revenues by tightening various rules. In 1983, he signed off on legislation to keep the Social Security program funded by raising payroll taxes and taxing Social Security benefits for some higher earners. Reagan also signed laws that modestly increased taxes or tax revenues in 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987. To measure the overall impact of tax changes, economists prefer to look at tax revenues as a percentage of the overall economy, which is Gross Domestic Product, or GDP. Under Reagan, overall tax revenues were 19.6 percent of GDP in 1981. That number dropped during Reagan’s first term but increased slightly during his second. In 1988, his last year in office, tax revenues were 18.2 percent of GDP, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Economist Bruce Bartlett reviewed Reagan’s tax record, both as president and as governor of California, for a 2011 article in Tax Notes, a respected tax publication. Bartlett noted that Reagan wasn’t exactly enthusiastic about tax increases. "As with his California tax increases, Reagan had little to say about them afterwards. In his diary, he wrote only that the TEFRA bill was ‘the price we ha(d) to pay to get the budget cuts.’ He later tried to repudiate his consistent support for tax increases after 1981. But it’s clear that getting control of the deficit in the 1980s required both spending cuts and higher revenues." Bartlett concluded, "Although he cut taxes when he could, he raised them when he had to. That’s something today’s self-styled Reaganites should remember." One thing troubled us about the wording of Obama’s statement. He said Reagan "repeatedly" would "propose both spending cuts and tax increases." Most of the analysis we reviewed indicated that while Reagan signed off on tax increases proposed by Congress, he did not often propose those tax increases himself. Still, Reagan definitely advocated in public for closing tax "loopholes" as part of pending deals, and he could wax eloquent on tax fairness. One example: Back in 1985, Reagan delivered extended remarks on tax policy to an audience of high school students in Atlanta. "Now, someone might say it's odd to talk about tax policy with young people in their teens. But I don't think so," Reagan said. "You not only understand what taxes are, what effect they have in the average person's life, but if you don't understand, you will pretty soon, when you get your first job." Reagan then described the tax breaks he was proposing for families before moving on to tax "loopholes." "We're going to close the unproductive tax loopholes that have allowed some of the truly wealthy to avoid paying their fair share," he said. "In theory, some of those loopholes were understandable, but in practice they sometimes made it possible for millionaires to pay nothing, while a bus driver was paying 10 percent of his salary, and that's crazy. It's time we stopped it. "And the way I see it, if our current tax structure were a TV show, it would either be Foul-ups, Bleeps and Blunders, or Gimme a Break. If it were a record album, it would be Gimme Shelter. If it were a movie, it would be Revenge of the Nerds or maybe Take the Money and Run. And if the IRS, Internal Revenue Service, ever wants a theme song, maybe they'll get Sting to do, ‘Every breath you take, every move you make, I'll be watching you.’" And with that 1980s pop culture flashback over, we’ll now move on to our ruling. Our ruling Obama said Reagan "understood repeatedly that when the deficit started to get out of control, that for him to make a deal he would have to propose both spending cuts and tax increases." Reagan typically did not make tax increases part of his own proposals. But he did approve and even advocate for budget deals that included increases to tax revenues, and he spoke of tax fairness in ways that contrast sharply with today’s Republicans in Congress. We rate Obama’s statement Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-04-04T18:04:27	2012-04-03	['None']
pomt-08711	Jennifer Carroll's an "outsider."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/sep/03/rick-scott/meet-outsiders-rick-scott-and-jennifer-carroll/	Trying to keep the outsider label that propelled him to victory in the Republican primary for governor, millionaire businessman Rick Scott said on Sept. 2, 2010, that he's picked a fellow outsider for lieutenant governor in Jennifer Carroll. "We have similar backgrounds," Scott said in a press conference in Brandon to announce Carroll's selection. "She's smart, she wants to work hard. She's got experience in the Legislature. She's an outsider like I am." Carroll, who was considered as a potential running mate for Charlie Crist in 2006, has an interesting story. Let's see if it adds up to being an outsider. Carroll, 51, was born in Port of Spain, in Trinidad, but was brought to the United States by her family at a young age. She joined the U.S. Navy and rose from jet mechanic to become the top aide to an admiral. In 1999, she retired from the Navy as a lieutenant commander and started a public relations firm, 3N. & J.C. Corp. She moved to northeast Florida in 1986. We've already ruled that Carroll would be the second woman and first African-American woman elected lieutenant governor. That certainly puts her outside the norms of politics, as does her being born in Trinidad. But Carroll's life after the Navy seems pretty political insider to us. Consider: Carroll ran for Congress in 2000 as a political newcomer. She lost to Democratic Rep. Corrine Brown despite outspending Brown 2-to-1. In 2001, Carroll said she talked with Vice President Dick Cheney about a job on his staff as a "domestic policy adviser." That job never materialized. Later that year, Carroll was nominated by Gov. Jeb Bush to run Florida's Department of Veterans Affairs. Her nomination was confirmed by the Florida Senate. She resigned about a year later to run again for Congress. She lost a second time to Brown. In 2003, she was elected to the state House in Florida District 13, where she has served ever since. She was appointed deputy majority leader by Speaker Johnnie Byrd in 2003 and served as a majority whip from 2004-2006. Carroll's official state House biography also includes the following highlights -- Republican Club of Clay County, "Top 10" Republican Award 1999, 2002; appointed by President George W. Bush to the White House Presidential Scholars Commission, 2001-2004; appointed by President George W. Bush to the Veterans' Disability Benefits Commission, 2004-2007; Black Political Action Committee's 2005 Vikki Buckley Political Leadership Award. Carroll's life story certainly has some of the hallmarks of being a political outsider. She was born outside the United States and spent 20 years working in the Navy. But after retiring from the Navy in 1999, Carroll has very much made politics a key part of her life. She twice ran for Congress, said she was in talks for a job with Vice President Cheney, ran the state's Department of Veterans Affairs, was elected to the Florida House and was considered for Crist's lieutenant governor choice in 2006. So Carroll has some outsider, and some insider. We rate Scott's statement Half True.

pomt-12773	John Hagee calls for "prosecuting women who say God’s name during intercourse."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/feb/22/blog-posting/mega-pastor-john-hagee-wants-jail-women-who-use-go/	A fake story about a televangelist who wants to criminalize enthusiastic pillow talk shows that sometimes humor and the news can make strange bedfellows. A story posted around Feb. 10, 2017, on USPOLN.com (short for U.S. Political News) cites a supposed screed by John Hagee, senior pastor of Cornerstone Church in San Antonio, Texas. He also is CEO of Global Evangelical Television. "John Hagee calls for ‘prosecuting women who say God’s name during intercourse’," reads the headline on the story, in which Hagee denounces blasphemy. The text quotes Hagee as saying that "there is no greater sin in terms of wrongly using God’s name than women who use it during sex." Women who do so should be jailed, the story quotes Hagee. As part of its efforts to fight fake news, Facebook flagged the story as potentially being false. And the story is very false, even though it’s not immediately apparent on many the websites that have shared it. Hagee is a controversial figure for his past remarks, which include criticizing the U.S. Supreme Court striking down same-sex marriage bans as "judicial tyranny" and saying the Holocaust was part of God’s plan to drive Jews from Europe. But he never said women should be jailed for invoking the almighty while having sex. Not that we can prove, anyway. This particular fake news story dates back to June 15, 2015, on Newslo.com, a site that identifies itself in a disclaimer as "the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web."

At the end of the most recent iteration, USPOLN.com briefly cites a Newslo.com-related site called Religionlo.com, although it doesn’t strictly say that was the source of the story.

pomt-06335	Under President Barack Obama, "more Americans are in poverty ... than at any time since the Census Bureau began keeping records on it over 50 years ago."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/09/newt-gingrich/gingrich-says-more-americans-are-poverty-today-any/	In a statement submitted in advance of the Nov. 9, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Michigan, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., decried the reach of poverty today. "More Americans are in poverty today than at any time since the Census Bureau began keeping records on it over 50 years ago," he said. Although CNBC asked candidates to submit opening statements and posted them on its website, when the debate opened they ditched them. But we thought Gingrich's statement was worth checking. Gingrich has focused on poverty before, accusing President Barack Obama of being "the most successful food stamp president in American history" because "47 million Americans are on food stamps." (We rated this statement Half True.) We decided to check whether Gingrich is right in this new statement, so we turned to the U.S. Census Bureau, which is the official federal source of poverty statistics. Gingrich is right that the numbers go back more than half a century, to 1959, and that the absolute numbers of people in poverty in 2010 -- 46.1 million -- is at its highest since the statistic has been recorded. However, Gingrich ignores population growth since 1959. Over that period, the U.S. population has increased by 73 percent. So today’s poverty rate -- that is, the percentage of people in poverty -- is 15.1 percent, compared to a high of 22.4 percent in 1959. Between 1959 and 1965, the poverty rate was higher every year than it is today. That paints a somewhat different picture than what Gingrich suggested. Still, the poverty rate in 2010 was higher than it’s been in every year for more than four decades save one -- 1983, when the rate was 15.2 percent -- and that’s largely in tune with Gingrich’s larger point. A final note: Unlike his claim about food stamps, Gingrich was more oblique about the blame Obama bears for this statistic. But he does seem to blame the president. After saying that "more Americans are in poverty today than at any time since the Census Bureau began keeping records on it over 50 years ago," Gingrich added, "President Obama and his administration have tried to blame the persistent unemployment and economic stagnation on the severity of the recession they inherited. However, the historical record shows us that the deeper the recession the stronger the recovery. America should at worst be finishing the second year of a booming recovery by now." It’s impossible to parcel out blame for the nation’s economic troubles in a scientific fashion, but we think that it’s unfair to place that much of the blame for high poverty on Obama. Our ruling Gingrich is right about the absolute number of Americans in poverty. A better understanding of the extent of poverty in the United States requires looking at the number of people in poverty as a percentage of the population. Measuring it that way, the current poverty rate is not the highest ever. Still, this rate is the second highest in more than four decades, which fits with Gingrich’s general point. However, we think Gingrich overstates the amount of blame Obama personally deserves for this statistic. On balance, we rate his statement Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/435851f0-ed97-4aab-bb33-a751e6f8c8b4	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2011-11-09T22:22:22	2011-11-09	['United_States', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-08799	Bill McCollum "backed Jim Greer's effort to hide financial irregularities."	false	/florida/statements/2010/aug/18/rick-scott/rick-scott-tries-tie-bill-mccollum-arrested-former/	The Rick Scott TV ads just keep coming. Scott, who has poured $38 million into the Republican primary for governor, began airing a controversial new ad on Aug. 17, 2010, that links primary opponent Bill McCollum to ousted and arrested former Republican Party of Florida chairman Jim Greer. The ad is called "Secrecy." Within 24 hours, two prominent Republicans asked that it be removed from the airwaves. It opens with a jail mugshot of Greer, and says (correctly) that Greer has been arrested on charges of fraud and money laundering in connection with his time as state GOP chairman. "And who backed Jim Greer's effort to hide financial irregularities?" a narrator asks. "Bill McCollum." "As investigators closed in, McCollum said Greer's financial records should be kept secret, not open to the public." The narrator's statement comes with a typed-out McCollum quote from the Associated Press on Feb. 9, 2010. "I don't think it's good for any party to have everything that's done inside the party open to the public and the press," the ad quotes McCollum as saying. The ad then continues with Greer introducing McCollum on the day McCollum announced he was running for governor, and references a statement McCollum made in June 2010 that he didn't think the state should amend its public records laws so that all communications between state legislators would be public. The ad concludes with Greer's mugshot next to a picture of McCollum framed to look like a jail mugshot. "Bill McCollum: He wants to keep it all a secret." The 30-second spot, which is part of Scott's closing argument in a tight primary for governor, was quickly excoriated by current RPOF chairman John Thrasher and Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, who serves as chairman of the Republican Governors Association. Both called the ad misleading and false, and asked that it be removed. "The truth is that Bill McCollum's leadership is part of what led to the removal of Jim Greer," Barbour said in a statement. "This ad distorts the facts and was clearly created without any knowledge of what actually took place. It has no place in this primary. We ask Mr. Scott to pull this ad and move forward in the primary in a constructive manner." More specifically, Barbour and Thrasher say that the Scott ad wrongly suggests McCollum was complicit in a cover-up when in fact he helped lead the charge to have Greer removed and investigated. The Scott campaign defends the ad as true, and says it won't be pulled. PolitiFact Florida decided to sort out the difference of opinion by focusing on a pivotal line in the ad, that Bill McCollum "backed Jim Greer's effort to hide financial irregularities." Sorting through the RPOF finances A little background is in order. The first allegations about improper spending at the state GOP came in late 2008, when newspapers reported that Greer charged personal expenses to the state party during a fundraiser. The $5,100 bill from the Breakers Hotel included using party money on spa treatments, seafood dinners and limousines. Greer said he would repay any personal expenses. Questions escalated in August 2009, after court records were released showing that indicted former House Speaker Ray Sansom charged $173,000 on his Republican Party-issued credit card. Charged expenses included taking his family on a trip to Europe, making visits to Best Buy and spending thousands on flowers, clothing, meals and hotels. The release of the records prompted some Republicans to criticize Greer, who as party chairman was responsible for party finances. Greer famously cut up a party American Express to help mollify critics. But soon thereafter, more party credit card statements were leaked to the press -- statements from Greer, former House Speaker and U.S. Senate candidate Marco Rubio and RPOF executive director Delmar Johnson. The new statements led to even more questions about how the state GOP was spending its money and led some party leaders to call for Greer's ouster. In January 2010, Greer succumbed to the pressure and resigned. When Thrasher took over as party chairman in February, he ordered an audit of RPOF finances to identify any potential wrongdoing. The audit didn't focus on credit card spending as much as a contract with a consulting company, formed by Greer and Johnson, to do work for the RPOF. The company, Victory Strategies, was paid a 10 percent commission on money raised for the party. The audit revealed that the company received $133,005 in fundraising commissions and another $66,250 for consulting services in 2009. On March 15, Thrasher forwarded results of the audit to McCollum, who asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate. On June 2, the FDLE announced Greer's arrest on one count of organized fraud, one count of money laundering and four counts of grand theft. According to the FDLE, Greer directed Johnson to open a bank account for Victory Strategies with Johnson as the only signatory on the account. This was done to conceal the flow of money to Greer. Between February and October 2009, the RPOF paid Victory Strategies a total of $199,254. Of that, Greer was paid $125,161 while keeping his ownership interest hidden. The FDLE said the payments were for many services that were never performed. PolitiFact Florida previously has ruled on claims related to the scandal. On May 3, we decided that McCollum had committed a Full-Flop on saying he supported transparency in dealing with the RPOF financial scandal. Then on July 13, we rated a claim by Thrasher that McCollum helped to work remove Greer as the head of the state party as True. McCollum's statements In this case, the Scott claim is that McCollum backed Greer's effort to hide financial irregularities. To us, that suggests McCollum was somehow complicit in Greer's scheme. There is no evidence of that, however. Rather, the Scott campaign says it's alleging that McCollum attempted to keep the scheme quiet. According to party leaders and McCollum, the attorney general first learned about the Victory Strategies contract in January, weeks before it was revealed in the media. McCollum said that when he learned about the contract, he asked another party activist attorney if it was legal. He was told yes. (McCollum said he didn't initially know Greer was a beneficiary of the contract). "It was on the face of it a perfectly legitimate contract," McCollum said in a interview on Feb. 9. "Was it outrageous? Absolutely. Was it something that should have never been entered into? Yes." That same day, Feb. 9, reporters paraphrased McCollum as saying that internal party business didn't need to be made public and that releasing credit card statements for past card holders was a decision that should be left to the next chairman. McCollum then provided the quote captured in Scott's ad. "Right now the party matters are totally internal … I don't think it's good for any political party to be having everything that's done inside the party open to the public and the press. On the other hand I think it's very important for the party regulars … (to) all have a clear and confident understanding of what's been going on in terms of everything, credit cards and bank accounts, everything else. I think that's what's been missing, and I think that's what the next chairman will correct." Unfortunately, it's difficult to tell from the quote if McCollum was talking specifically about credit card statements, or about the Victory Strategies contract, or both. Two days later in a campaign statement McCollum clarified his position. He said the Republican Party should conduct a private audit of its finances before he would ask for a public state investigation. "I share the outrage over recent revelations of extravagant contracts and lavish spending," McCollum said. "If audit findings suggest potential criminal activity, I will assist the State Executive Committee in directing these findings to the appropriate law enforcement investigatory agency. The old way of doing business at the Republican Party of Florida enabled an egregious and unforgivable violation of trust between Party leadership and our membership. Now it is time to clean up the mess. I support taking every measure possible to ensure we never again face the challenges before us today." And on Feb. 20, after Thrasher was elected chairman, McCollum called for a full internal forensic audit (as he said he would on Feb. 11), and urged that the results be released publicly (which he didn't say in the statement on the 11th). If any potential illegal activity surfaced during the audit, he said, it should be turned over to law enforcement. "Credit cards should be a part of that. Everything should be," McCollum said. McCollum's statements strike us as a man attempting to shield the Republican Party from bad PR, not someone attempting cover-up potential fraud. In the end, it appears he got bad legal advice from a former party lawyer. Yet, his comments starting on Feb. 11 were clear -- if wrongdoing is found by the party, it will be turned over to the authorities. A month later, McCollum did just that when he presented the RPOF audit findings to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. That also counters Scott's suggestion that McCollum and Greer were somehow holed up at their Tallahassee version of the Alamo surrounded by state investigators. It was McCollum who referred the matter to investigators. And as we've previously ruled, McCollum helped pressure Greer to resign. Our ruling You can argue that McCollum should have pressed for more transparency in handling the matter, and some have. And you can argue that McCollum was too slow to react to concerns over party spending, and some have. You can also argue that McCollum was too easily satisfied by the legal opinion of one person. But that is not what is being alleged in the Scott ad. It says that McCollum "backed Jim Greer's effort to hide financial irregularities." There's no evidence that we find or that the Scott campaign provided that McCollum had any knowledge of Greer's Victory Strategies contract, or any evidence that McCollum attempted to stop a criminal investigation once an RPOF audit revealed potential fraud. We rate Scott's claim False.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2010-08-18T19:35:35	2010-08-17	['Jim_Greer', 'Bill_McCollum']
pomt-05098	"Oregon schools receive millions of dollars per year in federal school lunch assistance and yet they are required to spend that money almost anywhere but Oregon."	true	/oregon/statements/2012/jun/29/ron-wyden/ron-wyden-says-food-served-oregon-schools-comes-al/	When the Senate was debating the farm bill recently, Sen. Ron Wyden highlighted the haphazard nature of the way food is purchased and provided to the school lunch program under a program known as USDA Foods. His point was simple: A lot of the food from one program in particular that ends up in school kitchens comes from points far away from the schools serving it. Using local sources of food might be cheaper, he argued, and it certainly would be more nutritious. Wyden offered an amendment that would establish pilot programs at five locations nationwide to see if using local food could be both cheaper and better. Wyden’s amendment, which passed the Senate, would give school officials in five "pilot" areas far more flexibility in deciding where they purchase food. Right now, schools that agree to take part in the program, USDA Foods, are locked into a system that almost always forces them to purchase food from outside Oregon. That program is small, supplying only 20 percent of the food used in school nutrition programs but Wyden said the $11 million a year spent on it for Oregon schools should be used for food produced in Oregon. So he offered an amendment for give states and local districts more flexibility in navigating the USDA Foods system. The program offers a list of mostly bulk items that states purchase and then supply to local districts. According to a USDA description, "Schools are ordering more bulk products that can be processed into kid-friendly items. … Decisions about what products schools order are not based just on the item’s popularity but on its overall usefulness in meeting nutritional standards." Wyden’s amendment would allow local officials, working in collaboration with state purchasing agents, more flexibility in where they can buy the food to overcome a system that brings most of the food to Oregon from other states. While small and limited, Wyden said it’s important nonetheless and changing the program would bring extra dollars to the local economy while also providing more nutritious food. After it passed, the Oregon Democrat drove home the point in a news release: "Oregon schools receive millions of dollars per year in federal school lunch assistance and yet they are required to spend that money almost anywhere but Oregon." That is the kind of statement PolitiFact Oregon can really chew on. There’s no doubt that the federal government spends "millions of dollars" to pay for school meals in Oregon. That part of Wyden’s statement isn’t in doubt. But the second part made us wonder. Is it really true that most of the food purchased for Oregon schools under USDA Foods ended up with food from "almost anywhere but Oregon?" To answer, you have to dive into federal rules governing USDA Foods and some of the department’s school food programs. It is a dense and complicated business that is as close as government gets to an extreme sport. Even the experts admit they don’t always understand all the rules and requirements. Here's just one section: "At the beginning of each school year, State agencies shall establish the per meal rates of reimbursement for school food authorities participating in the Program. These rates of reimbursement may be assigned at levels based on financial need; except that, the rates are not to exceed the maximum rates of reimbursement established by the Secretary under §210.4(b) and are to permit reimbursement for the total number of lunches in the State from funds available under §210.4. Within each school food authority, the State agency shall assign the same rate of reimbursement from general cash assistance funds for all lunches served to children under the Program." Had enough? There’s plenty more, but we’ll spare you. The regulations run 65 pages. Wyden’s spokeswoman Jennifer Hoelzer admitted her boss’s statement was based on piles of "anecdotal evidence" derived from talks with school officials as well as those at the Agriculture Department because detailed records are hard to find. But we found some. The best is a spreadsheet compiled by David Jones at the Oregon Department of Education that was also shared with Wyden. It reveals that only seven food purchases out of 166 during the 2011-12 school year came from Oregon from the USDA Foods program. That’s 4 percent for those of you who need help with the math. Cheese came from Missouri and Minnesota as well as other states. Oregon schools used meatless spaghetti sauce bought in Indiana, applesauce from Michigan and peanut butter from New Mexico. And then there was California, a true category killer that supplied Oregon schools with everything from peaches to salsa to something called "Burrito, Beef & Bean Bulk" and frozen strawberries. Forget Oregon cheese and strawberries, foodies. The only products bought from Oregon vendors were green beans, chicken fajita strips and frozen potato rounds. Are the schools "required" to buy out-of-state food if they choose to take part in USDA Foods? No. USDA Foods is voluntary. But most schools take part which means, as a practical matter, the answer is yes. Schools that take federal money for the nutrition must purchase their food through the USDA’s program. And the rules governing the program almost guarantee the sale will be made out of state. So we conclude with records that all point in the same direction. Following federal procurement rules, which schools have to do to get federal money, leaves them little choice about what to buy and where to buy it, at least for USDA Foods. It’s unknown whether the portion of out-of-state food is similarly lopsided for the entire school nutrition effort in Oregon. But for USDA Foods, the one definitive document we found shows unambiguous results -- 96 percent of food served in Oregon schools and purchased with federal dollars came from another state. That fits within any definition of "almost anywhere but Oregon," which is why we rate this claim: True.	None	Ron Wyden	None	None	None	2012-06-29T17:50:39	2012-06-20	['Oregon']
pomt-05790	Without U.S. Senate action, Texas will have more federal judicial vacancies this year than any other state.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2012/feb/24/progress-texas/progress-texas-says-texas-will-have-most-federal-j/	Texas will be No. 1 this year -- in federal judicial vacancies, an Austin-based group recently warned. Progress Texas, which describes itself as a "progressive multi-issue organization," said in an online post we spotted Feb. 8, 2012: "Texas has 5 (federal) judicial vacancies today and two more opening this year – more than any other state in the union." The post urged supporters to contact the state’s U.S. senators and urge them to ask Senate leaders to allow confirmation votes by the body on two "consensus nominees," David Campos Guaderrama and Gregg Jeffrey Costa, both nominated by President Barack Obama to fill Texas federal district judgeships. Is Texas truly poised to lead the nation in federal judicial vacancies? According to a Feb. 10, 2012, San Antonio Express-News news article mentioning Progress Texas, the group’s cited nominees have the backing of Texas Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison and John Cornyn, both Republicans. And another 16 Obama judicial nominations await Senate approval, the story says, but floor votes have not been scheduled. The article quotes Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond School of Law professor, saying the confirmation votes have not been set because Senate Republicans object to Obama’s January 2012 recess appointment of nominees to the National Labor Relations Board and Richard Cordray to head the Consumer National Protection Bureau. Tobias, who has urged the Senate to act quickly on consensus choices for judgeships, told us in a telephone interview that before Obama’s presidency, the Senate routinely confirmed such nominees in batches. But Republican Senate leaders slowed confirmations of Obama consensus choices to one or two appointees every couple weeks. "It’s just foot dragging," Tobias said. We came across other takes on the Senate's confirmation pace. In a Feb. 14, 2012, statement, U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the Senate was then running 45 judicial nominees behind the body’s pace for confirming judicial nominees when George W. Bush was president. To our inquiry, Beth Levine, a spokeswoman for Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, told us by email that the Senate confirmed 124 of Obama’s 174 judicial nominees, or 71 percent, in his first three years as president. In the comparable part of Bush’s term, she said, the Senate confirmed 169 of 215 nominees, or 79 percent. For the like period of President Bill Clinton’s tenure, the Senate signed off on 183 of 219 nominees, 84 percent, Levine said. Levine added that both Obama and Clinton saw two Supreme Court nominees confirmed in the first three years of their presidencies -- a process that has become "more involved and contentious," Levine said, since Democratic filibuster attempts during Bush’s presidency. We asked Progress Texas to elaborate on Texas’ incipient No. 1 ranking. Phillip Martin, the group’s research & policy director, said by email the group’s Feb. 8, 2012, press release making the vacancy claim should have said Texas stands to have the most "emergency" vacancies of any state. The "accidental oversight" on that release, he said, was not repeated in a subsequent release or on other Progress Texas web pages and communications. Not quite: The Progress Texas web page where we'd spotted the claim -- headlined: "CALL NOW: Make a Vote Possible" -- still had the claim posted as of Feb. 20, 2012. After we shared that link with Martin, the language there was amended to refer to emergency vacancies. Separately, Levine told us that Obama has not nominated anyone to fill nearly half of the nation's so-called emergency judicial vacancies. And why are some vacancies labeled emergencies? We learned that the administrative office of the federal court system designates vacated district judgeships as emergencies if the associated district court has a hefty workload and/or if the vacancy has lasted a while. Each district’s "weighted caseload" is devised by statisticians who assign values to different types of cases. A July 1999 footnote posted on the federal courts’ website says the weights account for differences in the time required for judges to resolve various types of civil and criminal actions. "Rather than counting each case as a single case, weights are applied based on the nature of cases. For example, cases involving a defaulted student loan are counted as 0.031 for each case and patent cases are counted as 1.9 cases. The criminal weights are applied on a per-defendant basis." According to the "Judicial Emergencies" web page, a vacant district judgeship is an emergency if that district’s weighted caseload exceeds 600 per judgeship or if the post has been open more than 18 months and the district’s weighted caseload is between 430 to 600 per judgeship. Alternatively, a vacancy is an emergency in a court with more than one authorized judgeship and only one active judge. Nationally in the year that ended Sept. 30, 2011, 509 was the average weighted caseload per federal district judgeship, up from 490 in 2010, 480 in 2008 and 472 in 2007. The federal courts’ website showed that the five emergency Texas vacancies had weighted caseloads ranging from 725 to 806. Those vacancies were created by one judge retiring and four judges shifting to "senior status," a type of semi-retirement where judges usually assume a reduced caseload. The court system’s web pages confirmed that as of mid-February 2012, Texas had more "emergency" federal judicial district court vacancies than any other state. Illinois was next with three emergency vacancies. Yet New York, which had one emergency vacancy, had the most judicial vacancies overall, eight, according to the court system’s breakdown of current openings. Pennsylvania ranked second, with six, followed by Texas and California, at five each. The administrative office maintains another web page titled "Future Judicial Vacancies," which showed 18 expected vacancies in 2012 including two in Texas. U.S. District Judge David Folsom of Texarkana is shown as retiring as of March 17, 2012, and District Judge Hilda G. Tagle of Brownsville is set to reach senior status at the end of 2012. According to the information, New York stands to land two more vacancies this year and California is expected to end up with four additional vacancies. So, New York could have 10 vacant federal judgeships by the end of the year, California could have nine and Texas is shaping up to have seven, leaving it third among states with current or expected vacancies. All these forecasts presume the Senate does not confirm any nominees from those states and that fresh vacancies do not change the states’ vacancy standings. Our ruling Progress Texas said Texas would be No. 1 in federal judicial vacancies this year. That’s not correct. Texas is now tied for third and could rank third by the end of the year, behind New York and California. Still, Texas is and stands to continue to be No. 1 in emergency vacancies. That’s what Progress Texas says it intended to say; unfortunately, it didn’t. We rate the actual claim Mostly False.

pomt-12938	Says Donald Trump warned outgoing Ghana President against last-minute job appointments.	pants on fire!	/global-news/statements/2017/jan/10/blog-posting/no-trump-never-called-departing-ghanaian-president/	Globetrotting fake news aimed to parlay Donald Trump’s name into advertising clicks recently. A website called USA Radio crafted some imaginary thoughts from the incoming American president about the departing president of Ghana. Under the headline "Donald Trump warns outgoing Ghana President," the faux article said, "Talking to the New York Times, Trump acknowledged the efforts of John Mahama in defending Africa’s democracy by peacefully conceding defeat in the country’s elections." It then continued with this purported quote: "As an outgoing president, you don’t have to implement last-minute policies that will make governance tough for the incoming president. You just have to spend the rest of the days on packing. Reverse those appointments and salary increments immediately." Facebook users flagged this for vetting as part of the social media platform’s efforts to stymie fake news. Needless to say, there is no New York Times article quoting Trump as saying this, nor did a search of the Nexis news database uncover any time when Trump spoke about Ghana. A search of the ICANN Whois registry failed to identify the website's operator. Since the December elections in Ghana drew modest press coverage in the United States, a bit of background is in order. Ghana emerged from a military-controlled government in 1992 and since that time has established itself as a stable democracy. Residents of the West African nation went to the polls in early December 2016. Challenger Nana Akufo-Addo defeated the incumbent President Mahama by a million votes. Akufo-Addo took office Jan. 7, 2017, making this the third peaceful handoff from one ruling party to another. Mahama’s administration was marred by charges of corruption, and frequent breakdowns of the electric grid that left homes and businesses in darkness. On top of that, Afrobarometer, an internationally backed public opinion project, found that more Ghanaians trusted Akufo-Addo's party to control inflation and boost jobs. The invented quote from Trump referred to Mahama’s post-election appointments for several key anti-corruption jobs in the government. The slots had been vacant for over a year and the move sparked pushback from some newly elected lawmakers. We reached out to the Trump transition team and did not hear back.

pomt-00440	Says Beto O’Rourke "has a criminal record that includes DWI and burglary arrests."	true	/texas/statements/2018/aug/22/silvestre-reyes/beto-orourke-arrested-1990s-burglary-and-dwi/	Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Beto O’Rourke of Texas has said that in younger days he was twice arrested in his hometown of El Paso--once, he says, for leaping a campus fence and the other time for driving while intoxicated. Readers have asked us whether the third-term congressman challenging Republican Sen. Ted Cruz has a criminal history. We decided to fact-check mention of the arrests in a 2012 TV ad that also was screenshot for an April 2017 Texas Tribune news story. In the ad, sponsored by then-U.S. Rep. Silvestre Reyes, D-El Paso, text next to what looks like O’Rourke’s mugshot states that the "facts" are that O’Rourke has a "criminal record" including burglary and DWI. The ad’s narrator says O’Rourke "has a criminal record that includes DWI and burglary arrests." That he does, we confirmed, which he’s acknowledged since his first run for office. We tried to phone and email Reyes about his claim and failed to connect. Next, we attempted to get our own fix on the facts by seeking documentation of the DWI arrest through a public information request to the El Paso Police Department. Martin Rodriguez, a department records specialist, said by email the agency had no responsive records. We similarly queried the University of Texas at El Paso about the earlier arrest and didn’t immediately hear back. A background check Separately, we ran a background check of O’Rourke using the LexisNexis service. According to the results, O’Rourke’s May 1995 misdemeanor arrest on the UTEP campus was later declined and his September 1998 misdemeanor DWI arrest in El Paso was dismissed. The check gave us case numbers for the arrests enabling us to fetch an El Paso County record stating that O’Rourke was initially arrested in May 1995 and that case was disposed of in February 1996. We saw too that after the DWI arrest, according to another county record, O’Rourke was referred to a misdemeanor diversion program in March 1999 and completed "DWI school" in May 1999. That document’s last entry, dated Oct. 20, 1999, says: "Misdemeanor diversion completed successfully." Campaign: O’Rourke often confirms arrests When we sought detail from O’Rourke’s spokesman, Chris Evans, he said by email that O’Rourke had consistently addressed his arrests, notably during campaign stops in Paris, Sunnyside, San Antonio and Houston, where O’Rourke told a group in August 2018 that he spent a night in the El Paso County jail after what he referred to as his 1995 arrest for criminal trespass. In San Antonio, a resident told O’Rourke she’d seen what someone described as his mugshot. O’Rourke replied: "More than 20 years ago, I was arrested--not once, but twice. So you should know that and we should all own that, if asked." O’Rourke specified that he’d been arrested for attempting to hop a fence at the University of Texas at El Paso and later, he said, for a "far more serious mistake: I drove under the influence of alcohol. There’s no justifying that." April 2005 news story The oldest published account of the arrests appears to be an April 2005 El Paso Times news story about O’Rourke’s successful run for a seat on the El Paso City Council. The story, which we found by searching the Nexis news database, quoted the incumbent, Anthony Cobos, stressing O’Rourke’s DWI arrest. Cobos, who later served as county judge before being convicted on embezzlement charges, said at the time: "I think you lead by example and his example speaks for itself." According to the story, O'Rourke was arrested on a DWI charge in September 1998 that was dismissed in 1999 after he completed a court-recommended DWI program. "I've been open about that since the very beginning. I have owned up to it and I have taken responsibility for it," O’Rourke told the paper. The Times further reported that court records showed that O’Rourke earlier was arrested in 1995 at UTEP on a burglary of building charge, which was later dropped. O’Rourke told the paper: "That happened while I was in college. I along with some friends were horsing around, and we snuck under the fence at the UTEP physical plant and set off an alarm. We were arrested by UTEP police. ... UTEP decided not to press charges. We weren't intending to do any harm," he was quoted saying. O’Rourke’s campaign later provided a photo of a document Evans described by email as the original UTEP police report on O’Rourke’s arrest there. It says O’Rourke and two other students were arrested at the university’s Physical Plant under the "burglary" portion of the state penal code, section 30.02, for "attempted forcible entry." Congressman Reyes’ TV ad Seven years later, then-Rep. Reyes unveiled his ad, which was still viewable online as of Aug. 22, 2018. A May 2012 Times news story on the ad quoted O’Rourke saying that he was driving an intoxicated friend home when he was arrested for DWI. The story said that according to police records, O’Rourke completed a diversion program and the charge was dismissed. In August 2017, more recently, O’Rourke described the arrests to an East Texas newspaper. The Palestine Herald-Press quoted him saying: "Some 20 years ago, I was charged with driving under the influence and, during my college years, I jumped a fence at the University of Texas at El Paso which resulted in a burglary charge," O'Rourke said. "I was not convicted of either. "Both incidents were due to poor judgement and I have no excuse for my behavior then. However, since then, I have used my opportunities to serve my community and my state. I'm grateful for the second chance and believe that we all deserve second chances." Our ruling A 2012 Reyes TV ad still viewable online six years later said O’Rourke "has a criminal record that includes DWI and burglary arrests." O'Rourke's comments and records indicate that UTEP police arrested O'Rourke in 1995 for burglary, a misdemeanor charge disposed of the next year. In 1998, El Paso police arrested O'Rourke for DWI, a misdemeanor charge that was dismissed after he completed "DWI school" the next year. We rate the claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com UPDATE, 6:40 p.m., Aug. 22, 2018: After this fact-check initially posted, O'Rourke's campaign provided a photo of a document described as the UTEP police report on the 1995 arrest. We've added that information, also noting that O'Rourke and fellow students were arrested for "attempted forcible entry" under the section of the Texas penal code titled "Burglary." We also added O'Rourke's reference, in Palestine, to the burglary arrest. These additions didn't affect our rating of Reyes' claim.

pomt-08858	"Obama admits he is not a citizen."	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2010/aug/05/chain-email/e-mail-sends-readers-youtube-video-where-obama-adm/	Forget a birth certificate from Hawaii. Forget the fact that two Hawaiian newspapers published notices of his birth from 1961. A CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll released Aug. 4, on Obama's 49th birthday, found that 27 percent of Americans still think Barack Obama was probably or definitely not born in the United States. So what should we make of an e-mail that sends readers to a YouTube video in which Obama blandly states that he was born in Kenya? "Obama admits he is not a citizen -- read before this is pulled," the e-mail says. "Unbelievable!!!!!" "Why has he not been impeached?" "The amazing part of this travesty is Americans continue allowing themselves to be ruled by an illegal alien." The 11-minute video, which has been online since May 2, is titled "Not Natural Born -- TRUTH MATTERS." It starts with a 30-second clip of Obama speaking before a group of adults. It begins in mid-sentence: " . . . that maybe I'm not an American citizen. Some people said he has a forged birth certificate. Well, first of all, it's true I'm not an American. I was not born in Hawaii. I wasn't born in the United States of America. I come from Kenya." If you listen closely, you can hear bad editing. The volume and sound quality of his voice change at key points, such as between "it's true I'm not" and "an American." The video never shows his lips where he makes his key admissions, so you can't see if his lips are in sync with what he's saying. And his audience offers no reaction to what should be a stunning admission. So where did that portion of the video come from? The logo at the bottom of the video reads obamasnippets.com, which takes you to a YouTube humor channel that features seven videos in which Obama's words have been edited for laughs. One example is the "Obama DRUNK!" video, where his comments have been slowed to make it sound as if he's intoxicated and hitting on an audience member. The YouTube channel makes the intent clear: "This is not 'political.' This is just for fun. This is not an 'Anti-Obama' site. This is not a 'Pro-Obama' site. This is an 'Obama Humor' site. . . . All Snippets made with 100% Obama's voice. No imitations! (That would be too easy.)" The video in which Obama is heard saying "I'm not an American," called "Birthers' Delight - Part 1," includes a disclaimer indicating that it's a spoof. The "Truth Matters" video has stripped away the disclaimer and added background music, perhaps in an attempt to disguise the telltale signs of editing. There's one other indication that the Obama "confession" is a hoax. Some anti-Obama sites that have posted the video have included a description beginning, "This video starts out with some content from obamasnippets.com, which, of course is contrived." But on the YouTube page, the word "contrived" is not visible, unless a viewer opens the full description box. However, nothing in the video itself warns viewers that the Obama clip is fabricated and the video includes a photo -- proven fake more than a year ago by our friends at Snopes.com -- of Obama holding a landline telephone receiver upside down. By Aug. 4, 2010, the Truth Matters video had been viewed over a million times on YouTube, 176 times more often than the original ObamaSnippets.com video, where its humorous nature is clear. Truth does matter, but not to the makers of the Truth Matters video or to the creators of the "Obama admits" e-mail. We rate them both as Pants on Fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/27b5599a-0629-4b38-a5e5-67d74dc36f83	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2010-08-05T18:19:37	2010-08-03	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-02671	"The Obama administration has used the Espionage Act to go after whistleblowers who leaked to journalists ... more than all previous administrations combined."	true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jan/10/jake-tapper/cnns-tapper-obama-has-used-espionage-act-more-all-/	The federal criminal charges filed against National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden make it seven times that the Obama administration has used the Espionage Act against government workers who shared information with the press. In at least two instances, the government’s investigations have delved into the practices of reporters and news organizations and put reporters in legal jeopardy. This has raised red flags among defenders of the media. In a vigorous exchange on CNN’s The Lead, host Jake Tapper asserted to Ruth Marcus of the Washington Post that "the Obama administration has used the Espionage Act to go after whistleblowers who leaked to journalists ... more than all previous administrations combined." On one level, a simple tally would address Tapper’s claim and -- spoiler alert -- the raw numbers back him up. But a scrupulous vetting of the record uncovers important ambiguities in the entire business of talking about leaks in Washington. The basic numbers Most tallies, like the one by the investigative service ProPublica, begin with Daniel Ellsberg and the release of the Vietnam War era documents known as the Pentagon Papers. Including Ellsberg, the government has used the Espionage Act 10 times to prosecute government workers who shared classified information with journalists. If we push back to 1945, there is one more case. So of those 11, seven have taken place while Barack Obama has been president. Law professor David Pozen at Columbia University, has researched the culture of unauthorized disclosures in the nation’s capital and said generally, there has been an uptick in these prosecutions on Obama’s watch.. "There’s not really any doubt," Pozen said."The spirit of the assertion is correct." The whistleblower label debate The Justice Department does not quibble about number of prosecutions but in a statement to PunditFact, the department said: "It is definitely not the case that anyone who leaks classified information is a whistleblower. Very few of those prosecuted in recent years for unauthorized disclosures even sought to be considered that way." To take a couple of examples, in 2010, State Department contractor Stephen Kim was indicted for providing information about North Korea to Fox News. Later that year, Jeffrey Sterling, a Central Intelligence Agency officer, was indicted for sharing information with a journalist James Risen about America’s work to counter Iran’s nuclear program. Both defendants have pled not guilty. There is little suggestion that whatever they might have revealed had to do with any government abuse or that the leakers wanted to raise broad policy concerns. The Legal Information Institute at Cornell School of Law defines a whistleblower as "an employee who alleges wrongdoing by his or her employer of the sort that violates public law or tends to injure a considerable number of people." No matter how broadly interpreted, Kim and Stirling don’t seem to fit that definition. In a statement given to ProPublica, the Justice Department said it does not target whistleblowers who follow the rules, but "we cannot sanction or condone federal employees who knowingly and willfully disclose classified information to the media or others not entitled to receive such information." We raised this issue of who is and isn’t a whistleblower with Tapper and he said in the fast pace of a live interview, he might have wanted to use slightly different words to make his point. "It would be better to say ‘leakers, many of whom are seen as whistleblowers,’ instead of just ‘whistleblowers’," Tapper said. "If for no other reason that the focus would be on the administration’s aggressive use of the Espionage Act to clamp down on whistleblowing and journalism that holds the U.S. government accountable." As for the claim, though, it does not matter much. If you pull out the Kim and Stirling cases, by the same standard, you’d likely drop one of the pre-Obama cases too and that would still leave the Obama administration using the Espionage Act five times compared to three times before he took office. The mechanics of prosecutions Other factors could muddy the tally. The Obama administration inherited two of the cases from President George W. Bush’s Department of Justice. The indictments took place under Obama but "the wheels started turning before him," Pozen said. So potentially, someone could argue that these cases are not really his prosecutions. On the other hand, that doesn’t affect the technical accuracy of Tapper’s claim. In addition, administrations have a variety of ways to crack down on unauthorized disclosures. Tapper’s focus on the Espionage Act might be accurate, but it overlooks other tactics used by previous White House regimes, said Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center at New York University School of Law. "Instead of criminally prosecuting media leaks, the government has relied on administrative sanctions and penalties," Goitein said. These are extremely difficult to track because just about all of the details are protected by personal privacy laws. Goitein pointed to other laws that can and have been brought to bear, including Section 641 of Title 18 in the U.S. Code. It prohibits theft of government property. It was used in 2002 against a Drug Enforcement Agency official who gave sensitive, not classified, information to a London newspaper. While capital punishment isn’t an option, in other respects, a conviction under Section 641 can be just as harsh as a violation under the Espionage Act. But neither a charge of theft nor an administrative sanction change the accuracy of the specific details in Tapper’s claim. A look at the reasons behind the uptick under Obama lies outside the scope of this fact-check. For a complete discussion, we recommend Pozen’s recent article, "The leaky leviathan:Why the government condemns and condones unauthorized disclosures of information." Among other factors, digital technology both makes leakers easier to find and opens the door to disclosures on a grand scale as in the Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden cases. Our ruling Tapper said more than all previous administrations combined, the Obama administration has used the Espionage Act to go after whistleblowers who leak to journalists. The number of cases involving that law support Tapper’s statement. There is reasonable debate over whether the whistleblower label applies to all cases and Tapper said he could have been more precise. However, the Justice Department does not challenge the basic figures and the experts we contacted affirmed the general accuracy of the claim. We rate the statement True.

pomt-01842	"In New York, your chances of getting murdered are 1 in 25,000. In Honduras, it’s 1 in 14."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/16/cokie-roberts/cokie-roberts-chances-getting-murdered-new-york-ar/	After a bloody Fourth of July weekend in Chicago and a humanitarian crisis ensuing at the borders, the country’s politicos remain divided over how to address violence at home and those escaping violence abroad. There’s no doubt that the 52,000 unaccompanied minors arriving at the U.S border this year are fleeing high crime and high poverty. What to do about them is a different question. For ABC pundit Cokie Roberts, the staggering murder rates of Central America make immigration reform a moral no-brainer. "I heard a report this week that in New York, your chances of getting murdered are 1 in 25,000," said Roberts on This Week on July 13, 2014. "In Honduras, it’s 1 in 14. You can’t send children back home to that." A reader asked us about Roberts’ statistic, which we were curious about as well. What we found is an interesting case study of how wrong information gets spread, and how corrections don’t always work. He said, she said Roberts said she heard the statistic on the July 10, 2014, episode of MSNBC’s Morning Joe. On that show, economic analyst Steve Rattner used United Nations data in a discussion about immigration reform with host Joe Scarborough. "Let me put this in perspective for you," Rattner said. "In Honduras, you had a 1 in 14 chance of being murdered. In the city of New York, you have a 1 in 25,000 chance of being murdered. I can’t even imagine what it’s like to be in a place like that." When we reached out to Rattner’s researcher, Sundas Hashmi, she said that these rates "were unfortunately incorrect" and resulted from a transcription error. Rattner corrected the mistake on his Twitter the same day. But the false fact flew past Roberts, who doesn’t tweet. "Those of us who refuse to use social media sometimes miss things. But not enough to use social media," Roberts wrote us in an email. "And now I will return to writing about the 1850s, where tweeting only came from birds." Nonetheless, let’s look at the numbers. The odds are not in Honduras’ favor So to figure out your chances of getting murdered in Honduras or New York City, we first need the murder rates of both places. According to data from the United Nations, Honduras has the world’s highest murder rate: 90.4 murders per 100,000 people. Honduran sources report lower rates of about 75 to 80 homicides per 100,000 people, though criminal justice professor Frank Zimring says the margin of error "that far into the stratosphere" makes the difference trivial. Honduras’ deadliest city, San Pedro Sula, is also the world’s deadliest, with 187 murders per 100,000 people, reports Mexican think tank Seguridad Justicia Y Paz. In New York City, the FBI reported 419 homicides in a population of around 8.3 million in 2012. This comes out to a rate of about 5.1 homicides per 100,000 people. The U.S. averaged a rate of 4.7 in the same year. Here’s two charts that underscore the disparity between Honduras and New York: We then need to put that data into the same context as Roberts’ numbers-- your chances of getting murdered. That requires average lifespan data, which is reported by World Bank (73 years in Honduras and 79 years in the U.S.). With that information, we can calculate your chances of getting murdered in Honduras and New York in one year and in a lifetime. The discrepancy is big, but not as big as Roberts stated: Chances of being murdered Per year Per lifetime What Roberts said Honduras 1 in 1100 1 in 15 1 in 14 U.S. 1 in 21,000 1 in 270 San Pedro Sula 1 in 530 1 in 7 New York 1 in 20,000 1 in 250 1 in 25,000 As you can see from the chart above, the chances of getting murdered in Honduras are 1 in 1100 per year compared to 1 in 20,000 per year in New York. Over a lifetime, the chances of being murdered in Honduras are 1 in 15, compared to 1 in 250 in New York. That makes Honduras more dangerous but not nearly to the levels Roberts described. What Rattner may have done, and what Roberts repeated, was compare figures approaching the chances of being murdered in Honduras in a lifetime (1 in 15) to the chances of being murdered in New York in one year (1 in 20,000). Behind the numbers Even if Roberts (and Rattner) used the statistic correctly, criminologists warned us about using the figures to make comparisons. Crime rates are usually given as the number of crimes committed per 100,000 to account for different population sizes. This makes it easier to compare violence, according to Harold Pollack, co-director of the University of Chicago Crime Lab. "In Chicago, for example, we have the most amount of homicides, but we’re also a large city," he said. Averaged out over population size, Detroit, New Orleans and 18 other American cities have higher rates than Chicago’s." Since the general rates don’t capture the demographic of the victims, the chances of getting murdered will vary greatly. For example, men are more likely to be murdered than women, because homicide victims tend to match the profiles of homicide offenders across the world, Zimring said. According to The Economist, men in Honduras have a 1 in 599 chance of getting murdered every year, or 1 in 9 over a lifetime (assuming a life expectancy of 71 years). Geography, race, and age are also factors. "The risks are extremely uneven, depending on where you are and who you are," Zimring said. "In Honduras, if you’re a male, (the chances) are pretty good. If you’re a child, that doesn’t tell your chances in the next five years but when you turn 16, life gets pretty tough. So these numbers are simultaneously misleading and accurate." Zimring also cautions against comparing apples to oranges, particularly since one hot spot for typically drug-related murders in Honduras can skyrocket the entire country’s rate. New York’s rate actually gives a sense of what a safe large American city looks like, said Pollack. According to FBI data, Flint, Mich., has the country’s highest murder rate, 62 murders per 100,000 people, which is closer to Honduras’s murder rate but still pales in comparison to San Pedro Sula’s. So even if you’re comparing the deadliest cities in America to their Honduran equivalents, the Central American ones are much worse. The bottom line, experts and pundits agree, is that Honduras is a much more dangerous place. "Their murder rates put ours in perspective," Pollack said. "Even with all of those magnifications, you still don’t want to move to Honduras to feel safe," Zimring said. The ruling Roberts said, "In New York, your chances of getting murdered are 1 in 25,000. In Honduras, it’s 1 in 14." Roberts said she got the statistic from Rattner, who first reported the number on Morning Joe. But Rattner acknowledged that his figures were inaccurate and posted a correction on Twitter after the show. Roberts doesn’t have a Twitter account, and so she repeated Rattner’s wrong figures a few days later on ABC’s This Week. That’s how the bad statistic got spread, but Roberts and Rattner do have a point. The chances of getting murdered in Honduras are greater than they are in New York or the United States -- just not to the degree that they said. We rate the claim Half True.

"Police discover meth lab in back room of Alabama Walmart," stated a headline on the website ufconly.com on Dec. 10. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. This article is bogus. The same story appeared in March 2017 on the website Empire News, a website with a disclaimer that it is for entertainment purposes only. The story said that police received an anonymous tip about a horrible burning smell from the back of the Walmart. An officer discovered a meth lab that took up the entire back room. The story stated that an "unofficial spokesperson did say that they were ‘disappointed’ that they weren’t able to use their company discount to get meth before the place was shut down." One sign that this story is fake news: It provides a lengthy quote from "Chief Robert Garner," even though in Decatur the police chief’s name is Nate Allen. He told PolitiFact that there was no such bust. "This is fake news, and no, we don’t have a Chief Robert Garner," Allen said in an email. Tara Aston, a spokeswoman for Walmart, told PolitiFact in an email that the company was unaware of any meth lab being discovered at an Alabama store. While we found no news reports about busts of meth labs inside an Alabama Walmart, we did find some news reports about busts involving mobile meth labs in Walmart parking lots. In August 2016, police discovered a meth lab inside a 6-foot-high drainage pipe under a Walmart parking lot in Amherst, N.Y. The "about" section of the Ufconly website doesn’t describe the website’s content and instead stated that "Ufconly is a small village in the mountains of the Western Cape, South Africa." We found no such place. There is no evidence that police discovered a meth lab inside a Walmart in Decatur, Ala. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-04097	U.S. Senate candidate Todd Akin was "partly right" that a woman's body has a way of shutting down so that a pregnancy doesn't occur if she's raped.	false	/georgia/statements/2013/jan/16/phil-gingrey/gingrey-defense-akins-rape-comments-misses-mark/	So you might have heard that U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey of Marietta got himself into some trouble last week when he talked about rape. Gingrey, now in his sixth term in the House, said fellow Republican Todd Akin of Missouri was "partly right" when Akin said last year that a woman’s body has a way of shutting down if she’s raped to prevent pregnancy. PolitiFact Georgia wanted to see whether there was any accuracy to Gingrey’s remarks. "[I]n a situation of rape, a legitimate rape, a woman’s body has a way of shutting down so the pregnancy would not occur," Gingrey said during a question-and-answer segment at a meeting Thursday of the Smyrna Area Council of the Cobb Chamber of Commerce. "[Akin’s] partly right on that." Gingrey, an obstetrician/gynecologist who said he’s delivered more than 5,200 babies, explained some more. "And I’ve delivered lots of babies, and I know about these things. It is true. We tell infertile couples all the time that are having trouble conceiving because of the woman not ovulating, ‘Just relax. Drink a glass of wine. And don’t be so tense and uptight because all that adrenaline can cause you not to ovulate.’ So he was partially right, wasn’t he? But the fact that a woman may have already ovulated 12 hours before she is raped, you’re not going to prevent a pregnancy there by a woman’s body shutting anything down because the horse has already left the barn, so to speak. And yet the media took that and tore it apart." Akin later apologized for his remarks and said rape can lead to pregnancy. His initial comments were largely cited as the reason Akin lost his campaign for a U.S. Senate seat. Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who feared Akin’s comments would hurt him with women voters, gave Akin a verbal stiff arm. Gingrey said Akin’s remarks weren’t helpful. Gingrey’s effort to clarify what Akin said, first reported in The Marietta Daily Journal in its Friday editions, made the rounds within hours on several national political websites. The Democratic Party leader in Gingrey’s district has already announced plans to challenge the incumbent next year. On Monday, Gingrey’s Twitter site, deluged with criticism of Gingrey’s remarks, had been removed. Gingrey sent The Atlanta Journal-Constitution a statement Friday. "I do not defend, nor do I stand by, the remarks made by Rep. Akin. … In my attempt to provide context as to what I presumed they meant, my position was misconstrued," Gingrey said. Gingrey’s office did not respond to our messages for further comment. Some doctors and organizations said there is no accuracy to the Georgia congressman’s claims. "While chronic severe stress and anxiety may impact fertility sometimes, the fact is that a woman cannot prevent ovulation or conception with their emotions, especially in an acute traumatic situation like rape," said Barbara Croft, a board-certified OB/GYN based in Atlanta who has been in practice for 30 years. Croft called Gingrey’s comments patronizing, condescending and unscientific. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, a Washington, D.C.-based organization with about 56,000 members, including Croft, echoed her comments. "While chronic stress, for example from extreme exposure to famine or war, may decrease a woman’s ability to conceive, there is no scientific evidence that adrenaline, experienced in an acute stress situation, has an impact on ovulation," the group told us via email. Gingrey is a fellow with the organization, which is defined as a board-certified OB/GYN whose professional activity is devoted to the practice of obstetrics and/or gynecology. For decades, some politicians and newsmakers -- mostly social conservatives -- have said women who are raped are less likely to become pregnant. Their definition of a legitimate rape is a woman who is sexually assaulted. The Washington Post reported that National Right to Life President John Wilke wrote an essay in 1999 that the "physical trauma" of rape has a way of preventing pregnancy. The newspaper’s website has a link to the essay. The link contains an analysis of Akin’s remarks by the Rev. Robert Fleischmann, the national director of Christian Life Resources. "Statistically speaking, it appears something happens in a rape, either with the victim or with the perpetrator, that reduces the incidence of pregnancy," Fleischmann wrote in August. "Fertility specialists continually debate the role of emotions, unresolved conflicts and trauma play in female infertility." There is some discussion on websites such as FertilityFactor.com that severe stress, eating disorders, excess exercise or extreme weight loss can interfere with regular menstruation. Some studies widely reported by news outlets conclude that the rate of rape-related pregnancy is higher than the rate of pregnancy from consensual sex. The likelihood of a rape-related pregnancy is usually in the 5 percent range, the studies show. Most of these studies, though, were done in the 1980s or 1990s. The Chicago Tribune, citing a Mayo Clinic publication about infertility, reported in August that mental stress can temporarily alter an area of the brain that controls the hormones that regulate a woman’s menstrual cycle. The Tribune article reported that it is a chronic kind of situation that occurs over months or years, not the acute trauma of a rape. Our conclusion: Gingrey said it’s "partly right" that a woman's body has a way of shutting down so that a pregnancy doesn't occur if she's raped. There is some information that suggests that some conditions, particularly stress, can reduce fertility. But our research found it is not typically the stress of a rape. There’s scant scientific evidence to support Gingrey’s argument. We rate his statement False.	None	Phil Gingrey	None	None	None	2013-01-16T06:00:00	2013-01-10	['United_States', 'Todd_Akin']
pomt-09380	"Just this week we received the news that for the first time Social Security is now paying out more in benefits than it's taking in. That was something that was supposed to happen in 2016."	true	/florida/statements/2010/mar/28/marco-rubio/rubio-claims-social-security-upside-down-sooner-ex/	During the first primary debate between Gov. Charlie Crist and Marco Rubio, the former House speaker said that Social Security needs to be reformed or it will go bankrupt. "Social Security, whether we want it to or not, in its current form cannot survive and will not exist for us," he said during the March 28, 2010, showdown on FOX News Sunday. "In fact, just this week we received the news that for the first time Social Security is now paying out more in benefits than it's taking in. That was something that was supposed to happen in 2016. It's now happening in 2010." Calls to reform Social Security are nothing new; many economic analysts say that the program is unsustainable. But privatizing the program has become a hallmark of the conservative agenda. Its latest proponent is Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan, who is the top Republican on the U.S. House of Representatives' Budget Committee. His Roadmap for America's Future would reduce Social Security benefits for those who are 55 or younger in 2011 and supplement the reduction with private accounts. On March 24, that argument was put in the spotlight again, when the Congressional Budget Office, the independent number-crunching arm of Congress, issued some sobering news: This year, the Social Security Administration will take in less than it pays out, resulting in an approximately $29 billion shortfall. The projections are part of its yearly analysis of President Barack Obama's budget. In an interview with the New York Times, Stephen C. Goss, chief actuary of the SSA, explained the problem. He said that the recession has put people out of jobs and more people have applied for benefits sooner than expected. Simultaneously, fewer jobs means fewer paychecks are going out and that translates to less collected by the government in taxes. In the same interview, Gross pointed out that the SSA has a $2.5 trillion balance that will carry benefits for a while. So, Rubio's correct on the first part his claim. He's right on his second point as well. In its May 2009 annual report to Congress, the SSA projected that "annual cost will exceed tax income starting in 2016." As a result, we find Rubio's claim to be True.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2010-03-28T16:14:21	2010-03-28	['None']
pomt-01275	"Jeanne Shaheen was principally involved in a plot with Lois Lerner and President Barack Obama’s political appointee at the IRS to lead a program of harassment against conservative nonprofit groups during the 2012 election"	false	/new-hampshire/statements/2014/nov/04/daily-caller/jeanne-shaheen-hit-last-minute-attack-over-lois-le/	By the time the sun came up on Election Day, a charge against Sen. Jeanne Shaheen -- the New Hampshire Democrat in a nip-and-tuck race for another term -- had begun making the rounds on social media. The Daily Caller, a web-based publication aligned with conservatives, ran a story headlined, "BOMBSHELL MEMO: Jeanne Shaheen Conspired With White House Insider On IRS Targeting Scandal." The story was posted at 9:36 p.m. the night before the election. The story accuses Shaheen of being "principally involved in a plot with Lois Lerner and President Barack Obama’s political appointee at the IRS to lead a program of harassment against conservative nonprofit groups during the 2012 election." The night before Election Day is an unusually late moment for a "bombshell" to emerge in a Senate contest. But readers asked PolitiFact to take a look, even if our analysis would be published well into Election Day. So we did. Early in the election cycle, New Hampshire Republican Party Chairwoman Jennifer Horn said that Shaheen "got behind the idea of using the IRS to target American citizens for their political views." In our fact-check published Oct. 23, 2013, we concluded that what Shaheen actually "got behind" was the DISCLOSE Act, which requires nonprofit groups to share information about their campaign contributions. We determined that it was a stretch to suggest that Shaheen favored going after citizens "for their political views," so we rated Horn’s statement Mostly False. Tuesday’s story is a little different because it accuses Shaheen of being part of a "plot" of harassment against conservative groups. As evidence the story cited "letters exclusively obtained by the Daily Caller." Those letters were the result of a Freedom of Information request that was fulfilled on Oct. 9, 2014, according to documents provided to PolitiFact New Hampshire. Of the nine pages of documents provided, five of them reprint letters from Shaheen and six other Democratic Senators to Douglas Shulman, Commissioner of the IRS, asking the IRS to investigate any nonprofits that are avoiding being taxed while they "are focused on federal election activities." The remaining four pages are responses to that request. The IRS was noncommittal in its responses to making any changes. "To ensure that section 501(c)(4) organizations meet the requirements for tax exemption under the Internal Revenue Code, the IRS has ongoing programs that review the activities of organizations seeking IRS recognition of tax exemption," wrote Steve T. Miller, Deputy Commissioner for Services and Enforcement in his response dated April 26, 2012. He later added, "The IRS is aware of the public interest in this issue. These regulations have been effect since 1959. We will consider proposed changes in this area as we work with the IRS Office of Chief Counsel and the Treasury Department’s Office of Tax Policy." The letters themselves are not secretive. The first, dated Feb. 16, 2012, was signed by Sens. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Al Franken (D-Minn.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Tom Udall (D-N.M.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.). It has been publicly available for more than a year; Shaheen’s signature comes on the third page. The second letter, signed by the same seven senators and dated March 9, 2012, was even the subject of a press release by Schumer. What the letters say The letter dated Feb. 16, 2012, asks the IRS to review its oversight of 501(c)(4) organizations that get involved in politics. (The name refers to a section of the tax code.) The Internal Revenue Code grants tax-exempt status for nonprofit organizations that promote "social welfare." But Shaheen’s letter said some groups abuse tax-exempt privileges by calling themselves social welfare organizations while spending a majority of their money on influencing politics. The letter says the code specifies that social welfare "does not include direct or indirect participation or intervention in political campaigns on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for political office." The letter first came to prominence in 2013 after publication of a report from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration that concluded that the IRS had improperly targeted conservative groups. Some Republicans cited the letter as evidence that Democrats were responsible for such actions. Meanwhile, the letter to the IRS commissioner dated March 9, 2012, did encourage the IRS to change the way it handles nonprofit organizations that spend money on politics, suggesting three changes, including that the organizations document the exact percentage of their money that goes toward social welfare. We don’t see how these letters support the linchpins of the claim -- that Shaheen was "involved in a plot," that this plot involved Lerner and other Obama appointees, or that the issue concerned a "program of harassment against conservative nonprofit groups." Webster’s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary defines this type of "plot" as "a secret plan for accomplishing a usually evil or unlawful end." The letters were not secret, and, while we won’t take a position on whether their effort was "evil," they were clear that they wanted the IRS to adhere to the law, not break it. In addition, there is no mention of Lois Lerner -- the central figure in the controversy -- and no obvious connection to any Obama political appointee other than Schulman, who was actually appointed by President George W. Bush in 2008. As for a "program of harassment against conservative nonprofit groups," the letters do not urge a partisan or ideological focus to the effort. They point to 501(c)(4) nonprofits generally, not conservative groups alone. The Daily Caller did not return our request for comment. Our ruling The Daily Caller charged that Shaheen "was principally involved in a plot with Lois Lerner and President Barack Obama’s political appointee at the IRS to lead a program of harassment against conservative nonprofit groups during the 2012 election." Shaheen and six other Democratic Senators did send letters broadly connected to the issue of scrutinizing the activities of nonprofit groups. Their concern was that some groups abuse tax-exempt privileges by calling themselves social welfare organizations while spending a majority of their money on influencing politics. The Daily Caller article amps up the innuendo beyond the evidence. The letters weren’t secret, they didn’t cite Lerner or other Obama appointees, and they didn’t single out conservative groups. We rate the claim False.	None	Daily Caller	None	None	None	2014-11-04T17:51:04	2014-11-03	['None']
pomt-11741	"The FBI has become America's secret police … like the old KGB."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/dec/08/gregg-jarrett/has-fbi-become-americas-secret-police/	A Fox News legal commentator argued the FBI has become the new KGB, the Soviet-era secret police, during a segment of Hannity. Here’s the exchange between Gregg Jarrett and the show’s host, Sean Hannity, during the Dec. 6, 2017, edition: Jarrett: "I think we now know that the (Robert) Mueller investigation is illegitimate and corrupt. And Mueller has been using the FBI as a political weapon. And the FBI has become America's secret police. Secret surveillance, wiretapping, intimidation, harassment and threats. It's like the old KGB that comes for you in the dark of the night banging through your door." Hannity: "By the way, this is not a game. This is not hyperbole you are using here." Jarrett: "No. Ask Paul Manafort, they came for him and broke through his front door." Hannity: "And if it can happen to him, Gregg…." Jarrett: "It can happen to all of us. Absolutely. The FBI is a shadow government now." Are today’s FBI and yesterday’s KGB really interchangeable? Jarrett and Hannity said it wasn’t hyperbole. We checked with a range of experts in the history of both agencies, and even those who are no fans of past and present FBI practices say the comparison is wrongheaded. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett The statement "is over the top and ridiculous," said Douglas Charles, a historian at Penn State University Greater Allegheny and author of three books on the FBI, including J. Edgar Hoover and the Anti-interventionists: FBI Political Surveillance and the Rise of the Domestic Security State. "And I say this as an FBI historian who has long been critical of the bureau's history, its political surveillance, its use of illegal wiretaps, its harassment of the LGBT community, and its promotion of ‘morality’ issues." To be sure, some of the tactics Jarrett cited are used by the FBI, or more broadly by law enforcement agencies in the United States. The pre-dawn, break-down-the-door raid ordered at a house owned by Manafort -- President Donald Trump’s former campaign chairman now under indictment on several counts involving his foreign lobbying business -- is not especially unusual. Such raids are more common in drug investigations than in white collar crime, according to Radley Balko, a criminal justice blogger for the Washington Post and author of Rise of the Warrior Cop: The Militarization of America's Police Forces. Meanwhile, law enforcement has the ability to conduct warrantless wiretaps under certain circumstances, despite the longstanding opposition of civil liberties groups. A category of subpoena called a "national security letter" provides "a law-enforcement officer with broad discretion or authority to search and seize unspecified places or persons," said John Pike, director of globalsecurity.org. National security letters have been used to trawl through "customer records held by banks, telephone companies, Internet service providers, and others," who are then prevented from telling anyone about these searches, according to the Electronic Privacy Information Center. However, the use of such tools does not make the FBI, or any other U.S. law enforcement agency, the same as a secret police agency such as the old KGB. For one thing, those tactics sometimes may be needed. "Breaking down front doors in the dark of night is a bit melodramatic, but it is probably necessary to avoid destruction of evidence," Pike said. (Preventing destruction of evidence was the reported justification for the Manafort raid.) "Legitimate concerns about the increase in law enforcement’s surveillance capacity over the last decade or so are de-legitimized by such a specious pairing of agencies," said Victor E. Kappeler, a criminologist at Eastern Kentucky University and co-author of Policing in America and Homeland Security. Here are some of the reasons why any comparison between the two agencies is problematic. • Just because the FBI sometimes operates in secret does not mean that it’s a "secret police." "By 'secret police,' we do not mean 'police activity that is secret' any more than by 'public interest' we mean 'what the public is interested in,' " said Anthony Glees, director of the Center for Security and Intelligence Studies at the University of Buckingham and the author of The Stasi Files: The UK Operations of the East German Intelligence and Security Service. Indeed, the very fact that a legal analyst can criticize the FBI on a national television broadcast is a significant departure from anything that would be possible in a country with a true secret police. • The FBI is run by laws, not by whim. The KGB -- which translates from the Russian acronym for Committee for State Security -- answered to and served the interests of the Communist Party, not any system of law. Put simply, "the FBI is subject to the laws limiting police powers," said Joseph Wippl, a former clandestine Central Intelligence Agency officer who now teaches at Boston University. "These laws were passed by a Congress elected by the U.S. population. These laws can be changed, either restricting or expanding police powers." Robert Mueller, the special counsel, "needs to work within an independent judicial system to get search warrants and to indict suspects, whereas in the Soviet Union, there was generally no meaningful judicial oversight of the secret police," said Edward Cohn, a Grinnell College historian and author of The High Title of a Communist. "And KGB efforts at intimidation and surveillance often went beyond anything the FBI is accused of doing." Simon Ball, the chair of international history and politics at the University of Leeds and author of The Cold War: An International History 1947-1991, agreed. "The contemporary U.S. political system and the Soviet political system of 1954, when the KGB was formed, are not comparable in any sensible analytical scheme," he said. • The FBI doesn’t torture or carry out extrajudicial executions. "The KGB carried out the repression of a totalitarian state that murdered tens of millions of innocent people in the name of a political ideology," said Gregory Feifer a journalist and author of Russians: The People Behind the Power. "Whatever one thinks about the FBI — with its many faults and occasional moves toward KGB-like surveillance of government critics over the years — it is an integral part of our rule-of-law society." A secret police like the KGB operates "through the institutionalised use of torture," Glees said. By contrast, "any use of unnecessary violence, let alone torture, would be met with the full force of the criminal law." Even as bad as the Hoover-era FBI was about civil liberties and abuse of power, Charles said, "it was still no KGB-like organization coming for people in the dead of night who were then ‘disappeared.’ " Indeed, he said, the excesses of Hoover’s tenure were, to a large extent, curbed after his death by the ordinary workings of the democratic process. Pike of globalsecurity.org said that, while there’s a need for vigilance, "there does seem to have been a remarkable absence of abuses of these far-reaching powers." He added, "Whatever happens to you down at the J.Edgar Hoover building, you are pretty confident it will not entail a bullet to the back of the head." A Fox News representative did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Our ruling Jarrett said that "the FBI has become America's secret police … "The FBI has become America's secret police … like the old KGB." He also agreed with Hannity that the statement was not an exaggeration. Numerous historians of the FBI and the KGB say the comparison is ridiculous. The KGB implemented the goals of the Communist Party leadership, including countless examples of tortures and summary executions. The FBI, by contrast, is subject to the rule of law and is democratically accountable. We rate the statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-02865	"Our national debt is as low as it has been since World War II."	false	/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/14/goldie-taylor/msnbc-contributor-goldie-taylor-says-national-debt/	MSNBC contributor Goldie Taylor joined the Rev. Al Sharpton on MSNBC’s PoliticsNation on Tuesday to criticize former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin for comparing the national debt to slavery. Sharpton said Palin’s comments were not only offensive but wrong on the facts, as the national debt "has been reduced every year for the last five years under this president." Taylor responded, "You know, our national debt is as low as it has been since World War II. And so the notion that our national debt is growing at some astronomical rate really is a misnomer." We thought their claims were ripe for a PunditFact review. We rated Sharpton’s comment False, and for a pretty basic reason. Sharpton mixed up the deficit with the debt. The budget words sort of sound alike, but they’re not interchangeable. The deficit is a yearly measure of revenues against spending, and the debt is the sum of all past deficits minus any annual surpluses. Taylor made a similar mix-up as she misconstrued a larger talking point we’ve heard from the Obama administration this year. The deal with debt Taylor’s statement is off no matter how you slice it. * In raw dollars: Gross federal debt is at an historic high of $17.1 trillion, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. When President Barack Obama took office in 2009, it was $10.6 trillion. (The debt grew by $4.9 trillion under President George W. Bush. Under Obama, it is poised to double.) * As a percentage of the national economy, commonly measured as the Gross Domestic Product: The debt as a percentage of GDP reached 103 percent in 2012 after a steady climb since 2009, according to tables from the White House Office of Management and Budget. The debt as a percentage of GDP had not been that high since 1947, when it was 110.3 percent. The story is the same for the 2012 federal deficit, which fell to 7 percent of GDP but was larger than any year since the end of World War II. In fact, as University of California Berkeley law professor Alan Auerbach pointed out, the federal government had budget surpluses while Bill Clinton was president. "Whether you look at the debt or the deficit, it is clearly false that the figures are smaller than anything since WWII," said Princeton University economist Harvey Rosen. ‘What I should have said’ On Twitter, Taylor told us she should have said, "The deficit is falling at its fastest rate since WWII." That statement, borrowed from Obama team talking points, would have been more accurate. PolitiFact previously reviewed Obama’s claim that "our deficits are falling at the fastest rate in 60 years" and rated it True. The deficit was 10.1 percent of GDP in 2009, but fell in 2012 to 7 percent -- a decline of 3.1 percentage points. The period between 1946 and 1949, when the deficit as a percentage of GDP fell 7.4 percentage points, produced the only bigger decline. Experts have criticized Obama’s point as misleading. The recent drop is happening because the deficit was so large to begin with that it had more room to fall. The government ran the largest budget deficits relative to the GDP during 2009 and 2012 than since 1946, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, and this is causing the debt "to soar." The debt’s long-term growth "is very worrisome given the risks it poses and the time needed to reverse the upward trajectory of debt," said Jason Peuquet, research fellow at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. And for all of the crowing about the reduced deficit, CBO expects it to increase again in the next decade due to spending on programs for our aging population, health costs, new subsidies to offset the cost of health insurance, and larger interest payments on the debt. Our ruling Taylor said, "Our national debt is as low as it has been since World War II," which is plainly incorrect. The debt is as high as it’s ever been, in terms of real dollars, and it ticks up by the second. Taylor acknowledged her flub, tweeting us that she will work on "slowing things down a bit to make sure I get it right." Her statement on PoliticsNation rates False.

pomt-03428	Says proposed teacher contract "would layer on more restrictive rules."	true	/oregon/statements/2013/jun/25/portland-public-schools/does-proposed-portland-teacher-contract-include-mo/	Contract negotiations are always a tense time, but the battle between the Portland Association of Teachers and the Portland Public School Board is getting particularly heated. Teachers say they're simply trying to outline their responsibilities as clearly as possible, while board members say the contract could negatively impact children's education. In an opinion piece published in The Oregonian June 5, board members argued that the proposal currently floated by the teachers' association "would layer on more restrictive rules." In the piece, they say the proposed contract does this by: "Prohibiting increases in instructional time in any school above the amount currently in place." "Preventing teachers from being required to communicate with parents or post grades online, unless 30 minutes of time is set aside to do so during the school day." "Prohibiting principals from having teachers make up parent-teacher conferences with families who miss their regularly scheduled meetings." Then, the board members really hammer it home: "Students and families deserve better. These demands exemplify much of what is already wrong with Portland's teacher contract." The analysis: PolitiFact Oregon was curious about whether the contract was really such a game changer, so we pulled up a copy of the contract and found the passages that the board members were talking about. Let's take these one by one. First up: Prohibiting an increase in instructional time. On Page 89 of the proposed contract, which is still undergoing tweaks, it specifically states that "Instructional minutes and/or student contact minutes shall not increase in any building above what is in effect during the 2012-2013 school year." Second: Preventing teachers from being required to post grades online or communicate with parents unless they're given specific time during the workday to do this. Page 94 of the contract has passages that address both of these issues. The proposed contract notes that "professional educators recognize the value and importance of communication with parents and the community, and may volunteer to do so using print, electronic or digital communication products." The key here, though, is requiring the teachers to do this -- and the proposed contract specifically says that should not occur: "Principals/supervisors shall not require such parent communication unless adequate additional time is allowed during the workday … Principals/supervisors may not require parent newsletters or more frequent progress reporting unless adequate additional parent communication time of at least thirty (30) minutes daily is allowed during the workday to complete these tasks." The same page has a similar note about grading: "The electronic posting of assignments, grading rubrics, support materials, and lesson plans on electronic student information systems … is recognized as beneficial; however it shall not be required unless adequate additional parent communication time of at least thirty (30) minutes daily is allowed during the workday to complete these tasks." Third: Will principals be barred from requiring teachers to make up parent-teacher conferences with families that miss their meetings? This, too, is stated pretty explicitly in the proposed contract. The teachers association notes that "professional educators shall make arrangements as may be necessary to meet with students and parents at reasonable times during the normal workday." But it then goes on to say, directly, that, "principals shall not require professional educators to schedule make up appointments for parents who miss regularly scheduled parent conferences." Given that all of this language seems to fit with what was in the opinion piece, we were inclined to wrap this one up, but we did want to chat with Marty Pavlik, the Portland Association of Teachers' chief contract negotiator. Pavlik gave detailed defenses of each piece of the contract, noting some of it still had not been completely worked out. While we found much of his reasoning behind the provisions to be reasonable, none of it much changed that these clauses were indeed in the contact. There was one exception however. Pavlik said that the first issue, the one dealing with no increased instructional time, was actually not a new provision. In fact, he said, it was already covered by the contract's Maintenance of Standard Clause, which essentially keeps instructional minutes the same from year to year. This added line, he said, was simply there to clarify that time would not be added. "In our opinion," he said, "it is not a change." On that one, we agree. But ultimately we come back to the school board's statement, which is that this contract proposal would "layer on more restrictive rules." We also, with due diligence in mind, spoke with Portland Public School's chief spokesman, Robb Cowie. He said one thing that stuck with us: "In terms of accuracy, the board's statements in this (piece) are absolutely accurate and hew to the language that is in the proposal." The issues they cite are clearly based on pieces of the proposed contract. What's more, those pieces do serve to create more restrictive rules. Now, whether that's a bad thing depends on your position in the broader debate. And teachers would argue they need the rules to protect their time in the face of growing district mandates. But we're not ruling on that -- PolitiFact doesn't delve into opinions, positions or predictions. We're just ruling on whether the proposed contract creates more restrictive rules for these specific situations. Clearly it does. We rate this statement True.

pomt-01544	Says Dick Cheney "de-Ba’athisized the Iraqi government and created ISIS."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/15/chris-matthews/matthews-cheneys-post-saddam-tactic-created-isis/	Even as President Barack Obama rallies support to attack the forces of the Islamic State, the military group also known as ISIS and ISIL, he is taking barbs from both the hawks and the doves. The former, like Republican Arizona Sen. John McCain, back military engagement but skewer the president for having failed to act earlier. The doves doubt that a military response will do more than breed new enemies of the United States. This pincer movement galls Obama’s fans who feel he is unfairly blamed for a disaster he inherited. In the closing seconds of MSNBC’s coverage special immediately after the president’s address on ISIS on Sept. 10, Hardball host Chris Matthews leveled this dig at a major backer of the original invasion of Iraq, former Vice President Dick Cheney. "Do not listen to Dick Cheney," Matthews said. "He's the one that created al-Qaida by taking over the holy land in Saudi Arabia. He’s the one that de-Ba’athisized the Iraqi government and created ISIS." We set aside the reference to Saudi Arabia and decided to take a closer look at the link between Cheney, ISIS and Iraq. Through the MSNBC press office, we asked Matthews if he could expand on how Cheney created ISIS. We did not hear back. But we can fill in the blanks. Saddam Hussein wielded power through the Ba’ath party. For all practical purposes, leadership in the military and civilian sectors was synonymous with Ba’ath membership. Early in the occupation of Iraq, the George W. Bush administration decided to purge the Ba’athists. And we know that at least some of the success of ISIS on the battlefield is due to former generals and colonels under Hussein who have shaped the groups tactics and intelligence activities. Lina Khatib, director of the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut, said there is no doubt about this. "ISIS is indeed cooperating with former Ba'athists, especially military officers, who have been seminal in directing the group's military strategy," Khatib told PunditFact. So that’s a rough top line. But Matthew’s statement requires that we explore two points: Was Cheney responsible for de-Ba’athification? And how might that have led to the creation of ISIS? We heard from several researchers of ISIS and its origins. From them, and our review of the historic record, we find that this Ba’athist connection between Cheney and ISIS is real but it is indirect, and more factors than the expulsion of Ba’athist members from the Iraqi military fueled ISIS. Cheney and de-Ba’athification Thanks to a report from the special inspector general for Iraq reconstruction, we know that more than a year before the invasion of Iraq, the Bush administration began discussing plans to govern the country once coalition forces overthrew Hussein. A basic puzzle was this: to leave the Ba’athist leadership in place would give them the power to undermine anything the Americans might want. But to get rid of them wholesale risked chaos. In the words of former Secretary of State Colin Powell, "when you hit (Iraq), it’s like a crystal glass. It’s going to shatter." Initially, Bush signed off on a plan of "light" de-Ba’athification. While that term was never well defined, the general notion was that the most senior leaders would be removed, and mid-level managers would stay. In mid May 2003, about two months after the invasion began, a very different policy took effect. Under Ambassador Paul Bremmer, the man in charge of Iraq reconstruction, at least 20,000 government workers were fired. Then Bremmer disbanded the entire Iraqi military. According to the inspector general’s report "key U.S. generals on the ground in Iraq strongly opposed Bremer’s order. (They) anticipated using the Iraqi army to help stabilize the country and start the reconstruction process." Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, commander of coalition forces in Iraq in 2003 said, "essentially, (the move) eliminated the entire government and civic capacity of the nation." When challenged at the time, Bremmer insisted that his orders came from the White House and the Defense Department. We found some ambiguity on who issued those orders. De-Ba’athification has come to be seen in many quarters as such a pivotal error, no one has leaped forward to take credit. In addition to the inspector general’s report, there are two other assessments written by analysts with high-level access to insiders. One, from U.S. Army War College Strategic Studies Institute, reported that Bremmer was handed his instructions by an undersecretary of defense, Douglas Feith. "President Bush had previously given Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld managerial control of the occupation, so it is possible that Feith spoke for Rumsfeld who spoke for Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney," the institute report said. A report from the Rand Corporation, the grand-daddy of the private defense policy think tanks, said the National Security Council, "with President Bush in the chair," learned of the de-Ba’athfication order the day before it was implemented. "No one raised objections," the report said. However, the inspector general’s report finds that the move caught both the CIA and the State Department off guard. A body of information ties Cheney to this decision. Cheney played a key role on the National Security Council and in all decisions surrounding the war. His chief of staff Lewis "Scooter" Libby recruited Bremmer for his post in Iraq. Press reports at the time and analyses afterward put Cheney in a group of hard-liners within the White House and the Defense Department who sought to remake Iraq from the ground up. While Cheney might not have drafted the de-Ba’athification order himself, we can safely say he supported it. De-Ba’athification and ISIS Several key steps lie between the former Ba’ath leaders and the circumstances that ultimately produced ISIS. Peter Neumann, professor of security studies at King’s College London, said there is a tenuous link. "De-Baathification and the dissolution of the Army disenfranchised Iraqi Sunnis, creat(ed) the kind of resentment that fueled the Iraqi insurgency in the mid 2000s," Neumann said. "This helped al-Qaida in Iraq, ISIS's predecessor, and it's the same kind of resentment and mistrust towards Shiites that allowed ISIS to gain the support of Sunni tribes in its recent advances." Austin Long, security policy professor at Columbia University, argues that it is, "certainly correct that without the 2003 invasion, the ISIS would almost surely not exist." On the other hand, Long said many ex-Ba’athists turned against al-Qaida in Iraq between 2005 and 2007. Long, as did the other analysts we contacted, pointed a heavy finger of blame at former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. "It is really in the past four years, with the Maliki government really disenfranchising and even targeting many Sunnis, that the Islamic State has begun to find allies in the Sunni community again," Long said. "Matthews’ statement is not wrong in the sense that without an invasion and de-Ba'athification there would be no ISIS, but it elides the fact that Cheney was not in office for the critical period when ISIS began to regain support." William Braniff, executive director at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland, said ISIS draws its strength from powerful ideological beliefs and ethnic tensions. "The Ba’athists are useful, but not the drivers of this murderous movement," Braniff said. Beyond Maliki and de-Ba’athification, many factors led to the creation of ISIS, including the tactics of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, which played ISIS forces against other rebel groups, and some early funding linked to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait. The online news site Vox has an intriguing overview for those wishing to read more. Our ruling Matthews said Cheney de-Ba’athisized the Iraqi government and created ISIS. We find that Cheney played a key role in de-Ba’athification and in creating the circumstances that led to the formation of ISIS. Former Ba’athists provide important military ISIS leadership, as they did in the first few years after the invasion when they joined forces with the group that preceded ISIS, al-Qaida in Iraq. However, many of those same Ba’athists later turned against al-Qaida in Iraq. They shifted back into the orbit of what became ISIS due to the repressive policies under Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki. The causal link is too distant to say Cheney created ISIS. His decisions contributed to the group’s formation, but not more than that. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-04501	"We're up 123,000 jobs over the last year and three-quarters. We're actually, according to the Bureau of Labor statistics, down 500 ... auto jobs in Ohio."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2012/oct/05/john-kasich/while-ohio-123000-jobs-2011-auto-jobs-are-down-joh/	Ohio's economic condition is improving. That's good news for Gov. John Kasich, but it comes with an asterisk. An improving economy is also considered good news for President Barack Obama. Kasich, a Republican, backs challenger Mitt Romney. The point came up, as it has before, during a recent Fox News interview. "The Democrats are saying one of the big factors helping the president is the auto bailout, particularly in the northern part of the state," host Paul Gigot said, wondering if Kasich's boosting of jobs was helping Obama's campaign. Kasich, as he has before, downplayed the role of the auto recovery. "We're up 123,000 jobs over the last year and three-quarters," he said. "We're actually, according to the Bureau of Labor statistics, down 500 jobs, auto jobs in Ohio." A loss of jobs? PolitiFact Ohio was interested. We looked at figures from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, and we asked Kasich's office for his sourcing. First, we noted that Kasich, in talking about "the last year and three-quarters," was referring to the period from January 2011, when he took office, until August 2012, the last month for which figures were available. BLS figures for Ohio show that total nonfarm employment went in that period from 5,064,600 to 5,187,600 -- an increase of 123,000 jobs, as Kasich stated. In talking about auto jobs in that period, Kasich's staff said he was referring to jobs in the BLS categories of motor vehicle manufacturing and motor vehicle parts manufacturing. The first category saw an increase of 700 jobs from January 2011 to August 2012, from 19,200 to 19,900. In the second and larger category, employment went from 56,000 to 54,800, a loss of 1,200 jobs. That's a net decrease of 500 jobs. So Kasich’s numbers are correct. But additional information is needed to clarify his claim. The timeframe Kasich used is an issue in itself, as we have noted before. In talking about Ohio jobs, the governor only used figures that covered his time in office, starting in January 2011. But the first federal aid to the automakers was made in 2008 while Republican President George W. Bush was still in office. It continued in early 2009 under Obama. The auto industry hit bottom in June 2009, when vehicle manufacturing jobs in Ohio dropped to 14,200, down from 23,800 jobs one year earlier. By the time Kasich took office, after the auto bailouts, that number had increased by 5,000 jobs. That isn't reflected in the governor's tally. Parts manufacturing, down 1,200 jobs since Kasich took office, is up 3,900 jobs from the trough of June 2009. It is also worth noting that the figures the governor cited reflect only direct jobs in the auto industry. Some industry analysts, such as the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, also look at two other categories of employment in the industry -- intermediate and spin-off -- in considering the impact auto manufacturing has on the economy. Under that gauge, job growth in other businesses that have a connection to the auto industry also would be considered. On the Truth-O-Meter, a statement that is accurate but needs clarification or additional information rates Mostly True.

pomt-09537	"Barack Obama had 150 days in the U.S. Senate where he was able to vote quite often 'present.' "	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/08/sarah-palin/palin-says-obama-voted-present-us-senate-very-ofte/	In an interview with FoxNews.com at the National Tea Party Convention on Feb. 6, 2010, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin reprised a Republican talking point from the 2008 presidential campaign by criticizing President Barack Obama for his lack of executive experience. Asked by FoxNews.com's Judd Berger whether she thought she's "more qualified to be president than President Obama," Palin referred to the debate over "experience" from the 2008 contest between Obama and her running mate, Arizona Sen. John McCain: "The whole qualification issue still perplexes me, because in the campaign we tried to bring attention to the fact that Obama had really not a lot of experience. And I do say that my executive experience, as an administrator, as a team manager if you will was, and so was John McCain's as a matter of fact, was stronger and we had more experience than Barack Obama did in terms of managing huge multibillion dollar budgets and thousands of employees that I had just come from a position of that and that hasn't changed." When Berger asked Palin, "But without McCain?" -- a long-serving Arizona senator -- Palin responded: "And without McCain, I mean Barack Obama had 150 days in the U.S. Senate where he was able to vote quite often present, not have to make decisions, being one of many, not having to manage. His executive position now in the White House is as, whether he likes it or not, a manager. He has to make tough decisions. He has to be willing to fire people, though you don't make any friends when you fire people, and I know that first-hand because I've had to do that. And you have to make tough decisions, and not dither on issues. You have to make quick decisions in many respects, and I think that President Obama, with all due respect, his lack of experience is really made manifest in the way that decisions are made in the White House today." Palin's answer offers a lot to chew on, but we'll leave aside the larger question of whether she's more qualified to be president than the incumbent. Instead, we'll stick to the narrower claim that Obama often voted "present" in the U.S. Senate. We should point out that Palin's phrasing in this sentence is a bit unclear. Does she mean that Obama spent only 150 days in the U.S. Senate -- an argument that dovetails not just with the 2008 argument that Obama was young and inexperienced but with the (accurate) argument that he missed a lot of votes while running for president? If that's what she meant, she is incorrect. There are no statistics on day-by-day attendance for senators, but we approximated the bare minimum number of days that Obama was in the chamber by counting the number of days that he cast a vote. (In the Senate, votes cannot be cast remotely.) While it's true that Obama's absentee rate skyrocketed in the third and fourth years of his term, when he was running for president, we found that he cast votes on more than 180 separate days in 2005 and 2006, combined. And that undercounts his total days on the job, because the Senate does not necessarily vote every day that it's in session, and because we didn't count the (admittedly smaller) number of voting days he was present in 2007 and 2008. So, what about Palin's claim that Obama had 150 "present" votes in the U.S. Senate? The claim harkens back to the (again, accurate) charge that Obama frequently voted "present" when he was a state senator in Illinois. (It was actually a Democrat -- Hillary Rodham Clinton -- who gave this claim high-profile attention during the primaries.) Obama acknowledged voting "present" -- a vote similar in its effect to "abstain" -- 129 times during his eight-year state Senate tenure, according to a Boston Globe fact-check at the time. The Globe said that Obama cast about 4,000 votes as an Illinois legislator, meaning that he voted "present" in about one of every 31 votes he took. The New York Times reported that the records show at least 36 occasions in which Obama was either the only state senator to vote present or was part of a group of six or fewer to vote that way. Some of his "present" votes came on contentious issues -- abortion, juvenile justice and gun laws among them -- and critics have suggested that Obama's decision to avoid a "yes" or a "no" vote in those cases stemmed from political expediency. Other analysts have cited a more benign reason, saying that voting "present" has long been used as a way of expressing protest about the way a bill was put together, or displeasure about a specific provision contained within a bill. "You get a lot of 'present' votes from minority members to avoid the traps set by the majority," said University of Illinois at Springfield political scientist Kent Redfield. "Obama was in the minority most of the time he was in the legislature, and his present votes are slightly below the average for a member of his caucus." But this discussion of "present" votes has to do with the Illinois legislature. It has nothing to do with the U.S. Senate. We checked all of Obama's votes in the U.S. Senate and found not a single "present" vote. That's not surprising, given the way Senate procedure works. "It’s very rare for a senator to vote 'present,' " said U.S. Senate historian Donald A. Ritchie. "That’s usually only if they are somehow personally involved in something." Palin's statement is incorrect in two ways. She initially appears to suggest that Obama had only 150 days of experience in the U.S. Senate, which is inaccurate. She then says he voted present many times, which also is not correct. He never voted present in the U.S. Senate. So we find her statement False.

pomt-00900	"A lot of people who go into prison straight, and when they come out they’re gay."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/mar/04/ben-carson/ben-carson-many-prisoners-go-straight-come-out-gay/	Homosexuality is a choice, just look at the prisons, Republican neurosurgeon Ben Carson said on CNN. In a March 4 interview, the likely 2016 presidential contender said he believes that legalizing same-sex marriage is a decision that should be left to the states. He also argued that homosexuality is a choice, rather than biological. "Because a lot of people who go into prison go into prison straight -- and when they come out, they're gay. So, did something happen while they were in there? Ask yourself that question," said Carson, a former head of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital. We’ll jump to the point here: There is no conclusive evidence to support Carson’s claim that "a lot of people" make a switch from heterosexual to homosexual while in prison. Further, the medical community tends to conclude that homosexuality is not a matter of choice -- notably the American Psychological Association. "Dr. Carson's contention has a political intent but is absent of awareness of research on human sexuality," said Mark Fleisher, a social science professor at Case Western University, who studies sexuality and violence in prisons. A spokesman for Carson declined our request for comment. In the prisons Many inmates who identify as heterosexual change their sexual habits while in prison, possibly as a victim or perpetrator of abuse or due to lack of access to the opposite sex, said Christopher Hensley, a University of Tennessee at Chattanooga criminal justice professor. But a change in sexual behavior does not necessarily equate to a change in sexual orientation. Hensley recently authored a study that he said is one of the first to examine a shift in sexual orientation in prisons. He and his co-author questioned 142 prisoners at a maximum-security facility in the South about their sexual orientation. They found that of the sample, 24 men changed sexual orientation while incarcerated. Of those 24, 18 changed from straight to bisexual, three changed from bisexual to straight, and one each changed from bisexual to gay, gay to bisexual, and gay to straight. These results do not conclusively support Carson’s point, Hensley said. The sample size is too small to make any sweeping conclusions -- 142 is just about 0.001 percent of the nation’s prison population. Additionally, Hensley said his research does not support Carson’s implication that prison behavior shows that a shift in sexual orientation is a choice. Prison sex culture is not analogous to the sex culture outside of prison. "Carson is taking a simplistic view of sexuality," Hensley said. It’s possible that people go into prison unaware of their sexuality, and then once they are exposed to homosexual behavior as an inmate, they realize that they are gay or bisexual, Helen Eigenberg, who also studies prison sexuality as a professor at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, said in an interview with PolitiFact. This isn’t necessarily captured in Hensley’s research, she said. Eigenberg added that sometimes victims of sexual abuse -- in prisons that can mean gang rape, prostitution or other forms of coercion -- are sometimes confused. They might think that just because they played a role in a homosexual act, they are now gay, which is not necessarily true. "The fundamental assumption of the analogy (Carson’s) using is insane," Eigenberg told the Washington Post. We asked numerous other experts who study criminal justice and sexuality, and none agreed with Carson’s claim. Nor were they aware of modern research addressing this topic, other than Hensley’s. "There is absolutely no good evidence supporting Carson's contention, and there is good evidence against it," said J. Michael Bailey, a psychology professor at Northwestern University who studies sexual orientation. A choice? In a previous PolitiFact article, we found that, while it’s not certain what factors cause sexuality, scientists agree that personal choice is not involved. The American Psychological Association, which has 150,000 members, considers it a "settled question." Greg Herek, a psychology professor at the University of California Davis who studies sexual orientation, pointed us to a nationally representative study that shows the vast majority of gay men and women do not perceive their sexual orientation as a result of choice. People can change their behavior -- such as engaging in homosexual behavior in prison -- but that does not equate to a change in orientation, Bailey, the Northwestern researcher, told PolitiFact. He also noted that there are examples (updated with new link) of boys being surgically changed into girls at birth (in the past, for medical reasons), but when these former boys grow into women -- they are attracted to other women. "If you can't make a male attracted to men by changing him, surgically and socially, into a girl, how likely is it that prison can do that?" Bailey said. Our ruling Carson said, "A lot of people who go into prison straight, and when they come out they’re gay." There is no research that supports this point. The one study that even begins to address the topic has too small a sample size -- and too many variables -- to shed light on Carson's claim. And its author finds Carson's view "simplistic." Further, Carson used this example to prove that sexual orientation is a personal decision. Respected scientists consider it settled that homosexuality is not a matter of choice. Additionally, experts told us the sex culture in prison is not comparable to sex culture outside of prison, making it a bad analogy. We rate Carson’s claim False.

pomt-00732	"The unemployment rate among blacks in Texas is 9.5% -- far more than double white unemployment -- and wages have fallen for black workers in Texas since 2000."	true	/texas/statements/2015/apr/23/texas-organizing-project/group-black-texans-have-higher-unemployment-rate-w/	Urging the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas to choose a president who prioritizes jobs and rising wages "for all communities," a Texas group said African Americans in the state have fared poorly on both fronts. The Texas Organizing Project, which says it promotes social and economic equality for low- to moderate-income residents, joined labor unions in calling on the Fed, which has kept interest rates near zero since 2008 to spur business lending, not to raise interest rates and focus instead on full employment and higher wages, according to a March 4, 2015, news story in the Dallas Morning News. The project got our attention in a March 2015 press release with this: "Although the economy is adding jobs, the unemployment rate among blacks in Texas is 9.5% -- far more than double white unemployment -- and wages have fallen for black workers in Texas since 2000." We sought elaboration. Report offered as backup To our inquiry, a project spokesman, Daniel Barrera, pointed us by email to a March 2015 report by the Brooklyn-based Center for Popular Democracy, which says it promotes "equity, opportunity and a dynamic democracy." The report, "Wall Street, Main Street, and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard: Why African Americans Must Not Be Left Out of the Federal Reserve’s Full-Employment Mandate," presents charts with the cited figures, which the Washington, D.C.-based Economic Policy Institute based on federal wage and employment data. One chart says the 2014 Texas black unemployment rate, 9.5 percent, was more than twice the state’s white unemployment rate of 3.7 percent; the 2014 Hispanic jobless rate was 5.3 percent. Conditions may have been better in Texas than elsewhere over those years. Nationally, according to the report, black-white unemployment disparities were greatest in Wisconsin (the black jobless rate was 4.6 times the white rate), and Minnesota (the black rate was 3.7 times the white rate). Another chart in the report indicates median hourly wages of Texas whites and Hispanics increased 8 and 2.9 percent, respectively, from 2000 to 2014 while median hourly wages of black Texans decreased 0.8 percent. We wondered if blacks saw falling wages by this measure all through those years. They did not: To our inquiry, the Economic Policy Institute provided year-by-year data showing the hourly median for black Texans decreased in six years while going up in eight years. Through the period, the real median wage for Texas African Americans bottomed out at $13.61 in 2008. It crested at $15.18 in 2012. Nationally at the end of the 15-year period, median real wages of African-American workers were down even more than in Texas alone, according to the report. That is, the national median real hourly wage for African Americans in 2014 was $13.97, about 3 percent less than the comparable median of $14.41 in 2000. Also, according to the report, other states had bigger differences between the first and last years studied. Source: Report, "Wall Street, Main Street, and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard: Why African Americans Must Not Be Left Out of the Federal Reserve’s Full-Employment Mandate," Center for Popular Democracy, April 6, 2015 Source: Report, "Wall Street, Main Street, and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard: Why African Americans Must Not Be Left Out of the Federal Reserve’s Full-Employment Mandate," Center for Popular Democracy, April 6, 2015 And why? Missing from the report: Why the differences between black workers and others? When we called to ask about that, Ady Barkan, a center official, suggested multiple longstanding factors including racism and differences between blacks and whites in education levels and rates of incarceration. By email, Barkan also pointed out a July 2011 issue paper from the liberal Center for American Progress noting, among reasons, that in each of the latest U.S. recessions, blacks were most often the first employees fired and the last ones hired (once each recession was ending). We asked the Economic Policy Institute why black unemployment in Texas appeared to be running higher than white and Hispanic unemployment. Josh Bivens, director of research and policy, said by email this may be because of discrimination in the labor market and pre-labor market. And what’s the "pre-labor" market? Bivens said residential segregation can lead to blacks going to lower-quality primary and secondary schools, potentially resulting in lower levels of educational achievement and less lucrative jobs. We also sought an explanation of the cited differences from Chris King, director of the Ray Marshall Center for the Study of Human Resources at the University of Texas. By email, King said labor economists would explain higher unemployment among blacks/African Americans nationally by pointing out that African Americans tend to have lower levels of education and be employed in lower-paying occupations and industries than whites. King elaborated by pointing out Bureau of Labor Statistics data covering 2011 showing black men more likely to work in service, production, transportation and "material moving" jobs. Conversely, he wrote, black men were less likely to work in professional and managerial jobs than whites; the picture was similar, he said, for black women. (See his full reply here.) Another view Separately to our inquiry, analyst Chuck DeVore of the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation suggested real median hourly wage estimates used by the institute may deliver an incomplete picture of economic well being. "People don’t live on wages alone," DeVore said, adding that a more accurate indicator of wealth would be household income, folding in Social Security, inheritances and any other financial assistance. See more on this aspect here. Our ruling The Texas Organizing Project said: "The unemployment rate among blacks in Texas is 9.5% -- far more than double white unemployment -- and wages have fallen for black workers in Texas since 2000." Texas African Americans may not have been as bad off as residents of other states, and this claim doesn’t acknowledge wage fluctuations over the years. Regardless, evidence shows Texas blacks having a higher unemployment rate than fellow Texans and also being the lone group with lower wages in 2014 than in 2000. We rate the statement True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-05182	Says Robert Menendez is "the king of raising money from Wall Street, over a million dollars, one of the leaders in the United States Senate. I haven’t raised any Wall Street money at all."	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jun/14/joseph-kyrillos/gop-us-senate-candidate-joe-kyrillos-slams-incumbe/	When it comes to raising money from Wall Street, Republican U.S. Senate candidate Joe Kyrillos recently offered a clear distinction between him and Democratic incumbent Robert Menendez. Menendez is the "king" of such donations, while Kyrillos has received nothing of the sort, he said. "The guys in Washington – including my opponent, Senator Menendez – they govern by press release, and so, it’s laughable to talk about the Wall Street thing, because he’s the king of raising money from Wall Street, over a million dollars, one of the leaders in the United States Senate," Kyrillos, a state senator, said in a June 6 interview on NJToday. "I haven’t raised any Wall Street money at all." PolitiFact New Jersey discovered that Kyrillos needs to check his own campaign account. He’s right about Menendez being one of the leading recipients in the U.S. Senate of donations from the Securities & Investment industry, if not exactly the "king." But Kyrillos is wrong to say he hasn’t received any such donations, when records show he has collected nearly $60,000 for his current campaign. To analyze Kyrillos’ claim, we researched data available on OpenSecrets.org, a nonpartisan website tracking political donations. The website is managed by the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Responsive Politics. The latest data on the Securities & Investment industry includes figures released by the Federal Election Commission on June 4 -- two days before Kyrillos’ interview. The donations tallied on the website represent contributions of $200 or more from employees and political action committees within the industry. According to that data, Menendez has received nearly $1.4 million from the industry between 1989 and 2012. Menendez served as a congressman for 13 years before joining the Senate in 2006. That amount puts Menendez in 15th place among the nation’s 100 Senators for such donations, according to data on OpenSecrets.org. The 14 Senators with greater donations than Menendez include six Democrats, seven Republicans and one Independent. The leading recipient is former presidential candidate and U.S. Sen. John McCain (R-Arizona), who has received about $11.2 million from the Securities & Investment industry. In a statement, Menendez’s campaign manager, Michael Soliman, pointed to the senator’s "long-standing record of championing common sense reforms that have sided with consumers over banks." "This silly partisan gotcha attack is absurd - by Joe Kyrlllos’s own standard John McCain, Mark Kirk, Scott Brown and Mitch McConnell - four Republican senator's - are the real Kings of Raising Money from Wall Street," Soliman added, referring to other senators who have raised more money from the industry than Menendez. As for Kyrillos, he has received his share of such donations as well. According to OpenSecrets.org, Kyrillos has received nearly $60,000 from the Securities & Investment industry for his current campaign. Chapin Fay, Kyrillos’ campaign manager, responded to our findings in a statement: "You seem to be on a search to find anyway to find our statements not accurate and are missing the main point Senator Kyrillos made—Bob Menendez was cited as a top recipient of Wall Street money and Joe Kyrillos was not." Our ruling As the battle heats up for a U.S. Senate seat, Kyrillos claimed Menendez is "the king of raising money from Wall Street, over a million dollars, one of the leaders in the United States Senate. I haven’t raised any Wall Street money at all." Data on OpenSecrets.org shows that Menendez has received nearly $1.4 million from the Securities & Investment industry, putting him in 15th place among sitting Senators for such donations. That ranking means Menendez is one of the leading recipients, but it’s an exaggeration to call him "the king of raising money from Wall Street." Also, Kyrillos is wrong about his own fundraising, because he’s received nearly $60,000 from the industry for his current campaign, according to OpenSecrets.org. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-06936	"The Florida Legislature has not filed a lawsuit to fight Amendments 5 and 6."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2011/jul/20/alan-hays/senators-says-legislature-didnt-file-lawsuit-fight/	How the Legislature decides to redraw state and congressional legislative districts in 2012 will be one of the bigger political stories of the coming year. So at PolitiFact Florida, we think it's important to stay on top of the claims coming out of the redistricting discussion. Florida Sen. Alan Hays, an Umatilla Republican, made several claims that we thought worth checking to clarify that debate. They all come from the same exchange with a voter during a July 13, 2011 public hearing at The Villages, a mainly conservative retirement community in Central Florida. "Some of you people had voted to tax or to spend our taxes against the amendments that were passed by 63 percent of the vote," the voter said to a group of legislators, including Hays. "I wonder if you, Sen. Hays, since I'm in your district, did you vote?" "Did I vote for what?" Hays asked. "....These taxes being paid for the suit against the amendments?" the man asked. The amendments the man was referring to were Amendments 5 and 6, which were approved by voters in 2010. The amendments were sold by supporters as a way to keep the politics out of redrawing legislative boundaries. But two of Florida's minority members of Congress -- Democrat Corrine Brown and Republican Mario Diaz-Balart -- are seeking to overturn Amendment 6 (which relates to congressional redistricting) arguing that the amendment will negatively affect minority representation. "No I did not vote to spend money to fight that lawsuit," Hays said later in response to the man. "The disappointing part of this whole thing, folks, is the misinformation that is out there. The Florida Legislature has not filed a lawsuit to fight Amendments 5 and 6. The Amendment 6 lawsuit was filed by one Republican congressman and one Democratic congresswoman. The Florida House chose to go, and what's the term? An intervenor? ... in seeking clarification. The Florida House intervened. But your tax dollars are not being used to sue you, the people who voted the 63 percent. Believe me. I don't know where you got your information but it's incorrect. So no I did not vote to waste that money." In one item, we checked Hays' assertion that he "did not vote to spend money to fight that lawsuit." In another, we checked Hays' statement that tax dollars are not being used to fight the lawsuit. In this fact-check, we're seeing if Hays is right to say that "the Florida Legislature has not filed a lawsuit to fight Amendments 5 and 6." As we noted, the amendments were crafted as a way to eliminate gerrymandering and keep elected officials from drawing districts to their benefit. Amendment 5 deals with state legislative districts, and Amendment 6 covers congressional districts. The amendments were approved by the required 60 percent of voters during the Nov. 2, 2010, election. Here are their ballot summaries: Amendment 5 — Legislative districts or districting plans may not be drawn to favor or disfavor an incumbent or political party. Districts shall not be drawn to deny racial or language minorities the equal opportunity to participate in the political process and elect representatives of their choice. Districts must be contiguous. Unless otherwise required, districts must be compact, as equal in population as feasible, and where feasible must make use of existing city, county and geographical boundaries. Amendment 6 — Congressional districts or districting plans may not be drawn to favor or disfavor an incumbent or political party. Districts shall not be drawn to deny racial or language minorities the equal opportunity to participate in the political process and elect representatives of their choice. Districts must be contiguous. Unless otherwise required, districts must be compact, as equal in population as feasible, and where feasible must make use of existing city, county and geographical boundaries. The day after Florida voters passed both amendments, Brown and Diaz-Balart filed a lawsuit challenging Amendment 6. Brown, who is black and Diaz-Balart who is Hispanic, argued that Amendment 6 would reverse efforts to help minorities -- such as themselves -- get elected to Congress. The lawsuit did not challenge Amendment 5 because that dealt only with seats in the state Legislature while Amendment 6 relates to congressional boundaries. Records in U.S. District Court show that on Jan. 14, 2011, the Florida House, represented by the GrayRobinson law firm, filed an unopposed motion to intervene as a plaintiff. On the same day, the House filed a complaint asking that Amendment 6 be declared unconstitutional. On March 17, the court granted the House's motion to become an intervenor. The case is still pending in U.S. District Court. The Senate has not joined the lawsuit, and Senate President Mike Haridopolos' Chief of Staff Craig Meyer told us July 15 the Senate has no intention of trying to join the lawsuit. "The voters spoke; we want to respect the voters," Haridopolos said in a Florida Times-Union article in February. In other words, Brown and Diaz-Balart were the original plaintiffs and the Florida House was added on as an additional "plaintiff intervenor" as written on court documents. The Senate isn't a party. What's important for this fact-check is to know that a plaintiff intervenor is an actual plaintiff. Just like an original plaintiff, in its role as the plaintiff intervenor the Florida House has lawyers and files motions. The two members of Congress and the Florida House are now on the same side of the legal fight in court against the defendant, the Florida Secretary of State (the state agency is the defendant because it is the agency implementing the amendments). "Because Amendment 6 was enacted wholly outside of the state legislative process and imposes requirements that go beyond simply regulating the 'manner' of congressional elections the Court should declare that it is invalid and grant judgment in plaintiffs' favor," attorneys for the Brown, Diaz-Balart and the Florida House wrote in a April 25 court motion. We sent Hays' claim to a few law professors in Florida to ask if Hays was right to state that the Legislature didn't file a lawsuit to fight the amendments. We also asked if his characterization of being an intervenor in this instance was simply seeking "clarification." We interviewed by e-mail Bob Jarvis, at Nova Southeastern University; Michael Froomkin, at the University of Miami and Joe Little, at the University of Florida. Hays scores points here in a purely technical way because the House wasn't the original filer of the lawsuit and technically intervening isn't the same as being the original filer. But Hays' comments are disingenuous, Jarvis said. "The lawsuit was not filed by the Legislature, but the Legislature is spending taxpayer dollars on a court fight whose goal is to have the amendments declared invalid. ... The plaintiff controls the lawsuit; the intervenor comes along for the ride and has much less say in how the case proceeds. So tactically, you usually want to be the plaintiff." Here, it does not make much difference, because the plaintiff and the intervenor both want the amendment declared unconstitutional, Jarvis wrote. Hays' use of the word "clarification" is also misleading, Jarvis said, because "there is nothing for the court to clarify with respect to the amendments -- they either are constitutional or they are not. A clarification would involve, for example, a question regarding how the amendments are to be operationally implemented." Little, who emphasized that he hadn't looked at the court filings and was speaking in general, wrote that while the difference between filing a lawsuit and intervening on the side of the plaintiff is a factual distinction, "On the merits the distinction would be seen by most people as 'without a difference.'" In most cases the difference between the original filer and the intervenor is "utterly technical" once the intervenor is allowed to join, Froomkin wrote. "For example, if the original plaintiff were to pull out, the intervenor would have a right to continue the suit. When they are both in, both have the same rights as each other." We asked Hays about his claims during an interview July 15. He said he could have been clearer by saying the Senate was not party to the lawsuit, instead of the Legislature. "Did I speak inaccurately? Perhaps I did. If we are going to split the hair a part of the Legislature did join the lawsuit -- they didn't file the lawsuit." Hays also disagreed with the suggestion that the House is "suing" the people of Florida. "If the House was suing the people of Florida, No. 1 the House would have been one of the initiators of the thing. Their purpose would have been to overturn the thing." Hays said he has heard the House chose to join the lawsuit "for clarification to determine whether or not that amendment in the Florida Constitution puts us in conflict with the U.S. Constitution." He said the goal of the two members of Congress is to overturn Amendment 6. If Hays had said the "Florida Senate has not filed a lawsuit against Amendments 5 and 6" that would be a true statement -- the Senate has not joined the lawsuit against Amendment 6 and has no plans to do so. And the lawsuit is about Amendment 6 -- not Amendment 5. But that's not what Hays said -- he said the Legislature has not filed a lawsuit. While that's true on a technical level -- the two members of Congress filed the lawsuit -- the House did join as a plaintiff. Hays later explained that the House joined as an intervenor "seeking clarification" but the House is seeking more than clarification -- the House has filed a motion asking that Amendment 6 be declared unconstitutional. We rate this claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-09998	"Secretary Geithner has left the option on the table" of abandoning the dollar for a multinational currency.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/apr/01/michele-bachmann/defending-dollar-bachmann-distorts-geithners-comme/	Rep. Michele Bachmann has been uncommonly strident lately in her opposition to the Democrats running Congress and the Obama administration. Bachmann, a Minnesota Republican who is a tax lawyer, considers herself a "foreign correspondent on enemy lines" in Washington, D.C. She also called for an "orderly revolution" against the Democrats on a recent radio show. One source of her concern, Bachmann has said repeatedly, is that she fears the Obama administration wants to do away with the dollar. She introduced a constitutional amendment on March 25 that would prohibit that. Thirty-one Republicans have co-sponsored it. In a news release announcing the measure, Bachmann claimed Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner had said he was open to the idea of dropping the dollar. "Yesterday, during a Financial Services Committee hearing, I asked Secretary Geithner if he would denounce efforts to move towards a global currency and he answered unequivocally that he would," Bachmann said in the March 25, 2009 news release . "And President Obama gave the nation the same assurances. But just a day later, Secretary Geithner has left the option on the table. I want to know which it is." Bachmann's allegation that Geithner "left the option on the table" is based on comments he made at a question-and-answer session that day at the Council on Foreign Relations. Here's the relevant exchange: "Wonder if you could comment on two related things," a questioner said to Geithner. "One, the Chinese government proposal about a global currency; and about the IMF regulations..." "On the first question, I haven't read the (Chinese central bank) governor's proposal," Geithner said. "He's a remarkably — a very thoughtful, very careful, distinguished central banker. Generally find him sensible on every issue." It might have sounded to those who don't follow finance that Geithner declined to dismiss the idea of replacing the dollar with a multinational currency. But those who do follow finance would know the Chinese proposal had nothing to do with replacing the U.S. currency. Rather, it was to replace the dollar as the international reserve currency. An Associated Press Q-and-A about the Chinese proposal published a day before Bachmann's news release explained the difference: "Q: Does China want to get rid of the dollar and other currencies?" it says. "A: No, Americans wouldn't be expected to give up the dollar, nor would China give up its yuan, for that matter. The idea is to create an international currency that China and other countries could use to hold trillions of dollars in reserves." Chinese officials have argued that creating a new global currency for international reserves would protect them from the danger of inflation of the dollar, which would lower the value of their reserves. In any event, for Geithner to entertain the Chinese idea (which he later firmly rejected) was decidedly not to consider pulling the greenback off the street in favor of some one-world currency. Yet that is clearly how Bachmann portrayed Geithner's remarks. Bachmann's spokeswoman, Debee Keller, said, "We all recognize the difference between the global reserve currency and the actual currency we use here in the U.S." She said Bachmann was trying to defend the dollar's status in both regards. But in her news release and in public comments, Bachmann continually distorted the issue, suggesting that Geithner expressed openness to replacing the dollar as the U.S. currency. For example, her news release was titled: "Bachmann Demands Truth: Will Obama Administration Abandon Dollar for a Multi-National Currency?" It said her resolution would "bar the dollar from being replaced by any foreign currency." And her proposed constitutional amendment makes no mention of an international reserve currency — rather it would forbid the president from "entering into a treaty or other international agreement that would provide for the United States to adopt as legal tender in the United States a currency issued by an entity other than the United States." Bachmann continued to confuse the issue the next day on Hannity's America: "I'm very concerned about the international moves they're making," she said, referring to the Obama administration. "Particularly the question that there was about moving the United States off of the dollar and onto a global currency, like Russia and China are calling for." Again, Russia and China were not calling for "moving the United States off the dollar." A few days later, on the Glenn Beck Program, Bachmann made comments that indicated more understanding of the subtlety of the issue. Instead of railing against replacing the dollar, she referred to the prospect of the International Monetary Fund "taking the dollar off as the medium of exchange." But never during that appearance did she correct Beck's introduction, in which he had said Geithner "can't make up his mind whether or not he supports the global currency to replace the U.S. dollar or leave the U.S. dollar. The next guest (Bachmann) adamantly opposes a global currency and is proposing legislation now that would prohibit the United States from recognizing any other currency besides the greenback." So Bachmann left Beck's viewers with the impression that Geithner was open to abandoning the dollar. This claim, which Bachmann repeated in several forums over several days, including in a news release that remains on her Web site, is just wrong. That earns a False on the Truth-O-Meter.

pomt-14327	"Since 1900, six (U.S. Supreme Court) justices have been confirmed during election years, including Justice Anthony Kennedy, who was confirmed in the final year of the Reagan Administration."	true	/virginia/statements/2016/mar/29/mark-herring/herring-correct-about-supreme-court-justices-confi/	Virginia Attorney General Mark R. Herring dismisses the notion that the U.S. Senate shouldn’t fill the Supreme Court vacancy before voters head to the polls in November. "Since 1900, six (U.S. Supreme Court) justices have been confirmed during election years, including Justice Anthony Kennedy, who was confirmed in the final year of the Reagan Administration," Herring and fellow Democratic attorneys general wrote in a March 10 letter to U.S. Senate leaders. Herring’s letter was sent less than a week before President Barack Obama nominated U.S. Appeals Court Judge Merrick Garland to succeed Justice Antonin Scalia, who died Feb. 13. We recently looked at another Herring claim that every nominee since 1875 had received a confirmation hearing, a statement we rated Mostly False. Here, we’re checking to see whether the attorney general was closer to the mark when he said there have been six justices confirmed during presidential election years since the start of the 20th century. Michael Kelly, his spokesman, pointed us to several sources to back Herring’s statement, including a nearly identical claim on the White House website. He also pointed us to several other sources, including an article in The New York Times about presidential election year confirmations and the U.S. Senate’s historic listing of all Supreme Court vacancies. We have some familiarity with the history of presidential election year confirmations going back to 1940, because we checked a statement by Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-6th, who claimed that was the last time the Senate confirmed a Supreme Court nominee during a presidential election year. We rated that claim Half True. Our colleagues at PolitiFact have looked at statements examining presidential year confirmations going back even further, to the early 1900s, which hews more closely to Herring’s claim. We examined the record to see if Herring was correct. The first Supreme Court confirmation in a presidential election year in the 20th century occurred in 1912. President William Howard Taft nominated Mahlon Pitney in February that year, and the Senate confirmed him the following month. In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson nominated Louis Brandeis and John Clarke to the high court, and both were confirmed that year. In 1932, President Herbert Hoover nominated Benjamin Cardozo to high court, and the Senate confirmed him within two weeks. In 1940, President Franklin D. Roosevelt nominated Frank Murphy to the court; the overwhelmingly Democratic-led Senate approved the choice less than two weeks later. After Murphy’s elevation to the court, it would be nearly five decades before there was another justice confirmed in an election year. Anthony Kennedy, the justice Herring specifically cited in his letter, was confirmed in a 97-0 vote in the Democratically controlled Senate on Feb. 3, 1988. That was the final full year of President Ronald Reagan’s administration. Republicans argue that Kennedy’s case isn’t comparable to the current Supreme Court vacancy, because Kennedy filled a seat that opened six months before the 1988 election year. Reagan initially nominated Robert Bork to fill the vacancy left by retiring Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr., but the Senate rejected him in a vote that October. Reagan then announced he would nominate Douglas Ginsburg. But Ginsburg’s nomination was withdrawn after he acknowledged smoking marijuana as a college student and early in his teaching career. Finally, Reagan nominated Kennedy in November 1987. Regardless of that debate, Kennedy’s elevation to the court indeed did occur during an election year. We should note there have been some false starts in getting high court nominees through the Senate during a presidential election year. President Lyndon B. Johnson tried to elevate Justice Abe Fortas to chief justice and nominated Homer Thornberry to take Fortas’ place on the bench in 1968. But both nominations fizzled after the Senate filibustered the Fortas nomination. Our ruling Herring said there have been six presidential election year confirmations for Supreme Court seats going back to 1900. There indeed were six justices confirmed during presidential election years in that time frame. We rate his claim True.

pomt-09659	"If you want to talk firsts for Bush, this was the first time in American history that a president took us into a war and cut taxes."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/30/paul-krugman/krugman-says-bush-was-first-president-lead-country/	With President Barack Obama scheduled to make a speech on Dec. 1 on how the United States will proceed with the war in Afghanistan, war spending was the topic du jour on the Sunday political talk shows. Some Democratic officials have even talked of a war surtax to pay for the expense of additional troops. Depending on how many more troops Obama decides to send, the cost could top $30 billion. "This is a lot of money," liberal New York Times columnist Paul Krugman said on ABC's This Week with George Stephanopoulos on Nov. 29, 2009. "And the point is, we should have been paying for these wars to begin with, right from the beginning. I mean, this was, if you want to talk firsts for Bush, this was the first time in American history that a president took us into a war and cut taxes." As the talk about the price tag for the war in Afghanistan heats up, we thought it would be worthwhile to take a look at Krugman's claim about Bush being the first to cut taxes after leading the country into war, and to add some context. Generally, we found, taxes and wars have followed a fairly predictable pattern: Taxes rise during wartime and then come back down in the years afterward. We'll start with the Civil War. Congress enacted various income and excise taxes to meet the rising cost of the war, most of which were repealed in the years after the war. During World War I, the 1916 Revenue Act and the War Revenue Act of 1917 increased tax revenue from $761 million in 1916 to $3.6 billion in 1918. After the war, in the 1920s, Congress cut taxes five times. The same was true during World War II. Tax increases over several years raised revenues from $8.7 billion in 1941 to $45.2 billion in 1945. Again, tax cuts followed the war. It's worth noting, however, that during all of those wars, the war expenses were much larger than today, relative to the size of the economy. Congress hasn't formally declared war since then, but we think it's fair to consider the wars in Korea, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf and Iraq. However, we have decided not to include the armed conflicts in Grenada in 1983 and Panama in 1989 due to their much smaller cost, length and scope. So those are the wars. But what about major tax cuts? That's a smaller and somewhat more subjective list. Some of the most notable tax cuts have come during peacetime, such as the Reagan tax cut that took effect over the years 1982-84, and the smaller capital gains tax cuts under Carter and Clinton. The one notable exception is the Kennedy tax cuts, which took effect in 1964. The conflict in Vietnam stretched from 1959 to 1975, but when the Kennedy tax cuts were implemented, the Vietnam War did not have much of an impact on the U.S. budget. Within 18 months, when the tax cuts were in full bloom, the United States was spending plenty in Vietnam. The tax rates were phasing down just as our commitment in Vietnam was ramping up, said William Ahern of the Tax Foundation. "That would maybe be a counter example (to Krugman)," he said. But many argue the Kennedy tax cuts shouldn't count in Krugman's example because they came at a time when the United States did not anticipate the escalation of the war that followed. "The Kennedy tax cuts were proposed, and then adopted by Congress, before the Vietnam war was a big expenditure item," said Gary Burtless, senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution. "Vietnam initially did not require much in the way of additional outlays; it was not like either World War II or the Korean War, which started out with a huge runup in military spending. It was not until 1968 that the Johnson administration proposed the surtax to help pay for the Vietnam War. ... Still, the Vietnam era surtax went into effect within five years of major spending on that war. We are now more than eight years into the 'war on terrorism,' and we’ve had only tax reductions; no tax hikes." We think Krugman is on firm ground. Aside from the Kennedy tax cuts during the Vietnam War, which were adopted before Vietnam became such a major fiscal issue, taxes have gone up during war. "Traditionally countries raise taxes to pay for wars, then cut taxes by a portion of the amount raised once peace descends," agreed J.D. Foster, senior fellow in the economics of fiscal policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation. But Foster noted two caveats. One, the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 came during a jobless recovery period after a recession. And the economic stimulus package championed by Obama includes $282 billion in tax cuts over two years -- also in the midst of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. "Curious though," Foster said, "whether Krugman is arguing we should have raised taxes when the economy was experiencing a jobless recovery (and by implication arguing we should raise taxes now), or whether he is trying to say Obama is just like Bush since if Bush was the first to do this, then Obama was the second." Krugman has not advocated a tax increase to deal with the war in Afghanistan. And we think Krugman also has some wiggle room on that second point, because he said Bush was the first president who "took us into a war" and cut taxes. Both wars were inherited by Obama. Again, there are many different political and economic realities now than there were when taxes generally rose during wars, but Krugman is still mostly right. We dock him some points, though, because the Kennedy tax cuts technically came during the Vietnam War and rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-11935	A Homeland Security study "showed 120 murders took place that could have been prevented had communities been working with ICE and Homeland Security."	false	/georgia/statements/2017/oct/12/casey-cagle/georgia-lt-gov-casey-cagle-misleads-claim-about-ho/	Georgia Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle said his state won’t tolerate sanctuary cities and cited as backup a federal report, claiming it found that more than 100 murders could have been prevented if communities worked with immigration officers. "Sanctuary city" is a term commonly used for a jurisdiction that limits its cooperation with immigration authorities. Federal officials send requests to local jails asking them to hold individuals scheduled for release so that immigration officers can pick them up. The extent of cooperation and scope of the policies implemented vary by jurisdiction. Cagle, who is running for governor, told a local news station that the City of Decatur may be in violation of a state law prohibiting sanctuary cities. "How are they in direct violation?" WSB-TV’s Craig Lucie asked Cagle. (Decatur said it complies with state law and called the sanctuary city label a misunderstanding.) "Well, they are not cooperating with (U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement), and the important feature of this is that criminal illegal aliens, it was demonstrated with a Homeland Security study, that showed 120 murders took place that could have been prevented had communities been working with ICE and Homeland Security," Cagle said Oct. 9. President Donald Trump has claimed that sanctuary cities attract criminals and blamed their policies for the killings of Americans by immigrants in the country illegally. Given the national debate about sanctuary cities, we wondered if Cagle was right that the Department of Homeland Security had determined that 120 murders might not have happened if communities cooperated with immigration authorities. We found that DHS has not done a study on this issue. Cagle’s office pointed us to a 2015 letter from the Senate Judiciary Committee, which said that according to ICE data, "up to 121 homicides in the U.S. could have been avoided" between fiscal years 2010 and 2014 if ICE had deported criminal immigrants instead of releasing them back into the United States. But that letter is not about sanctuary cities’ lack of cooperation with ICE. DHS, Cagle’s response David Lapan, spokesman for DHS, told PolitiFact that neither DHS or ICE had published a report showing that murders could have been prevented in communities if they complied with immigration authorities. "However, there are instances where criminal aliens who were released from jails -- without allowing ICE to take custody -- who then went on to commit additional crimes, including murder," Lapan said. But information provided by Cagle’s office did not support the claim that 120 murders took place due to sanctuary city policies. A June 12, 2015, letter from Sen. Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and then Sen. Jeff Sessions, who chaired the Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest, specified that 121 criminal immigrants were charged with homicide after their release from ICE custody from fiscal years 2010 and 2014. Of the 121 individuals released by ICE: • 33 were released on a bond set by the Justice Department’s Executive Office of Immigration Review; • 24 were released because a 2001 Supreme Court case, Zadvydas vs. Davis, prevents the indefinite detention of immigrants who can’t be deported (some countries won’t take back their nationals ordered removed); • 64 were released per ICE’s discretion. The letter does not say that the homicides for which the 121 individuals were charged could have been prevented if communities or sanctuary cities had cooperated with ICE. It centered on ICE’s release of the immigrants from their custody. The senators asked DHS, the State Department and the Attorney General to identify the jurisdictions to which the 121 criminal immigrants were released. A June 16, 2015, letter sent to ICE’s assistant secretary doesn’t cite a specific number of homicides that could have been avoided, but more broadly said 121 criminals who were not deported were charged with homicides after their release from ICE custody between fiscal years 2010 and 2014. The Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that favors low immigration levels, reviewed data related to the 121 criminal immigrants. "This tally does not include aliens who were released by sanctuary jurisdictions, nor those aliens that were released by local law enforcement agencies after ICE declined to take them into custody due to Obama administration prioritization policies. This list includes only those aliens that ICE arrested and then released," the center reported in March 2016. Cagle’s overarching message is that homicides could have been prevented if criminal immigrants were deported, his office said. "The safety and security of every Georgian has been, and always will be, the top priority of Lt. Gov. Cagle," said Bo Butler, Cagle’s chief of staff. "The point in referencing this shocking number of murders is that Homeland Security concluded at least 121 homicides were committed by convicted criminal illegal aliens. Had deportation occurred following the previous convictions, this loss of life could have been prevented." Our ruling Cagle said that a Homeland Security study "showed 120 murders took place that could have been prevented had communities been working with ICE and Homeland Security." Many elements of this statement are wrong. DHS said it had not published such a report. Cagle’s office actually referred to a 2015 letter from the Senate Judiciary Committee, citing ICE data, that said up to 121 homicides could have been avoided if ICE had deported criminal immigrants. While the letter started off saying 121 homicides were preventable, the document focuses on 121 being the number of criminal immigrants who were charged with homicide after being released by ICE. Most importantly, while homicides were committed, the letter does not claim they could have been avoided had sanctuary policies not been in place. Cagle’s statement is not accurate. We rate it False.

pomt-05023	Funding the federal health care law without a tax hike will "require the state to cut nearly a quarter of its annual budget."	false	/georgia/statements/2012/jul/16/brian-robinson/deal-spokesman-slips-health-care-impact-georgia/	The recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the federal health care law had many Georgians attempting to figure out what it meant for the state. Brian Robinson, the communications director for Gov. Nathan Deal, a Republican, offered some insight in a front-page article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that had a few readers and organizations questioning its accuracy. A couple of them contacted PolitiFact Georgia to get some answers. State officials have said the law will result in at least 620,000 additional Georgians being eligible for its Medicaid program, which they estimate will cost about $4.5 billion over 10 years. Georgia was one of about two dozen states to join the lawsuit against the health care law that was reviewed by the Supreme Court. "To pay for the expansion without tax increases would require the state to cut nearly a quarter of its annual budget," Robinson said. "And that’s after we’ve shaved off billions in state spending since the beginning of the Great Recession." Cutting a quarter of the state budget? That could be catastrophic. The Georgia Budget & Policy Institute, which has concluded the health care law will save Georgia money, quickly disputed Robinson’s math in a news release. The institute, which frequently takes moderate to liberal positions on many Georgia fiscal issues, also pressed the state to provide information detailing how it calculated the $4.5 billion estimate on state finances. "It makes the issue sound bigger than it is," Tim Sweeney, the institute’s director of health policy, said of Robinson’s claim in a telephone interview. "We want to make sure it’s out there that it’s not true." The Georgia General Assembly adopted a $19.3 billion budget for the fiscal year that began July 1. The health care law expands Medicaid eligibility in 2014 to nearly all Americans under 65 with incomes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level. An additional 5 percent is disregarded when determining income eligibility, which effectively raises the threshold to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. The 2012 federal poverty level for a family of four in Georgia is $23,050. The number of Georgia enrollees is projected to rise from 1.6 million to nearly 2.3 million as a result of the the law. The law provides that the federal government will pay 100 percent of the costs of covering these individuals through 2016. In the following years, the federal payment level gradually decreases, to a minimum of 90 percent. The impact on state government in Fiscal Year 2015 is expected to be about $225 million, according to the state Department of Community Health. The annual impact of the health care law on Georgia’s Medicaid program rises by about $100 million a year between fiscal years 2016 and 2022, the state estimates. Georgia’s fiscal year begins July 1 and ends June 30. As we noted, the state budget is $19.3 billion. If the state had to cut a quarter of its current budget, that figure would be about $4.825 billion. But the health care law’s impact on Medicaid spending in Georgia is projected to stretch over 10 years, not one year. The Fiscal Year 2014 impact on Medicaid spending is estimated to be about $80 million, which would be about 2 percent of the state budget if the budget remains at its current levels. Robinson, after an initial refusal to discuss the matter, admitted he erred. "What I said isn’t accurate," he told us. "I messed up. I was correctly quoted by the reporter." Robinson said his underlying point was that the health care law would result in potentially a major financial commitment from the state for Medicaid payments. "The way I said it made it sound like we’re spending $4.5 billion more per year. That’s not true," Robinson wrote us via email. "I SHOULD have said ‘Over 10 years, the new mandated spending will total a quarter of what the state spends on ALL services in its annual budget." Indeed. If he had said the potential impact of the health care law on Medicaid is equivalent to a quarter of the state’s budget, Robinson would have earned a True rating. But our rating of his actual statement as it appeared in the newspaper: False.	None	Brian Robinson	None	None	None	2012-07-16T06:00:00	2012-07-08	['None']
pomt-11001	Says Bernie Sanders was indifferent to Russia's annexation of Crimea because he felt "they have a lot of Russians anyway."	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/jul/11/danielle-pletka/was-bernie-sanders-fine-russian-annexation-crimea-/	Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea is poised to resurface as President Donald Trump prepares for his first summit with Russia’s Vladimir Putin. Virtually the entire global community, including President Barack Obama’s administration, refused to recognize the annexation, which was the first such takeover in Europe since the end of the Cold War. But given Trump’s friendliness to Putin, some foreign policy specialists are wondering whether the president might soon change the U.S. position on the annexation of territory that belonged to Ukraine. During the July 8 edition of NBC’s Meet the Press, Danielle Pletka, the senior vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, equated the Russia-friendly comments of Trump with the stance of the 2016 Democratic presidential runner-up, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. "The Crimea thing highlights something much more important, which is this awful meeting of sort of the Bernie bros and the Trump people on this question of eating away at other country's sovereignty," Pletka said. "You know, ‘Oh no, that's fine, what do we care? Crimea, they've got a lot of Russians anyway.’ Bernie Sanders took that position, President Trump takes that position. I don't understand why it is that the center-right and the center-left are not more forceful on this issue." There’s a problem with this assertion: Sanders has consistently opposed the Russian annexation of Crimea. Here are some of his comments (with bold emphasis by us): • On March 17, 2014, Sanders wrote in an official statement, "The entire world has got to stand up to Putin. We've got to deal with sanctions." • On Feb. 4, 2016, during an MSNBC Democratic primary debate, Sanders said, "I worry about Putin and his military adventurism in the Crimea and the Ukraine." (Sanders did go on to say that he ranked the "isolated" nation of North Korea as the most serious national security threat to the United States, above Russia, without minimizing Russia’s threats.) • Feb. 11, 2016, during a PBS Democratic primary debate, Sanders said, "Right now, we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia. But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO — correctly, I believe — are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action. I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him. But bottom line is: The president is right. We have to put more money. We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression." When we contacted Sanders’ office, they said the senator stands by the positions in these quotes. The closest potential evidence suggesting that Sanders was copacetic with the annexation of Crimea was his vote against legislation that would tighten sanctions on Russia. The bill, called the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, passed with only three nay votes in the House and two in the Senate, including Sanders, before it was signed by Trump in August 2017. However, Sanders made clear that his objection to the bill had to do with its policies toward Iran, not the sanctions on Russia. In June 15, 2017, statement, Sanders said, "I am strongly supportive of the sanctions on Russia included in this bill. It is unacceptable for Russia to interfere in our elections here in the United States, or anywhere around the world. There must be consequences for such actions." However, Sanders continued that on Iran, "these new sanctions could endanger the very important nuclear agreement that was signed between the United States, its partners and Iran in 2015." (Trump subsequently dropped United States support for the Iran nuclear agreement.) Russia specialists we contacted agreed that Sanders has been consistent in opposing the annexation of Crimea. "I don’t think there is evidence that Sanders or his supporters were ever in support of Russian annexation of Crimea," said Yoshiko Herrera, a University of Wisconsin-Madison political scientist. "Both center-left and center-right supported sanctions and punishment of Russia over Crimea annexation." Dan Nexon, an associate professor of government and foreign service at Georgetown University, agreed. "The Sanders campaign considered the annexation of Crimea illegal and illegitimate," said Dan Nexon, an associate professor of government and foreign service at Georgetown University. "He did have a more calibrated position that sought to balance, on the one hand, deterrence and pressure with, on the other hand, avoiding unnecessary escalation. But it was never that he said, ‘That’s fine. What do we care?’" Pletka told PunditFact that she may have conflated some past research she had done on the issue, inaccurately attributing the views of some left-wing Democrats to Sanders, who did not share them. Our ruling Pletka said Sanders was indifferent to Russia's annexation of Crimea because he felt "they have a lot of Russians anyway." We found no evidence to support that assertion. To the contrary, we found that Sanders has consistently criticized the annexation since it occurred and supported measures to punish Russia. We rate the statement False.

pomt-07006	Newt Gingrich’s presidential campaign has "exactly the same" challenges as Ronald Reagan’s successful 1980 bid.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2011/jul/08/newt-gingrich/gingrich-says-campaign-problems-exactly-same-reaga/	Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich is comparing his struggles to those of President Ronald Reagan so often it’s turning into a habit. The former West Georgia College history professor said June 22, during a speech at the Atlanta Press Club, that on the day of the 1980 New Hampshire primary, "the top 13 people of Ronald Reagan’s staff quit." We ruled his claim Mostly True. Gingrich recycled the historical tidbit that same day before a crowd near Baltimore and to Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly, both times in slightly different ways that hewed close to the truth. But the Truth-O-Meter's dial began to spin when it got word of what Gingrich said June 27 on Fox News’ "Your World With Neil Cavuto." Cavuto asked Gingrich how he will fight the perception his campaign is "rudderless" and assure voters that he can get his campaign on track. "Well, first of all, by not being distracted, but focusing on substance and talking about the solutions we need as a country, and second by reminding people that Ronald Reagan had exactly the same challenges in 1980 -- John McCain had exactly the same challenges in 2007," Gingrich said. Ronald Reagan had "exactly the same" challenges in 1980 as Newt Gingrich does? We rated his earlier statement Mostly True because on balance, Gingrich’s claim squared with history. At about 2 p.m. Feb. 26, 1980, the day of the New Hampshire primary, Reagan met with campaign manager John Sears and two other top staffers in his hotel suite. Reagan and others blamed Sears for losing the Iowa caucuses. Reagan handed Sears a news release that announced the campaign’s new manager was future Central Intelligence Agency head William Casey. It said Sears had resigned to return to his law practice. Sears got the message and left, as did staffers loyal to him. Gingrich’s memory wasn’t perfect. But yes, many of Reagan’s top aides left the campaign on the day of his blowout victory in New Hampshire. Staffers left Gingrich’s campaign under very different circumstances. News accounts said Gingrich’s high command rebelled after disagreements on the direction of the campaign. The Associated Press, which broke the story, described the dissent as a "rebellion." On-the-record accounts indicate Gingrich did not orchestrate these departures as Reagan did in 1980. Staffers left of their own accord because they disagreed with the direction of the campaign. The departures started May 31, when Will Rogers, Gingrich’s Iowa political director, resigned. Rogers told The Des Moines Register that he thought Gingrich wasn’t campaigning or fundraising hard enough. Gingrich’s departure for a luxury vacation in the Greek isles was the last straw. Former staffers Rick Tyler, Gingrich’s longtime spokesman, and the campaign’s Iowa director Craig Schoenfield both told The Boston Globe after they left that they and others resigned after a series of meetings involving top-level campaign aides. Schoenfeld told Politico that staffers couldn’t convince Gingrich to run a more labor-intensive campaign. "To be successful in Iowa you need to be here [and] taking a look at the way the schedule was, he’s not scheduled to be here in June at all and he’s got very few appearances in July," Scoenfeld said. "You need to make sure that you give yourself a chance to be successful." Tyler told the National Journal that staffers made up their minds to resign June 9, the day the news broke. There are other glaring differences between the Gingrich and Reagan departures. Reagan switched staff during the primaries, as his campaign gained steam. Gingrich’s staffers left at a low point, after embarrassments on Medicare policy, his vacation to the Greek Isles, and news he held massive credit accounts at the jeweler Tiffany’s. The primaries are still eight months away. Reagan lined up replacements before he pushed out his old staffers. Ten days after Gingrich’s staff left en masse, The Des Moines Register reported that Gingrich had yet to replace his Iowa staff. At the Atlanta Press club, Gingrich referenced Reagan campaign history to drive home the fairly vanilla point that "campaigns go up and down." On Fox News, his point that he had "exactly the same" problems as Reagan in 1980 is outrageous self-flattery. Reagan was on an upswing when his staffers left. Gingrich’s campaign is in a rut. Reagan had replacements ready. Gingrich did not. Reagan pushed out his staffers to run a more competitive campaign. Gingrich’s left him because they thought he wouldn’t do what it takes to win. Gingrich started off in Atlanta with a statement about Reagan that was close to the truth, but as he repeated it, he embellished the facts so much that only a kernel of truth remained. Gingrich might wish he had Reagan’s problems. But on this one he deserves a Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2011-07-08T06:00:00	2011-06-27	['Ronald_Reagan', 'Newt_Gingrich']
pomt-06915	Says members of the military have sent him more campaign contributions than they’ve sent President Barack Obama and more than twice what they’ve sent other Republican presidential candidates.	true	/texas/statements/2011/jul/23/ron-paul/ron-paul-says-members-military-have-given-him-far-/	If he were president, U.S. Rep. Ron Paul says, the United States would remove its forces from Afghanistan as "quickly as the ships could get there." In a July 20 interview with PBS’s "NewsHour," the Lake Jackson Republican continued: "It's insane on what we're doing. And I'll tell you one thing about this business about the military: We just had a quarterly (campaign finance) report, and they listed all the money that all the candidates got from the military. I got twice as much as all the other candidates put together on the Republican side, and even more than Obama got, which tells me that these troops want to come home as well because they know exactly what I'm talking about." There’s no clear-cut way to gauge why members of the military gave to Paul’s campaign or to others. But we wondered if Paul was squared away on how much more money his presidential campaign reaped from members of the military. A posting on his campaign website the same day he appeared on "NewsHour" sheds a little light. Headlined "Ron Paul Campaign Raises Most Donations From Military," it says that Paul has "raised more than any other current presidential candidate in donations from members of the military. Of those donors who indicated their occupation and employer, Paul topped the other contenders." Next, we turned to the presidential candidates’ latest campaign finance filings compiled by the Federal Election Commission, which breaks out donations by donors’ employers. In an interview, commission spokeswoman Mary Brandenberger told us the agency makes sure that each report complies with a federal law requiring candidates to list the occupation of each donor of $200 or more. A caveat: We did not achieve accounting-quality math in this look; there’s no quick way to do so. It’s also possible we missed a donation or two. Consider the numbers that follow in the ballpark. That said, from April through June, Paul fielded more than $25,000 from individuals who listed their employer as a branch of the military. Combined, six other Republican presidential candidates listed donations from members of the military totaling about $9,000. Our most-to-least breakdown: Herman Cain, $2,850; Mitt Romney, $2,750; Michele Bachmann, $2,250; Newt Gingrich, $500; and Tim Pawlenty and Rick Santorum, $250 each. On the Democratic side, Obama’s campaign received more than $16,000 in donations from members of the military. After we conducted this rough check, Paul’s campaign spokesman, Gary Howard, said by email that their numbers showed that Paul garnered $34,480 from members of the military; other GOP candidates fielded $13,848 and Obama took in $19,849. Summing up, Paul’s military-connected contributions for the three months more than double such contributions to all the other Republican presidential candidates—and they also exceed Obama’s. We rate his statement True.	None	Ron Paul	None	None	None	2011-07-23T15:28:09	2011-07-20	['Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-09235	On Sandra Day O'Connor: "I think one reason she was a good judge is she had no judicial experience" before she joined the Supreme Court.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/12/harry-reid/reid-claims-oconnor-had-no-previous-judicial-exper/	In a recent Senate floor speech, Democratic Leader Harry Reid likened Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan to another woman who sat on the court, Sandra Day O'Connor. "One of my favorite Supreme Court Justices in recent years has been Sandra Day O’Connor, not because she’s a Republican, but because she was a good judge. I think one reason she was a good judge is she had no judicial experience," Reid said on May 11, 2010. He pointed out that O'Connor served in the Arizona state legislature, giving her a different perspective on legal matters. "I think Solicitor General Kagan will bring a lot of those same views ... to the bench. That is, she has fresh ideas, she's been out in the real world recently," Reid said. Indeed, before taking a role in Obama's administration, Kagan was the dean of Harvard Law School, a law professor and an advisor to former President Bill Clinton. Prior to that, she served as a clerk for Judge Abner Mikva of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and Justice Thurgood Marshall of the U.S. Supreme Court. But Kagan has never been a judge, something her critics are quick to point out. O'Connor, who retired from the court 2005, also had a variety of jobs, serving as Deputy County Attorney of San Mateo County, California, and as an Arizona state senator. But unlike Kagan, O'Connor had been a judge. In 1975, O'Connor was elected a judge of the Maricopa County Superior Court, where she served until 1979, when she was appointed to the Arizona Court of Appeals, according to her biography on the U.S. Supreme Court Web site. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan nominated O'Connor to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court. We asked Reid's spokesman, Jim Manley, if we were missing something, and he wrote that Reid had simply misspoken. So, O'Connor had six years of judicial experience before she was nominated for a seat on the highest court. We find Reid's claim to be False.

pomt-07608	Says taxpayer resources are being used "to facilitate private political agendas" through automatic payroll deduction of union dues.	mostly false	/florida/statements/2011/mar/22/john-thrasher/what-does-it-cost-governments-automatic-payroll-de/	Some Republicans in the Florida Legislature are squaring off against unions over a measure that would prohibit public employers from collecting union dues through automatic payroll deductions. Republicans call the measure "paycheck protection," and say it gives individual union members more power over how their dues money is spent. The law would prohibit public unions from utilizing payroll deductions and would require unions to get annual authorizations from members to use their dues for political reasons. But opponents liken the measure to union busting, saying it will make it more difficult for unions to collect dues. They also argue that the law is unnecessary because Florida is a right-to-work state where no employee can be forced to join a union and pay union dues. By choosing to join the union and pay dues, members are effectively supporting the union's agenda. The back-and-forth has played out several times in House and Senate committee hearings where the bill has been considered. The House version, HB 1021, is being sponsored by Rep. Chris Dorworth, R-Lake Mary. Its Senate companion, SB 830, is sponsored by Sen. John Thrasher, R-St. Augustine. Thrasher argued before the Senate Community Affairs Committee on March 14, 2011, that another reason to support his bill is to remove the government costs of processing union dues collections -- which in turn could be used for political purposes. Thrasher said he had heard from taxpayers who thought "their resources ought not be used to facilitate private political agendas." In the middle of a complex policy discussion, this seemed like an important fact to pin down -- what do governments spend on collecting union dues through payroll deductions? We caught up with Thrasher on the Senate floor to ask him if he had more information about the costs to government. He said he did not, but that there had to be some cost just by the nature of the government performing a task -- payroll deduction -- on behalf of a private entity. "We need to get state and local governments out of the business of being involved in political purposes," he said, echoing comments he made to the Senate committee members. Payroll deduction is common for all workers. Employees automatically have money taken out of their paycheck to pay for all kinds of things. Some deductions are voluntary: student loans, charitable donations, health insurance, life insurance, union dues. Some deductions are not: taxes, alimony and other court-ordered deductions. The state of Florida currently has 364 groups or agencies that have the ability to take money directly from employees' paychecks. Here's the entire list provided to PolitiFact Florida by the state Chief Financial Officer's Office. Three different state legislative analysts have examined the bill, and all at least attempted to see how much governments spend deducting union dues from pay checks. The answer was generally not much, if anything. A House staff analysis said the elimination of payroll deduction for employee unions "may result in a positive, but insignificant, fiscal impact on public employers." A second House analysis said the elimination of payroll deductions "may result in a neutral fiscal impact to public employers." A Senate staff analysis declared the fiscal impact to governments "indeterminate." The CFO's office, which oversees the state payroll system through the Bureau of State Payrolls, told PolitiFact Florida that the process for setting up payroll deduction is "by and large automated." Spokeswoman Alexis Lambert said it's as simple as some group requesting a deduction, that request being approved or denied, and then the bureau assigning a deduction code. "The bureau's deduction code process is, by and large, automated and represents a minimal cost," Lambert said. Practically speaking, there is some personnel time required to set up the deduction and that's about it. State statutes also permit governments to ask unions to pay for deduction costs as part of collective bargaining. Section 447.303, which discusses dues collection for public employees, says that "reasonable costs to the employer of said deductions shall be a proper subject of collective bargaining." And then there's Dorworth, the House sponsor, who told members of the House Budget Committee on March 21, 2011, that eliminating payroll deductions isn't a cost-savings measure. In responding to a question about the cost of eliminating the payroll deductions, Dorworth said, "I tend to agree. There's not any (financial) impact either way." Whatever the state spends on processing payroll deductions, it is so small no one can quantify it. Governments also could ask unions to pay for the cost as part of a union's collective bargaining agreement. There are reasons to vote for this bill, and Dorworth and Thrasher have articulated them, but cost isn't one of them. To us, that makes Thrasher's claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-07182	Says six of the state’s 58 family planning centers had to close because of Gov. Chris Christie’s budget cuts.	true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jun/10/loretta-weinberg/state-sen-loretta-weinberg-says-6-new-jerseys-58-f/	The elimination of nearly $7.5 million in funding for family planning services helped state lawmakers plug a multibillion-dollar budget gap last year. But that’s not all it did, according to state Sen. Loretta Weinberg (D-Bergen). She says the cuts forced six of 58 family planning centers to close. "In the current budget, the budget under which we are operating, the governor stripped out seven and a half million dollars that went to family planning centers throughout the state of New Jersey," Weinberg said at a discussion she hosted with women’s health care providers and other female Democratic legislators. "At the beginning of this current budget year, we had 58 family planning centers, we now have 52. Six have closed and others have cut back their hours." PolitiFact New Jersey decided to check this claim, as lawmakers continue battling over funding for family planning services in New Jersey and nationally. In June 2010, the state Assembly and Senate passed a bill that would restore the $7.45 million in funding cut for family planning services. Gov. Chris Christie vetoed the bill, S2139, saying New Jersey residents have access to "comprehensive reproductive health care services" at other sites and the state can’t afford to "provide duplicative funding for family planning centers." Since then, Donna Leusner, spokeswoman for the state Department of Health and Senior Services, said her agency has been notified that six sites have closed: Westampton and Brown Mills locations run by the Burlington County Health Department; Planned Parenthood of Southern New Jersey’s Cherry Hill center; FamCare, Inc.’s Millville facility; the Bayonne Women’s Health and Family Planning Center; and Planned Parenthood of Greater Northern New Jersey’s Dover site. The state Senate passed another bill, S2899, on May 23 that would restore the funding, but the Assembly has not yet voted on the measure. The organizations that ran the six centers told PolitiFact New Jersey that state funding cuts forced the closures. Ralph Shrom, a spokesman for Burlington County, said the Westampton clinic and a satellite location at Deborah Hospital in Brown Mills closed at the end of 2010. In Camden County, CEO of Planned Parenthood of Southern New Jersey Lynn Brown said her organization closed its family planning services center in Cherry Hill, a site that was operating one day a week, in fall 2010. A Millville location run by FamCare, Inc. that also operated one day a week closed on Dec. 1, according to Kimberly McKown-Strait, the organization’s executive director. The women’s health center in Bayonne officially closed on April 29, Bayonne spokesman Joe Ryan said. Triste Brooks, the president and CEO of the Planned Parenthood of Greater Northern New Jersey, said the organization’s Dover site closed at the end of 2010. So let’s review: Six family planning clinics closed during the past fiscal year and representatives from each blamed the loss of state funding for the closure. Christie signed a budget that eliminated $7.45 million in funding for family planning services that the Democratic-controlled Legislature passed. The governor also vetoed a measure that would have restored the funding. We rate Weinberg’s statement that the governor’s cuts forced six family planning centers to close True.

pomt-14189	In the 2014 election, "80 percent of poor people did not vote."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/24/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-said-poor-people-dont-vote/	Income inequality is the core issue of Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign, and he said it may also be why he’s behind Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary. Meet the Press host Chuck Todd asked Sanders why he thought 16 of 17 states with large wealth gaps were won by Clinton. "Well, because poor people don’t vote. I mean, that’s just a fact," Sanders said. "That’s a sad reality of American society. And that’s why we have to transform one, as you know, one of the lowest voter turnouts of any major society of Earth. We have done a good job of bringing young people. But in America today, the last election in 2014, 80 percent of poor people did not vote." Is turnout among the poor really that low? The data shows that we’ve done slightly better at getting out the vote among low-income people than what Sanders suggests, but not by much. Sanders’ policy director Warren Gunnels pointed us to a report by the left-leaning policy and advocacy group Demos, which used data from the Census Bureau. "According to Demos, only one in four of those earning less than $10,000 voted in 2014," Gunnels said. "Even worse, the turnout was just 12 percent among 18- to 24-year-olds earning less than $30,000." In other words, roughly 75 percent of people in the lowest income bracket didn’t vote in the last midterm elections. However, there’s one catch to this figure. While an annual income of less than $10,000 is undoubtedly "poor," the poverty threshold in 2014 also includes family incomes above $10,000. Sean McElwee, a policy analyst with Demos who authored the report, told us to look at annual incomes under $30,000 instead. The turnout rate for that group was 31.5 percent, which means 68.5 percent of poor people didn’t vote in 2014, about 10 percentage points less than what Sanders said. "Sanders is indeed correct to highlight low turnout among the poor as an important factor that biases policy in favor of the wealthy," McElwee said. As PolitiFact has reported, census data may overstate the turnout rates, as it’s based on self-reporting. So it’s possible that Sanders’ 80 percent figure is closer to actual rates than what the survey shows, but this is speculative. Sanders is more on target if we look at a definition of "poor" that is not based on income. A 2015 Pew Center survey looked at the politics of financial security, which analysts defined as having a credit card, a savings or checking account, and a retirement or investment plan; not needing to borrow money; not falling behind on bills, rent or mortgage payments; and not receiving food assistance or Medicaid benefits. The survey found that just 20 percent of the least financially secure were "likely voters" in 2014 compared to 69 percent of the most financially secure. Turnout always drops in midterm elections, when the White House isn’t at stake, and overall turnout in 2014 was the worst it had been in 72 years. Nonetheless, census data shows turnout is consistently lower among the poor than other income groups: So why are the poor less likely to vote? The reasons are interconnected, if not unsurprising. For one, the political process sets hurdles for the poor. Registration barriers are key, said McElwee of Demos, pointing to census data that shows that low-income people are far less likely to be registered voters. Voter ID laws, for example, impose costs that people struggling to make ends meet can’t really afford. The Government Accountability Office reported in 2014 that a driver’s license can cost between $5 to $58.50 in states with voter ID laws. And nearly 500,000 eligible voters don’t have convenient access to an ID-issuing office, according to a 2012 study by New York University. The poor also make up 55 percent of people who can’t vote (which include felons and immigrants as well as residents of Washington D.C., and U.S. territories), according to a 2013 Harvard University working paper. "This means that they can't vote but also they won't be mobilized by parties, who base their mobilization off of voter files," McElwee said. Being poor also means you cannot afford to devote time to the political process. The Pew study found that just 26 percent of the least financially secure knew which party controlled Congress compared to 62 percent of the most affluent. Similarly, compared to affluent non-voters, low-income non-voters were more likely to list disinterest, forgetting to vote, health and issues of access as reasons why they didn’t vote, according to census data. "They often have inflexible jobs, have limited transportation options to get to the polls, and/or insufficient knowledge about democracy and the choices they face," said Zoltan Hajnal, a political science professor at the University of California, San Diego. "The poor also often lack efficacy and don’t feel like their votes count as much." Our ruling Sanders said, "In 2014, 80 percent of poor people did not vote." The figure is a bit high if we look at turnout by income. In 2014, about 75 percent of people who made under $10,000 and about 69 percent of those who made under $30,000 didn’t vote. If we look at financial insecurity, however, Sanders is right on the money.

pomt-10348	Obama worked with "Sen. Dick Lugar, a Republican, to help lock down loose nuclear weapons."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/15/barack-obama/obama-lugar-measure-included-weapons-of-mass-destr/	In a new television ad, Sen. Barack Obama makes the case for America leading international efforts to control nuclear weapons. "The single most important national security threat that we face is nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists," Obama says in the ad. "What I did was reach out to Sen. Dick Lugar, a Republican, to help lock down loose nuclear weapons. We have to lead the entire world to reduce that threat. We can restore America's leadership in the world." We checked into Obama's legislative record with Sen. Lugar, a Republican from Indiana. Obama's first foreign travel as a U.S. senator was with Lugar in August 2005, when the two men visited nuclear weapons storage and dismantlement facilities in Russia, Ukraine and Azerbaijan. The following spring, Lugar and Obama authored a Senate bill that authorized the president to carry out a program to provide assistance to foreign countries to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The bill does not specifically list different types of weapons of mass destruction, but we'll take as a given that it includes nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. The larger part of the legislation was a separate measure to stop the spread of conventional weapons, notably shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles that the legislation refers to as man-portable air defense systems, or MANPADS. The bill's provisions were incorporated into a House bill that passed later that year and was signed into law in January 2007. The Lugar-Obama initiative is modeled after a 1991 bill authored by Lugar and former Democratic Sen. Sam Nunn. The Nunn-Lugar program provided U.S. funding and expertise to the former Soviet Union to dismantle stockpiles of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. We'll note here that the legislation Obama and Lugar sponsored did not deal solely with nuclear weapons, but rather with all weapons of mass destruction, and that a good bit of their legislation focused on conventional weapons. But it does seem like part of the legislation's intent is to "help lock down loose nuclear weapons." For that reason, we find Obama's statement to be True.

pomt-08362	"When President, then candidate, Obama was asked to disclose some of his donors because there was suspicion of their being the foreign source of money into his campaign, they refused to do it."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/26/michael-steele/michael-steele-says-obamas-claims-hypocritical-his/	For weeks, Democratic leaders have been complaining about the tens of millions of dollars being poured into attack ads against the party's candidates. The ads have been funded by independent groups -- like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Karl Rove's Crossroads GPS -- that have no legal requirement (or inclination) to disclose their donors. President Barack Obama and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi say those groups have allowed anonymous special interest groups, perhaps even foreign corporations, undo influence on this election, threatening our very democracy. Asked about it on NBC's Meet the Press on Oct. 23, Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele called the Democrats' charge hypocritical. "When President, then candidate, Obama was asked to disclose some of his donors because there was suspicion of their being the foreign source of money into his campaign, they refused to do it. So don't give me this high-and-mighty, holier-than-thou attitude about special interests flooding the political marketplace." We've fact-checked several Democrats' claims about attack ads aimed at their candidates being financed by secret foreign donors. Here, we're checking the counter-claim from Steele, that during the 2008 presidential campaign, "Obama was asked to disclose some of his donors because there was suspicion of their being the foreign source of money into his campaign, they refused to do it." Despite the context of the conversation, Steele was not contending that the Obama campaign was asked to disclose donors to independent groups funding attack ads. That's a somewhat new phenomenon this election cycle. Trade groups and other 501 (c) groups were always allowed to keep donors anonymous. But the Supreme Court's Citizen United case upped the stakes with a ruling that allows corporations to contribute unlimited amounts to independent efforts to support or oppose a candidate. What Steele was talking about is different. We contacted the RNC for details about Steele's claim and were pointed toward an Associated Press investigation that found the Obama campaign had not properly safeguarded against illegal foreign donations in the run-up to the 2008 presidential election. Candidates can, of course, accept foreign donations from American citizens living overseas, and they are supposed to return any money donated by foreign nationals. But the AP investigation found "clear evidence that the campaigns of both Obama and John McCain took money first and asked questions later. Shining a light on a weakness in the nation's campaign finance laws, the review turned up a smattering of illegal foreign donations to Obama as well as missing details in federal paperwork the law requires from Obama and McCain." The issue was particularly striking, the story noted, as Obama was getting two-thirds of his contributions via the Internet. Online donors were asked to check a box certifying they were U.S. citizens. Although the Federal Elections Commission instructs campaigns to seek a donor's current U.S. passport when accepting money from an overseas address, many donors contacted by the AP said they were not asked to produce one before making their donation. In one case highlighted in the story, the Obama campaign accepted a $500 donation from a Canadian man who wrote "I am not an American citizen!" on his contribution. The Federal Elections Commission requires that "treasurers of political committees exercise best efforts to obtain, maintain and report the complete identification of each contributor whose contributions aggregate more than $200 per calendar year." The Obama campaign maintained it was complying with the law and that it met the "best efforts" standard with extensive "back-end review" of donations. That means the campaign accepted money and later checked to make sure the donations were proper. And campaign officials say that when they discovered illegal contributions from foreign nationals, the money was returned. The RNC raised another issue to underpin Steele's accusation. It cited an Oct. 29, 2008, story in the Washington Post that called out the Obama campaign for "allowing donors to use largely untraceable prepaid credit cards that could potentially be used to evade limits on how much an individual is legally allowed to give or to mask a contributor's identity." According to the story, revelations about questionable donations from individuals using fake names "prompted conservative bloggers to further test Obama's finance vetting by giving money using the kind of prepaid cards that can be bought at a drugstore and cannot be traced to a donor." The story did not quantify how much the Obama campaign received in prepaid credit cards. The Washington Post claim, though, wasn't that the Obama campaign refused to disclose the donors. It's that the campaign, by accepting donations via prepaid credit cards, made it impossible to verify whether the person was an American citizen or had exceeded donation limits. "You don't know," said Doug Heye, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee. "The rhetoric from the Obama campaign (about campaign finance disclosure) never matched the reality." In October 2008, the RNC asked the Federal Election Commission to look into every donation, large and small, made to the Obama campaign. According to the complaint, "The RNC believes that" the Obama campaign "has (1) accepted prohibited foreign national contributions and (2) knowingly done so through its failure to reasonably investigate questionable contributions originating abroad." Heye said the FEC has not yet responded to the complaint. Brad Woodhouse, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, said "the Obama campaign required donors to check a box confirming that they were U.S. citizens or green-card holders and refunded any contribution that came from any foreign national or other prohibited source." Woodhouse said the charge by Steele was "a lie – and is just smokescreen by the RNC to distract from the secret money being spent by its allies like the Chamber of Commerce and Karl Rove." Contributions from foreign nationals and people using fake names inevitably slip into campaigns accepting donations from hundreds of thousands of people, said Dave Levinthal of the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. It's incumbent on campaigns to make a good faith effort to identify those bad donations and return them. Levinthal said he didn't remember the issue of illegal contributions being a "a huge, overriding issue" in the 2008 presidential campaign. In fact, an analysis of campaign contributions by the Center for Responsive Politics found that the Obama campaign scored slightly higher than McCain's when it came to full disclosure of donors. The center found the Obama campaign fully disclosed 90 percent of the donations to the campaign, as opposed to 87 percent for the McCain campaign. The report found no information about the donor's employer and/or occupation listed for 6 percent of the Obama campaign's contributions, as opposed to 9 percent for McCain. We think Steele's comment is misleading in the context of responding to Democrats' complaints about tens of millions of dollars anonymously making their way into this election via independent groups like Crosssroads GPS. Steele's comments aren't directly related to that issue. The RNC says Steele was referring to the fact that the Obama campaign accepted donations from prepaid credit cards, which makes it almost impossible to verify the donor. It may be a legitimate campaign finance issue, but it's not the same as saying that the Obama campaign was asked during the 2008 presidential campaign to reveal its donors and refused (as Steele alleged). The campaign readily provided the names of large donors as required by law. And there's no evidence that contributions from prepaid credit cards were anywhere near the huge sums being spent by independent groups in this election. As for accepting money from foreign nationals, that's an issue all campaigns deal with (though more so for Obama, who got a lot of money from Americans overseas). Again, it's not that the Obama campaign was asked for names of foreign donors and refused. The campaign had names, and in most cases assurances from the donors, that they were American citizens. The allegation in the Washington Post story was that the campaign's vetting of foreign donations was not stringent enough up front. There was no issue of the Obama campaign willfully refusing to disclose the names of foreign donors. In fact, it was the disclosure of those names that allowed AP reporters to discover some of the donations were improper. And so we rate Steele's comment False.

On June 12, he told the Rhode Island House that it was illegal to transmit a lie on the Internet, on radio, on TV, or over the phone about anything. "Under current law, if you go on a dating website and you say you're 32 and you're actually 42, you've committed a misdemeanor under our current law. Any transmission of false information makes you a criminal under Rhode Island state law," he said during the final day of the session. He was pushing for House Bill 7389 to change the law that makes all electronic lying illegal. He wanted to keep the section that made it a felony if you lie to get payment from a claim, but delete the paragraph that made it a misdemeanor to engage in all other types of lying. To say PolitiFact Rhode Island was intrigued would be an understatement. Could many of the Pants-On-Fire politicians and pundits we've exposed during the past two years have faced a fine of up to $500, and up to a year in jail? Well, if it was true then, it isn't now. The bill passed the House and Senate, Governor Chafee signed it on June 20, and the legislation took effect immediately. In Rhode Island, telling white lies on the Internet is now officially legal. But the question persists: Was Blazejewski correct at the time he made the statement? The statute involved is Section 11-52-7 of the Rhode Island General Laws. Paragraph (a), which is still in effect, makes it a felony to transmit false data "for the purpose of submitting a claim for payment." Paragraph (b) dealt with electronic lying for any other purpose. It said, "Whoever intentionally or knowingly: (1) makes a transmission of false data; or (2) makes, presents or uses or causes to be made, presented or used any data for any other purpose with knowledge of its falsity, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor . . . " During a three-minute hearing on the bill on March 13, the lone witness, Steven Brown of the Rhode Island Affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union, called for its repeal because "any other purpose" is overly broad and a violation of free speech. "Make sure that none of us get charged with a crime for lying on a dating site, telling our spouse that we're stuck in a meeting when we're somewhere else, or a variety of other situations that many of us may have encountered over the years," he urged the legislators. At the Rhode Island attorney general's office, spokeswoman Amy Kempe consulted with Ronald Gendron, chief of the white collar crime and public corruption unit. (Note: We talked with her before Governor Chafee signed the bill.) "On the surface, someone could take that portion of the statute literally" and prosecute for any lie, she said. But "that was neither the intent nor is it the application of the statute." Laws need to be interpreted in context, and this statute, as a whole, "was clearly designed to accommodate a fraud for money," said Kempe. Paragraph (a) made it a felony to transmit a lie "for the purpose of submitting a claim for payment," such as for an insurance loss. Paragraph (b), in its reference to "any other purpose," really only applies to other types of deception where financial gain is involved, she said. Finally, Jared Goldstein, a law professor at Roger Williams University School of Law, said the plain language of the law did "indeed appear to make it a crime to knowingly or intentionally send any false information over the Internet, without any limitation on the context or subject matter. If read literally, the language would seem to cover giving false information on a dating site. Or lying to a friend in an e-mail message. Or maybe even clicking 'Like' for a friend's photo that you don't really like." "If the provision is read in that literal way," he said, "it would almost certainly be unconstitutionally overbroad because it would prohibit a huge amount of Constitutionally-protected speech. Even if it is not read that way, but construed narrowly to cover only false information that can constitutionally be prohibited, the law may still be unconstitutionally vague, because it doesn't clearly tell the public what is prohibited." Our ruling Rep. Christopher Blazejewski said that "Under current law, if you go on a dating website and you say you're 32 and you're actually 42, you've committed a misdemeanor." That's indeed what the law said at the time. (It has since been changed.) Whether you risked prosecution if you told such a lie would have been another matter entirely. The attorney general's office said the statute was only meant to apply to lies designed to garner financial gain. And the law professor we checked with says it was such a broad, vague limit on free speech, it was probably unconstitutional. Nonetheless, the PolitiFact judges rate Blazejewski's claim as True.

pomt-13687	Says Donald Trump "doesn't make a thing in America."	false	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/aug/01/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-went-overboard-calling-out-donald-/	Hillary Clinton followed her history-making DNC speech by staying in Philadelphia for an extra day and giving yet another speech Friday. The location was different, Temple University on North Broad Street rather than the Wells Fargo Center on South Broad, but much of the message was the same, primarily because she spent time attacking Donald Trump. At one point during the speech, Clinton said, "He doesn't make a thing in America." The comment came after a week of DNC speakers taking shots at Trump. Multiple politicians, including U.S. Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Clinton, pointed out many of Trump’s products are made in foreign countries, such as his vodka and his neckties. These are indeed made overseas. But what about everything? Has Trump really not made a thing in America? This was a quick fact to check. While many of his products have been made overseas, some are made in America, such as his suits. Amazon features more than a dozen Trump-brand suits. Yes, some are made in China and some have no country listed for where they’re made. But some are made in the United States. A previous PolitiFact check also found Trump-brand wine to be made here in the U.S. For a product to be considered made in the USA, according to the Federal Trade Commission, "all or virtually all" of the product has to be made in the United States. The FTC can bring legal action against companies suspected of making misleading claims about the origins of their products. On Trump’s website, he sells several apparel items, including the "Make America Great Again" hats, as well as t-shirts, signs and buttons. All of them are said to be made in America. Though photos on the internet circulated of one of his hats having been made in China, PolitiFact found that wasn’t true. According to the AP, the "Make America Great Again" hats are stitched at a small factory in Los Angeles. Workers at the factory in which the Make America Great Again hats are made told the AP the some of the materials that go into the hats are imported. Clinton’s campaign responded to an inquiry about Clinton’s statement by providing links to articles explaining where certain Trump items are made. It did not respond to questions about why Clinton said Trump had not made a thing in America or whether the campaign has discovered discrepancies in where Trump items are made that have not been reported. Our ruling Speaking in a packed Temple University gym, Hillary Clinton questioned Donald Trump’s ability to create jobs for Americans and said, "He doesn't make a thing in America." Many of Trump’s products are made overseas, but not all of them. At the least, some of his suits and the campaign memorabilia he sells on his website are made in the United States. We rule the claim False.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-08-01T07:37:53	2016-07-29	['United_States']
pomt-10614	"Barack (Obama) has one of his biggest supporters in terms of funding, the Exelon Corporation, which has spent millions of dollars trying to make Yucca Mountain the waste depository."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/18/hillary-clinton/exelon-staff-supports-obama/	When candidates debate in Nevada, you can bet Yucca Mountain will be mentioned. And Hillary Clinton had her facts in order during a Jan. 15, 2008, debate in Las Vegas. Yucca Mountain is the proposed site for a controversial proposal to store much of the nation's nuclear waste in one place. Predictably, most Nevadans oppose this. The original opening date for the site was in 1998, but opposition has prevented the project from going forward and its fate is unclear. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., is a powerful opponent. Both Clinton and Obama have urged that the project be shelved. A prominent supporter of Yucca Mountain, though, is Exelon Corp., an electric utility based in Chicago. Exelon operates the largest nuclear fleet (17 reactors) in the United States and the third-largest commercial nuclear fleet in the world, according to Exelon's Web site. In a speech to nuclear energy executives in May 2007, Exelon CEO John Rowe said permanent disposal at Yucca Mountain or a similar facility remains "a long-term imperative" for the industry, even while he acknowledged it would not happen soon. We asked a spokesman for Exelon if they've spent "millions" promoting Yucca Mountain. We were told they don't track their spending by project. Public records, though, indicate the company has spent more than $10-million on lobbyists between 2002 and 2007, with Yucca Mountain listed among its top issues. That doesn't count previous years; the Yucca Mountain project has been debated for more than 20 years. Meanwhile, campaign finance records confirm Exelon is one of Obama's top contributors. The Center for Responsive Politics found that Exelon employees were his sixth-largest corporate donor group. (No. 1 was Goldman Sachs.) The Obama campaign points to several mitigating factors: Obama opposes Yucca Mountain. Exelon is one of the largest companies and employers in Obama's hometown of Chicago. Obama has sponsored legislation specifically targeting Exelon after unplanned waste releases in Illinois. Obama has not accepted any money from Exelon lobbyists or Exelon's political action committee; rather, the contributions are from people who work at Exelon. Of all these points, it's the last we find most compelling. Obama is not taking money from Exelon as a corporate entity or PAC, rather he's accepting contributions from Exelon executives and employees. (Clinton, by contrast, accepts federal PAC money, though she hasn't accepted any from Exelon.) It's a small but real difference, so we rate her claim on Obama's ties to Exelon to be Mostly True.

pomt-09667	Senate health care legislation will "levy a new 'abortion premium' fee on Americans in the government-run plan."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/20/john-boehner/boehner-claims-senate-health-care-bill-includes-ab/	Republicans have found another flaw in the health care bill: They say Democrats are trying to impose a monthly abortion fee on anyone enrolled in the public health care option. "Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's (D-NV) massive, 2,074-page bill would levy a new 'abortion premium' fee on Americans in the government-run plan," wrote House Republican Leader John Boehner on the GOP's Web site. The House version of the health care bill included an amendment promoted by Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich., to prevent abortion from being offered through the public plan, as well as additional restrictions for insurers who sell on the exchange. But the Senate version of health care reform represents a clean slate and includes a provision similar to one added by Rep. Lois Capps, D-Calif., to the original version of the House legislation that would prevent the government from spending federal dollars on abortion procedures. Here's how the Senate bill would treat the issue: Health insurance companies participating in the insurance exchange, a virtual marketplace where consumers could compare and shop for insurance plans, could decide whether to offer abortion coverage. In each state, there would have to be at least one plan that offers the insurance and one that does not. People who get federal subsidies to help pay for coverage through the exchange could buy plans that offer abortion insurance. But the bill includes accounting rules to ensure that no tax dollars are used to pay for the procedure. The government can only pay for abortions in instances of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother, but the Health and Human Services secretary could decide to include abortion coverage beyond that. In any case, the public plan would be subject to the same rules. We've covered the many claims from the left and the right about how abortion would be treated under health care reform, and you can read all of them here . But Boehner's claim that the Senate bill includes a monthly "abortion fee" was new to us. Intrigued, we went directly to Page 122 of Section 1303 of the bill, the language Boehner is concerned about. That section deals with measures the government will take to ensure that no plan offered through the exchange will use federal dollars to cover abortion procedures. If a plan through the exchange does offer abortion coverage, "the issuer of the plan shall ... segregate an amount equal to the actuarial amounts determined under subparagraph for all enrollees," the language says. The Health and Human Services secretary "shall estimate the basic per enrollee, per month cost, determined on an average actuarial basis, for including coverage under a qualified health plan." Finally, the secretary "shall estimate such costs as if such coverage were included for the entire population covered; and may not estimate such a cost at less than $1 per enrollee per month." All that legalese means this: Because insurance companies participating in the exchange may not use tax dollars to pay for abortion procedures, they must ensure that an adequate amount of private funding -- which will come from private premiums -- is set aside. Per premium, that funding can be no less than $1 dollar a month; otherwise, it's up to the insurance company. All this is to ensure that there's enough private premiums to pay for abortions should participants need them. So, the bill does require that abortion coverage through the exchange be paid for with private premiums. But does the bill language dictate an abortion fee as Boehner says? Usha Ranji, a policy analyst for the Kaiser Family Foundation, says no. "I don't understand what [Boehner's] reference is to," she said. The provision simply "outlines some technical direction of how you would establish cost of an abortion benefit." Lara Cartwright-Smith of George Washington University's public health school concurred, adding that everyone participating in the exchange would have the option of choosing a plan that does not include abortion. So, back to Boehner's claim. The bill does not require a fee, or a charge above and beyond the premium cost specifically to cover abortions. And technically speaking, we don't know whether the public option will offer abortion coverage or not. Instead, it gives the Health and Human Services secretary a minimum for estimating the cost of covering abortions. So we give Boehner a False.

pomt-07671	Says women who need a sonogram in the eighth to 10th week of pregnancy have to get a transvaginal sonogram.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/mar/10/carol-alvarado/state-rep-carol-alvarado-says-women-who-are-10-wee/	In a Texas House debate March 2, Democratic state Rep. Carol Alvarado of Houston pressed the author of a proposal requiring women seeking an abortion to get a sonogram on whether he was aware that a sonogram is intrusive early in a woman’s pregnancy. "There are two different kinds of sonograms," she said. "The abdominal, which I think most of our colleagues may think ‘jelly on the belly’ that would be done there, but that’s not the case. A woman that is eight to 10 weeks pregnant would have to go (to get) a transvaginal sonogram." House Bill 15, which cleared the House March 7, requires women getting an abortion to first allow a medical professional to perform a sonogram, "display the live, real-time obstetric sonogram images in a quality consistent with current medical practice in a manner that the pregnant women may view them" and "make audible the live, real-time" heart beat. The Senate approved a different version of the proposal in February. We decided to check at what stage in their pregnancy women who need a sonogram would require the transvaginal kind. Alvarado told us that she meant to say that women who are up to eight to 12 weeks pregnant need a transvaginal sonogram because the better-known abdominal ultrasound doesn’t always produce a clear enough image. According to a medical encyclopedia on the University of Maryland Medical Center website, the transvaginal ultrasound looks at a woman’s reproductive organs by placing a probe into the vagina. The internal probe "sends out sound waves, which reflect off body structures. A computer receives these waves and uses them to create a picture." An abdominal ultrasound is performed externally, the site says. A water-based gel is spread over the woman’s pelvic area, which helps the probe transmit sound waves, generating an image. Alvarado’s office referred us to seven physicians to support her statement. Six responded, all saying transvaginal sonograms are usually preferred in the early weeks of pregnancy. Comments ranged from calling Alvarado’s statement "100 percent correct" to describing the transvaginal sonogram as "the best evaluation" that early in pregnancy. Other highlights: — Lisa Hollier, one of Alvarado’s recommended doctors, chairs the Texas district of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. She told us that if a sonogram is needed up to 10 weeks into a pregnancy, a transvaginal is necessary to attain a clear image and pick up the heartbeat. Hollier, who opposes the sonogram proposals, said that at eight to 10 weeks’ of pregnancy, the heart is hard to visualize using an abdominal ultrasound, particularly on obese women. — Matt Romberg, a Round Rock ob-gyn who also opposes the proposals, told us that he performs a sonogram to verify the location of the fetus, its viability and the stage of the pregnancy on women who are up to 10 weeks pregnant before performing the abortion. Ninety-nine percent of the time, he said, "I have to do a transvaginal" sonogram. — G. Sealy Massingill, a Fort Worth ob-gyn, told us that "at eight weeks or less, it’s almost impossible to see anything" without using a transvaginal sonogram. For other perspectives, we contacted the Washington-based Association of Reproductive Health Professionals, which seeks to improve reproductive health care through education. Beth Jordan, the association’s medical director, told us that in the early weeks of pregnancy, fetuses are easier to see on vaginal ultrasounds, though she said "there are cases when it’s difficult to (perform) a vaginal ultrasound and we have to use the abdominal devices." According to current clinical management guidelines produced by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, a sonogram in the first trimester may be performed using either an abdominal ultrasound or a transvaginal one. If the abdominal examination "is not definitive, a transvaginal scan or transperineal scan should be performed whenever possible." For a transperineal scan, the external probe is placed between the vulva and the rectum. Vicki Saporta, president of the National Abortion Federation, an association of abortion providers, told us it’s "possible to do an abdominal ultrasound early in pregnancy, but based on a woman’s weight, the position of the uterus, the size of the pregnancy, a transvaginal ultrasound can be more accurate." The federation opposes the Texas sonogram proposals, which Saporta said "put another obstacle in the way of women receiving abortion care." Eugene Toy, president of the Texas Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, told us that the medical standard of care for a patient seeking an abortion is to have a sonogram that allows the doctor to determine the stage of the pregnancy and identify problems. At less than eight weeks, "a vaginal probe would be necessary almost all the time," he said, though from the eighth to 10th week, it’s necessary one-third of the time. Kyleen Wright, president of Texans for Life, pointed us to Ralph Wiegman, a Grand Prairie ob-gyn who supports the sonogram legislation. Wiegman told us that the only time a transvaginal sonogram is needed is less than seven weeks into the pregnancy, or if the woman is obese. "At our pregnancy resource center, a vaginal ultrasound is reserved for those cases when you can’t get a good picture abdominal, or very early in the gestation," he said. Where does that leave us? Given that lawmakers were weighing whether to mandate sonograms in advance of abortions, we find reasonable Alvarado’s post-debate clarification that she intended to characterize sonograms through the first 10 weeks of pregnancy and not just a two-week segment. Most of the experts we reached agreed that to produce a clear image, a transvaginal sonogram is best, if not the only choice, up to about the seventh week of pregnancy. But between seven and 10 weeks, another type of sonogram may produce a viewable image, according to some doctors. We rate Alvarado’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-00861	Wisconsin is "dead last in the Midwest for job creation."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/mar/16/mark-pocan/wisconsin-dead-last-midwest-job-creation/	When it comes to Madison Democrats making pronouncements about job growth in Wisconsin, the term "dead last" has a recurring allure. Mary Burke relentlessly made dead-last claims while running against Gov. Scott Walker in the 2014 election. In checking two of them, which were made with some variation, we rated one True and the other False. Now comes U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan. On March 10, 2015, the day after Walker signed legislation that bars private-sector workers from being required to pay union fees, Pocan appeared on a Wisconsin Public Radio talk show. Host Joy Cardin asked Pocan why he thinks the so-called right-to-work law "is going to be bad for Wisconsin." Pocan, who opposed the measure, began his reply by saying: "Well, first of all, I think Governor Walker has taken us down the path of his presidential aspirations, and I feel that he is really ignoring the needs of Wisconsin. We're dead last in the Midwest for job creation." "Dead last" just won’t die. OK, we’re game for another go at this. So, four months after the election and with Walker positioning himself for a White House run in 2016, where does Wisconsin rank now? The numbers Pocan’s office pointed us to two news articles, both from December 2014, that reported on federal data for the private sector -- that is, non-government, non-farm jobs. The data is from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, which tracks the economy in rolling 12-month increments. The measurements are done every three months, but they also lag by many months. The quarterly figures have been called the gold standard because they are based on a census of 96 percent of the nation's employers in the public and private sectors. That means the data is far more reliable than monthly jobs data, which are based on a sample of only 3 percent of employers and are often subject to significant revisions. In examining the quarterly figures, we focus on the percentage increase in private sector jobs, rather than raw numbers, an approach that levels the playing field among states of varying sizes. Pocan referred to the latest available quarterly data, which measures job growth from June 2013 to June 2014. So what do the figures show? Among the 10 Midwestern states we’ve checked on previous "dead last" claims, Wisconsin is at the bottom, if not "dead last": State Percentage of private-sector job growth, June 2013-June 2014 1. North Dakota 4.8 2. Michigan 2.7 3. (tie) Indiana, Iowa 1.8 5. Illinois 1.7 6. (tie) Minnesota, Nebraska, Ohio 1.6 9. (tie) Wisconsin, South Dakota 1.5 Walker spokeswoman Laurel Patrick responded to Pocan's claim by pointing out that Wisconsin ranked sixth among the 10 -- ahead of Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota and North Dakota -- in raw numbers of jobs created. But again, that approach doesn't take into account how the states differ in size. Indeed, those four states are all smaller in population than Wisconsin. It’s worth noting that the less-reliable monthly job figures indicate Wisconsin is on the upswing. Employers added 40,600 jobs during the last four months of 2014 -- which was more than were added in the full year in any of the first three years of Walker's first term. But it is certainly fair for Pocan to use the most recent release of the most reliable numbers. The next batch, covering the third quarter of 2014, is scheduled to be released March 19, 2015. Our rating Pocan said Wisconsin is "dead last in the Midwest for job creation." Among 10 Midwestern states -- in terms of percentage growth in private-sector jobs -- the latest figures show Wisconsin is tied for ninth. So, not quite "dead last." We rate Pocan’s statement Mostly True. To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s web page.

pomt-09331	"No one questioned that she (Judge Sotomayor) was out of the mainstream."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/13/charles-schumer/schumer-claims-no-one-questioned-sotomayor-was-out/	With the announcement that Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens is retiring, speculation has turned to whom President Barack Obama will nominate to replace him, and -- depending on the nominee -- how much of a fight Obama will encounter from Senate Republicans. On ABC's This Week on April 11, 2010, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said he doesn't expect a Republican filibuster. What Republican and Democrats alike want is "somebody who will follow the law, not make the law," Schumer said, and he pointed to the pick of Judge Sonia Sotomayor as evidence that Obama would choose someone "in the mainstream." "If you look at who President Obama has nominated, somebody like Judge Sotomayor, who got nine Republicans to vote for her, no one questioned that she was out of the mainstream," Schumer said. "The other nominees in many of the courts of appeals and district courts, he chooses people in the mainstream. So I don't think there's going to be a filibuster or a blocking." We are checking the claim that "no one questioned that she (Sotomayor) was out of the mainstream." We recalled that phrase came up a lot during the Sotomayor confirmation debate, so we did some checking. To start, we direct your attention to a July 13, 2009, AP story under the headline, "Sessions: Sonia Sotomayor 'out of mainstream.'" That's Sessions as in Sen. Jeff Sessions, the leading Judiciary Committee Republican. The AP wrote that just hours before Sotomayor's initial confirmation hearing, Sessions charged that Sotomayor is "out of the mainstream" of legal thinking and has a very activist judicial profile. Sessions criticized Sotomayor's much-discussed comment from a speech in 2001, that she hoped a "wise Latina" often would reach better conclusions than a white male without the same life experience. "She has criticized the idea that a woman and a man would reach the same result. She expects them to reach different results. I think that's philosophically incompatible with the American system," Sessions said on CBS's Face the Nation. Sessions was among 31 Republican senators who voted against Sotomayor's confirmation, though Sessions said afterward that he was glad that during the hearings Sotomayor rejected the "empathy standard" Obama referred to when he nominated her. And Sessions wasn't the only Republican to invoke the "out of the mainstream" claim: • In a press release issued Aug. 5, 2009, Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., took issue with Sotomayor's ruling in a gun case, saying, it "shows an alarming hostility to law-abiding gun owners across the country. That is a view that is certainly out of the mainstream in this nation." • In a press release issued Aug. 6, 2009, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said that at her confirmation hearing Sotomayor attempted to distance herself from several statements "and explain them away, most likely recognizing that they were controversial and out of the mainstream. However, in my mind, she was not very successful." • In a statement released on Aug. 4, 2009, Grassley said Sotomayor "openly questioned whether 'ignoring our differences as women, men, or even people of color...we do a disservice both to the law and society.' This is yet another example of an out of the mainstream judicial philosophy." • A June 29, 2009, story in Roll Call noted that talking points prepared for House and Senate Republicans urged members to make the case that Sotomayor's written statements, rulings and speeches "show an out of the mainstream view of the role of a judge." Perhaps Schumer's comment was one part hyperbole - that what he meant was "hardly anyone" claimed Sotomayor was out of the mainstream. But we're sticklers for words, and Schumer's absolute claim that "no one questioned that she was out of the mainstream" isn't accurate. We understand that "out of the mainstream" is a subjective term, but the fact is that a number of Republican senators used that exact phrase. We rule Schumer's statement False.

pomt-04419	Says the Obama administration "watered down sanctions" against Iran, delayed them and tried to stop Congress "from putting the tough sanctions in place."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/15/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-obama-administration-watered-down-s/	President Barack Obama’s administration "has no credibility" to challenge Iran’s nuclear aspirations, Rep. Paul Ryan argued in his debate with vice presidential rival Joe Biden. The pair outlined a sharp difference in approach to Iran as they sat side by side in Danville, Ky., on Oct. 11, 2012. The Wisconsin Republican, answering a question from moderator Martha Raddatz about using a military strike to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, argued: "In order to solve this peacefully -- which is everybody's goal -- you have to have the ayatollahs change their minds. Look at where they are. They're moving faster toward a nuclear weapon. It's because this administration has no credibility on this issue. It's because this administration watered down sanctions, delayed sanctions, tried to stop us from putting the tough sanctions in place. Now we have them in place because of Congress." We can’t read the ayatollahs’ minds, but we checked whether the Obama administration "watered down sanctions, delayed sanctions, tried to stop (Congress) from putting the tough sanctions in place." We found Ryan was oversimplifying a difference of opinion between Congress and the White House not over whether to pressure Iran — but the most effective way to go about it. Sanctions against Iran First, a little background. Iran has faced U.S. sanctions since its 1979 Islamic revolution. The United Nations and other nations have joined in sanctions since 2006 in response to Iran’s efforts to develop a nuclear weapon, according to the Congressional Research Service, which provides nonpartisan analysis to Congress. The Obama administration’s policy has been to combine sanctions with negotiations, seeking "additional U.S., U.N., and allied country sanctions whose cumulative effect could compel Iran to accept a nuclear bargain." The country now has the "most sweeping sanctions on Iran of virtually any country in the world," according to a February 2012 Congressional Research Service report. Last month’s report calls them "what many now consider to be ‘crippling’ sanctions." So, what’s Ryan’s argument? The Romney-Ryan campaign pointed us to news coverage of an Obama administration compromise in 2010 to earn China and Russia’s backing for new sanctions through the United Nations. The U.N. Security Council in 2010 voted to sanction Iran but didn’t include among those sanctions measures against the nation’s Central Bank because of opposition from the two nations, which have veto power on the council. The Obama administration instead said it would also push forward with tougher sanctions on its own. And indeed, Obama has signed into law several rounds of legislation and executive orders strengthening the U.S. position. (For a detailed look at U.S. sanctions against Iran, the Congressional Research Service regularly updates its report with new legislation and enforcement actions.) Ryan: Credit Congress, not Obama The Romney-Ryan campaign argues that Congress deserves credit for much of that, such as legislation targeting the Central Bank. A spokesman for Romney told PolitiFact in February that tougher sanctions imposed by the United States earlier this year "weren’t done by Obama," but through an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that Obama opposed, tried to water down, and won exceptions for. "In implementing them, he was only doing what he was required to by an act of Congress," Romney spokesman Ryan Williams told us. Meanwhile, Obama wrote a signing statement saying that the sanction’s requirements were nonbinding, Williams noted. (Obama wrote that the Iran sanctions section "would interfere with my constitutional authority to conduct foreign relations by directing the Executive to take certain positions in negotiations or discussions with foreign governments. Like section 1244, should any application of these provisions conflict with my constitutional authorities, I will treat the provisions as non-binding.") Obama also undermined the sanctions’ requirement for countries seeking exceptions to "significantly reduce" their Iranian crude oil purchases by leaving the definition of "significant" to the discretion of the secretary of state, Williams said. (Sens. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., and Mark Kirk, R-Ill., authors of the amendment, argued it should mean at least 18 percent.) The president issued exceptions to 20 of the top oil exporters from Iran, including China, the Romney-Ryan team said, citing a June 2012 New York Times article. For its part, meanwhile, the Obama administration argued that the amendment, which passed despite the administration's objections, could "alienate foreign countries, make it more difficult to pressure Iran and raise oil prices, which could actually help the Iranian economy," according to Foreign Policy’s The Cable. Experts: A push for flexibility, not weakness After decades of U.S. sanctions, there’s little left to ban between the United States and Iran, so new rules necessarily target other countries. But move too fast, and the United States risks losing the cooperation of nations it needs as allies in the wider push to isolate Iran, experts told us. Congress wants a crackdown; the executive branch wants diplomacy. Iran policy experts told us that while the Obama administration pushed back against Congress — including what you might call watering down and delaying enforcement of legislative initiatives — that doesn’t mean the administration wasn’t tough on Iran. Michael Levi of the Council on Foreign Relations, an independent, nonpartisan think-tank, told PolitiFact earlier this year that’s not evidence the Obama administration had a weak stance on Iran, it's just that Obama resisted letting Congress dictate the terms. "Flexibility is the watchword," he said. "It's really hard to argue that this administration hasn't brought strong pressure to bear on Iran." Leonard Spector of the Monterey Institute of International Studies at Middlebury College told us in February that the administration has been a driving force internationally to put pressure on Iran, even if it failed to get the U.N. to target Iran’s Central Bank. "Obama, unilaterally and in concert with the (European Union) and other allies, has gone much further," he said. Avner Cohen, a senior fellow at the Monterey Institute of International Studies and a Democrat, has told us it's legitimate to raise questions about whether the administration should have acted sooner to impose its own tougher sanctions. But he said it's more valuable to get other nations to join the effort. "To make something effective in the real world, it needs to pass the Security Council," he said. It’s true, he said, that the the administration "had to water down some of the language to pass it." But Ryan’s claim is "totally out of context," he concluded. James Jeffrey, a deputy national security adviser in the Bush administration and ambassador to Iraq and Turkey under Obama, said this kind of back-and-forth between Congress and the executive branch happens all the time. Congress wants to exert unilateral pressure, and the executive needs room for diplomacy with its allies. You could just as easily characterize what Ryan calls watering down as the Obama team "strengthening the ability to enforce" sanctions against Iran, he said. In fact, the United States and European Union, among others, are now putting so much economic pressure on the country that "many judge that Iran might soon decide it needs a nuclear compromise to produce an easing of sanctions," according to the Congressional Research Service’s September report. Our ruling Ryan argued that "this administration watered down sanctions, delayed sanctions, tried to stop (Congress) from putting the tough sanctions in place." He’s right that the Obama administration compromised with Russia and China to earn their backing in the U.N. Security Council, and pushed for legislative waivers and other flexibility from Congress as it organized an international coalition to counter Iran. But just because the administration resisted plans in Congress does not mean it failed to get tough sanctions imposed. In fact, that international diplomacy has resulted in "what many now consider to be ‘crippling’ sanctions." In fact, there’s now so much economic pressure on Iran that Congress’ research arm reports Iran may soon decide to seek a nuclear compromise. That’s the opposite of what Ryan’s critique suggests. He employs a sliver of truth in service of a misleading impression. We rate his claim Mostly False.

pomt-00696	The United States is "about to have the smallest Army since before WWII, the smallest Navy since WWI and the smallest Air Force ever."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2015/may/04/david-perdue/sen-perdue-overstates-real-reduction-us-armed-forc/	David Perdue rose on the Senate floor last week to lay out his vision for the country as Georgia’s freshman senator. The former Fortune 500 CEO talked about his fiscal priorities and concerns with the Obama administration’s foreign policy, before tying the two together with an oft-repeated claim. The United States is "about to have the smallest Army since before WWII, the smallest Navy since WWI and the smallest Air Force ever," Perdue said. "This is simply unacceptable." Republican leaders have made similar claims as a talking point against President Barack Obama since Mitt Romney’s failed presidential bid in 2012. The Truth-O-Meter has spun wildly on those statements about military size, and the implications that a shrinking military is a threat to national security, based on how they were framed. (Read more about those rulings here and here .) PolitiFact Georgia decided to see how Perdue would stack up in his statement. We reached out to Perdue’s staff, which cited a 2011 letter from then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, warning that including the Pentagon in sequestration cuts would be devastating. "Rough estimates suggest after 10 years of these cuts," Panetta wrote, "we would have the smallest ground force since 1940, the smallest number of ships since 1915, and the smallest Air Force in its history." The problem with that sourcing: the cuts have not come to pass. THE ARMY The Defense Department’s 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review shows the Army is on pace to pare down to about 450,000 soldiers by 2019. Under sequestration cuts – which lawmakers have so far kept from hitting the military – the number would drop to 420,000. But today, the Army has about 490,000 soldiers. That is a down from the 570,000 soldiers serving during the height of recent wars - but still not as small 460,000 soldiers serving at the turn of the century, after the end of the Cold War but before the 9/11 terror attacks, said David E. Johnson, a military historian and political scientist at the Rand Corporation. And it’s more than double the 269,000 Army soldiers in 1940, before a draft was enacted. "By strict numbers, at this moment, it is heading to among the smallest," Johnson said. "One of the smallest, but not at all the smallest." NAVY The Navy counts about 326,000 active-duty sailors today. But experts measure the Navy and Air Force size in terms of ships and aircraft available for deployment. The quadrennial review estimates a fleet of 234 battle force ships by 2019. In 1915, two years before the U.S. became part of World War I, the Navy had 231 deployable ships. Projected cuts have also not hit the Navy, which has 273 deployable ships today, according to the Department of the Navy website. And our allies and foes alike have kept their word to the 1922 Washington Naval Conference, which limits the world’s navies by tonnage as a solution to an early arms race. In other words, the Navy has been small since WWI not because of any single administration decision but due to a nearly century-old disarmament accord. AIR FORCE The Air Force’s history dates back to 1947, when it became a separate military branch after being part of the Army during World War II. The 2012 fact check on the same claim from Romney found that the branch had about 6,000 aircraft as of 2009. That was the lowest number since 1950, the earliest year available. That means Perdue, is most likely correct on the size of the Air Force, as commonly measured by experts. Moreover, the active duty strength of the Air Force – now at 359,000 – is projected to drop to about 328,000 by 2019, according to Air Force spokesman Lt. Col. Michael Coleman. That would be the lowest active duty strength since the 1947 tally of about 309,000, Coleman said. WHAT IT ALL MEANS So, if Perdue is right on the size of the Air Force but off on the other two branches, what does that mean for his overall point? Perdue used military size as evidence that the national debt is crippling the national security and specifically attacked the Obama administration for cutting military spending. Military history experts, though, warn that the comparisons on size are inaccurate, given advances in warfare technology. Johnson said that only 20 percent of bombs dropped in World War II hit within 1,000 meters of their target. Those planes carried up to 10 people. Today, one pilot and one plane can strike with the same precision. "The real issue to be addressed is the U.S. ability to project military power abroad to achieve its key national security objectives and how that power compares to others in the present who seek to prevent us from achieving them," said William Stueck, a historian at the University of Georgia. Even with recent cuts, the U.S. also still spends as much as the next seven biggest defense-spending countries combined, said Alex Roland, a military history professor at Duke University. While that does not resolve the question of whether current budgets are enough, it helps show that the national interest is clearly focused on spending resources on national security. That’s why sequestration cuts have yet to truly affect the Pentagon, even as resources were shifted to battle a bad economy while also winding down wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Stueck said. Perdue might have been better off leaving the numbers out of his argument then, and instead discussing the need to change priorities now that the economy has stabilized. The size does matter, Johnson said. But mostly as a way to show the presence of the United States globally and what happens if a crisis occurs and the U.S. does not have the presence to act swiftly. "The real comparison is, we didn’t do anything until 1942 in World War II," Johnson. "His point is better made to ask: In the world we are now, can we wait until there is an attack and then take another year to get anyone anywhere to do something about the problem?" That’s not what Perdue said. In his first Senate floor speech, he cited a shrinking military that the numbers do not fully bear out. Perdue does have a valid point to make, about a historical success in paying for a military whose strength and size make it more likely to be a deterrent than a singular battle force. But he complicates his point by relying on dated information and the wrong comparisons. His argument can be supported, but not with the numbers he provides. We rate his claim Half True.

pomt-10317	Obama said his proposed $1,000 emergency energy rebate "will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next 4 months."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/01/barack-obama/obama-right-about-increased-energy-costs/	In a town hall meeting in St. Petersburg, Fla., on Aug. 1, 2008, Sen. Barack Obama announced a proposal for a two-part emergency plan "to help struggling families make ends meet and get our economy back on track." One part is a $50-billion stimulus package that would be split: $25-billion to go to state governments facing big budget shortfalls; and $25-billion toward national infrastructure projects like highways and bridges. The other part of his emergency plan is a $1,000 energy rebate that he said "could go out to families as soon as this fall." "This rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months. Or, if you live in a state where it gets very cold in the winter, it will be enough to cover the entire increase in your heating bills. Or you could use the rebate for any of your other bills or even to pay down debt." Obama said he plans to pay for the rebate by taxing windfall profits of oil companies. We decided to check Obama's math, to see if his numbers were right about how far $1,000 would go this winter. First up, the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months. According to Energy Department figures for the latest available year, 2001, an average family household of four people consumed 1,519 gallons of gas a year. That comes to 506 gallons for four months. Now, here comes the tricky part, because while Obama refers to the increased cost of gas, he doesn't say between when and when. The national average for the price of gas on Aug. 1 was $3.90 a gallon; up from $2.86 on Aug. 1 last year. That's a $1.04 increase. At those prices, the increased cost this year for four months of gas would come to $526, which would obviously be covered by Obama's proposed $1,000 rebate. Even if you project out the increased cost based on the peak price of $4.11 a gallon on July 17, it only comes to an extra $632.50 for the next four months. So that part of Obama's equation is accurate. Next, we looked at whether, if you live in a state where it gets very cold in the winter, $1,000 will be enough to cover the entire increase in your heating bills. The National Energy Assistance Directors' Association tracks such things. In New England states, the association projects the additional cost for people who use home heating oil will be about $950. About half of New England's homes use home heating oil. For those with natural gas, the added cost is projected to be about $335 higher; $450 more for people who use propane; and $780 more for those who use electricity. So no matter what form of energy they use to heat their homes, Obama's rebate would cover it. "The numbers are just ridiculous," said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors' Association. "It's going to be really bad in cold weather states. People up there are in a total panic." Consider this stat: for a New England family making $50,000 a year, energy costs last winter ate up 22 percent of their overall pre-tax income; this winter it is projected to consume 38 percent. "How are these families going to make it through the winter?" Wolfe asked. Wolfe said a $1,000 rebate would help many struggling families buy time to transition to the higher costs. We find that Obama's numbers on increased energy costs are True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-08-01T00:00:00	2008-08-01	['None']
pomt-05621	The changes to Georgia’s tax and fee structure "is an overall tax cut."	true	/georgia/statements/2012/mar/26/brian-robinson/numbers-back-tax-claim-deal-spokesman/	Cheers and celebratory handshakes swept through the Georgia Legislature last week when it overwhelmingly passed a bill to overhaul much of the state’s tax code. But some good government types and fiscal watchdogs were disappointed by the process. It was unveiled and passed in less than a week. One top aide to Gov. Nathan Deal said the legislation, House Bill 386, is good for Georgia. "This pro-jobs, pro-family tax reform broadens the tax base so we can lower the tax burden overall," Deal spokesman Brian Robinson said in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution the day after the House passed the bill. "It’s important to remember ... that this is an overall tax cut. We can’t get away from that fact." Since some people have questions about the bill, and it passed so quickly, we wondered whether Robinson is right? Let’s take a look at the 56-page bill. If you’re married, you’ll probably like the bill. It would increase exemptions by $2,000 for married couples who file joint returns and by $1,000 each for spouses who file separately. If you’re retired, you may not like it. The bill would cap the exclusion on the state collecting taxes on nonwork income at $65,000 for Georgians 65 and older. The state’s current policy would allow the cap to rise significantly to $200,000 by 2015 and eventually no cap at all. If you frequently shop online, you may not like it. The legislation would impose a tax on some items purchased on the Internet. There are other changes as well. It would eliminate the annual ad valorem tax on vehicles that the state’s car owners pay on their birthdays. It would be replaced by a one-time title tax. The bill would end the sales tax exemption for film production activities but bring back the sales tax holiday a couple of times later this year and in 2013. HB 368 also would phase out most of the sales taxes on energy used in manufacturing, mining and newspaper publishing. There are other exemptions in the bill concerning agriculture and construction materials. State officials estimate the government will see a $62.8 million decline in revenue between now and the end of fiscal year 2015. Local governments would see a greater decline of nearly $200 million during the same time period, according to the state research, which was put in an eight-page fiscal note. The bill’s proponents believe the legislation will result in increased economic activity in the state and more jobs, which will more than make up for the estimated cuts. Robinson, who also holds the title of Deal’s deputy chief of staff, said he was specifically referring to the impact on state revenue. "Overall [which is the exact word I used], this decreases tax revenue," Robinson told PolitiFact Georgia. Georgia lawmakers tried a similar bill last year, but it never came up for a vote for several reasons, including concerns that the state’s revenue estimates were inaccurate. This year, there have been no widespread complaints about the numbers, although there were complaints that not enough time had been allowed to properly review the proposal. The state’s figures show a $22.7 million surplus in state revenue in FY 2015, which begins July 1, 2014, and ends June 30, 2015. There is a deficit in FY 2013 and FY 2014 of a combined $85.5 million to the state. The difference between FY 2015 and the two other years is that the sales tax holiday and the construction materials exemption are not included in FY 2015. The sales tax holidays amount to an estimated annual $40 million net loss to the state while the construction exemption is projected to cost the state about $20 million a year. Kelly McCutchen, president of the Georgia Public Policy Institute, a fiscally conservative think tank, said the Legislature will probably continue both exemptions before they expire because of their popularity with the public. "It took a recession to get rid of the sales tax holiday," he said. Robinson’s claim passed one major political hurdle. The Washington, D.C.-based Americans for Tax Reform has its problems with the bill, specifically that it believes the Internet tax provision is unconstitutional and that the legislation doesn’t go far enough in accomplishing "tax reform." Still, Josh Culling, its state affairs manager, called the bill a "net tax cut," basing that conclusion on the fiscal note. The organization asks political candidates to sign a pledge not to support any legislation that results in a net tax increase. The pledge is virtually a requirement for any fiscal conservative who wants to get in office. Deal has signed the pledge, along with nearly one-quarter of the Georgia Legislature. "While we are not excited about many of the tax changes in the bill, we have informed the Legislature that it is compliant with the Taxpayer Protection Pledge," Culling told us in an email. Alan Essig, executive director of the Georgia Budget & Policy Institute, which constantly monitors fiscal matters at the state Capitol, agreed with Robinson’s statement if you define an overall tax cut as a decline in taxes collected by local and state governments. Speaking about the changes concerning retirement income, McCutchen said "that technically is a tax increase on senior citizens. But I would say [Georgia already has] one of the more generous retirement exclusions in the country." McCutchen, a supporter of the bill, agreed with Robinson’s claim. "Overall, it’s a tax cut, and I don’t think there’s much debate on that," McCutchen said. We’d like to see more years worth of estimates to see how much revenue the state would collect past FY 2015. Some believe the state will see a surplus in revenue if Georgia’s population grows and more people buy cars. They could be right, especially if the sales tax holiday and construction exemption do not continue past FY 2015. Since Robinson’s quote was based solely on the impact to the state, and not to its taxpayers, the current state estimate does back up his claim -- unless the construction exemption and sales tax holiday don’t continue. Based on the current estimates, we rate Robinson’s claim as True.	None	Brian Robinson	None	None	None	2012-03-26T06:00:00	2012-03-21	['None']
pomt-11291	"In Mobile, it’s something like, 1,700 families generate 80 percent of the crime. We know who those families are."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/apr/23/bill-hightower/1700-families-generate-80-percent-crime-mobile-ala/	Alabama state Sen. Bill Hightower raised a few eyebrows during a debate among Republican candidates for governor when he traced a large portion of crime to a small portion of families in Mobile. Joining Hightower at the April 18 debate were Huntsville Mayor Tommy Battle and evangelist Scott Dawson, all of whom are hoping to replace incumbent Gov. Kay Ivey as the Republican nominee after the June 5 primary. Ivey, who stepped into the role after former Gov. Robert Bentley resigned, did not participate in the debate. One AL.com reader asked the candidates, "As the mom of a third grader who had a classmate say he would bring a gun to school, what will you be doing to keep our kids safe?" Hightower proposed placing police officers in schools so that they got to know students and prevent crime. "We know who the difficult students are, more often than not, through their truancy and through their actions," Hightower said. "In Mobile, it’s something like, 1,700 families generate 80 percent of the crime. We know who those families are." Mobile has a population of about 193,000. Is a small fraction of families generating a majority of crime? Not so fast. It sounded like Hightower was talking about the outsized effects of organized crime in Mobile. But Hightower’s campaign told us he was citing a statistic about school suspensions. That statistic is 15 years old and is the latest study available. In 2003, the Mobile County district attorney researched school suspensions and found that of the 65,000 students in the district, only 1,500 students were responsible for 75 to 80 percent of serious school infractions. The district attorney then cross-referenced the students with home addresses to identify 1,200 households. The office did not study all of the reasons for a suspension, just those that were considered serious — such as burglary or having drugs or weapons on campus. John Tyson, the former district attorney who did the research, emphasized the behavior did not constitute crime under a criminal justice definition. Tyson said there is not a similar data point for more recent years. Still, criminologists were not surprised by the finding. "The general idea that a few people are engaged in a lot of problem behavior and criminal behavior makes a lot of sense and would be consistent with what we see with a lot of other types of crime," said Adam Lankford, an associate professor of criminology and criminal justice at the University of Alabama. Sexual assault on campus came to mind, where the number of reported incidents often heavily outweighs the number of offenders. "A small percentage of the population is responsible for a large percentage of crimes. The same is true of families as criminal behavior often runs within families," said James Fox, a criminology professor at Northeastern University. Lankford took issue with Hightower’s description of the role of families. While social factors play a role in problematic behavior, the research identified correlation, not causation. It did not place blame on a small proportion of families for crime. In fact, Tyson warned against using the word "crime" to describe the behavior, as the research looked at addressing school suspensions and absences to address potential future crime, not actual crime. Tyson said the research was not very relevant for his office. But he did use it as a starting point for the ongoing Helping Families Initiative, which he continues to lead. The initiative pairs K-12 public school students who are identified as at-risk for crime with law enforcement and community resources, such as child services, public health officials and domestic violence experts. The aim is to reduce misdemeanors committed on campus and other criminal acts. The program is active in six districts, including Mobile. Our ruling Hightower said, "In Mobile, it’s something like, 1,700 families generate 80 percent of the crime." Hightower’s point is roughly related to available research. But he did not describe it correctly. He oversimplified research findings of the Mobile County District Attorney’s office about school suspensions. The office learned kids from 1,200 households were responsible for 75 to 80 percent of school infractions in Mobile’s public schools. It did not go so far as to examine the role of the families in those households. Also, it’s important to know the research was from 2003, and we don’t know if the percentage still holds up. And importantly, the study centered on school suspensions and not "crime," in a literal or legal sense. Because the statement is partially accurate but missing critical context, we rate this statement Half True.

pomt-11201	Says of MS-13 gang members, "We are getting them out of our country by the thousands."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/15/donald-trump/donald-trump-exaggerates-number-ms-13-gang-members/	In a ceremony honoring law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty, President Donald Trump underlined the threat of MS-13 gang members and his administration’s efforts to deport them. "Recently, MS-13 gang members called for the assassination of New York City police officers so the gang could quote, ‘take back the streets.’ They got it wrong. We are the ones who are taking back the streets. We are getting them out of our country by the thousands," Trump said May 15. "Every week we're setting new records on — we have a ‘catch and release’ program, too. It’s called we catch them and we release them in the country they came back from, we are getting them out. Or we are putting them in prison." There are an estimated 10,000 MS-13 gang members in the United States. Not all are immigrants. Some are U.S. citizens who can’t be deported. Still, we wondered about Trump’s claim that MS-13 gang members are being deported "by the thousands." We found that thousands of gang members have been deported under Trump’s administration. However, it’s unclear how many of them were MS-13 gang members, because U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement does not track removals by specific gang affiliation. An expert who researches gangs and criminal justice said there is a lengthy process between a gang member’s arrest and deportation. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Removals data does not single out MS-13 ICE does not track gang removals by specific gang, but the agency does specifically target MS-13 members for arrest and removal on the basis of their immigration violations, said Matthew Bourke, a spokesman for the agency. Bourke said 5,396 gang members were removed in fiscal year 2017 (which includes about four months of the Obama administration, running from Oct. 1, 2016 through Sept. 30, 2017). From Oct. 1, 2017 through Dec. 16, 2017 (the latest data available), 1,082 gang members were removed. It’s impossible to determine how many of them were MS-13 gang members. There is other data indicating the Trump administration’s efforts to deport MS-13 gang members, but that doesn’t necessarily support Trump’s claim. ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations division arrested nearly 800 MS-13 gang members in fiscal year 2017. ICE’s investigations division arrested 405 MS-13 gang members, Bourke said, citing first-quarter data for fiscal year 2018. "The time it takes to remove a validated gang member can vary depending on whether the alien has started removal proceedings; whether the alien has a final order of removal; or whether the alien has pending criminal charges in a local jurisdiction," Bourke said. It’s unlikely that all of the MS-13 gang members arrested in 2017 were already deported, because of the time required to remove someone after an arrest, said Jorja Leap, an anthropologist and adjunct professor at UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs who researches gangs and criminal justice. "Most members of MS-13 that I know that have been arrested are being held in court pending trial," Leap said. "The process is lengthy." Our ruling Trump said of MS-13 gang members, "We are getting them out of our country by the thousands." It’s difficult to determine how many MS-13 members have been deported under Trump’s administration, because immigration officials don’t break down deportation data by gang affiliation. At least 1,200 MS-13 gang members were arrested from Oct. 1, 2016, through the end of Trump’s first calendar year. The time between an arrest and deportation varies per case, but an expert told us the process is lengthy. Trump’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-12398	Says David Clarke reduced the number of Milwaukee County sheriff's deputies "from about 700 and something to 300 and something."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/may/26/chris-abele/has-tough-crime-sheriff-david-clarke-cut-number-hi/	Has tough-talking Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr., who has apparently landed a post in the administration of President Donald Trump, actually slashed the number of his deputies by half or more? That’s the attack from Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele, the millionaire son of the co-founder of the Boston Scientific medical device company and a political nemesis of Clarke’s. On May 18, 2017, the day after after Clarke announced he would be joining the U.S. Department of Homeland Security as an assistant secretary, Abele was asked on WTMJ radio in Milwaukee what legacy Clarke would leave behind. (Clarke said he would take on his new post in June 2017, but the Trump administration has not confirmed Clarke’s announcement. Two days after Abele’s comments, CNN reported that Clarke plagiarized parts of his master’s thesis. Clarke has denied that accusation, but has said the report could kill his appointment.) Abele, who was once accused by Clarke of having "penis envy," said Clarke’s legacies include reducing the number of deputies "long before I was there from about 700 and something to 300 and something." Given that Clarke, who calls himself "America’s sheriff," has built a reputation on Fox News and elsewhere as being tough on crime, let’s see if Abele’s statement is on point. Sheriff’s role on crime Clarke’s national profile as a favorite of conservatives has risen largely because of his blunt comments on crime, among other topics. In a 2013 interview, he advised citizens, in the context of a home invasion, to "point that barrel center mass and pull the trigger" because "911 is not our best option." But given that all of Milwaukee County is served by city and village police departments, the role of the Sheriff’s Office isn’t on the front line as much in fighting crime. In 2011, we rated Half True a claim by Abele that the sheriff’s office "plays only a limited role as a traditional law enforcement agency." We noted at the time that Abele had proposed with his county budget cutting 240 positions from the sheriff’s office. That underscores an important point in weighing Abele’s claim: It’s the not the sheriff alone who determines how many deputies there will be. In the annual county budget process, the sheriff asks for a certain number of deputies; then the county executive recommends a number as part of an overall county budget proposal; and ultimately a number is authorized when the County Board of Supervisors approves the county budget. The numbers (Note: All of the deputy figures in this article are authorized positions, rather than an actual count of deputies, given that the number fluctuates with retirements, resignations, etc.) With the 2002 budget that Clarke inherited after he was elected, there were 649 deputy positions authorized for the sheriff’s office. In the 2011 budget, the final one before Abele took over as county executive, there were 328 deputy positions. The executive during those years was Wisconsin’s current governor, Republican Scott Walker. So, as far as the numbers go, Abele was high with the first part of his claim but on target with the second part. But the thrust of Abele’s claim is that Clarke reduced the deputy positions. This chart shows the number of deputies Clarke sought with his budget request; the number that were recommended by Walker with his full county budget proposal; and the number that were ultimately authorized in the final budget approved by the County Board. Again, we’re looking at the period before Abele took over as county executive. Year Deputies requested by sheriff Deputies recommended by county executive Deputies authorized by County Board 2003 * 627 625 2004 * 573 593 2005 * 588 588 2006 538 519 519 2007 443 443 475 2008 457 457 457 2009 439 435 435 2010 393 393 393 2011 328 328 328 *Not available The figures, from the county budget office, are incomplete for the first three years. The number of deputies ultimately authorized by the County Board dropped by 37 by 2005, but the figures don’t show whether Clarke requested any reductions. In any case, 2005 was an important year. In that budget, Clarke requested and the County Board approved, changing 200 positions in the county jail from deputies to lower-paid correctional officers. The change was not immediate; as deputies left the jail jobs, they were replaced by correctional officers. Over the next several years, the number of deputies steadily declined. In fact, Clarke requested fewer deputies than he did in the previous year in each year but one between 2006 and 2011 -- when he requested and was authorized 328 deputy positions. So, there were 649 authorized deputy positions when Clarke took office and only 328 by the time Abele took office. That’s a reduction of 321 deputy positions. But the reduction in total force was less, given that 200 of the deputies were jailers who were replaced by correctional officers. Our rating Abele said that before he took over as county executive, Clarke reduced the number of sheriff’s deputies from about 700 to about 300. The sheriff’s office had 649 authorized deputy positions when Clarke took office in 2003 and 328 in 2011, the final county budget before Abele took over. That’s a total reduction of 321. Incomplete county records don’t indicate whether deputy reductions during first three years were requested by Clarke or were simply made by the County Board. But in 2005, he requested and was granted a gradual turnover of 200 positions in the county jail from being deputies to lower-paid correctional officers. So, at least 200 of the 321 deputy reductions were specifically requested by Clarke, although those 200 deputies were jailers who were replaced by lower-paid correctional officers.

pomt-00602	Today, "the United States is the most respected country on Earth."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/03/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-us-today-most-respected-country-/	President Barack Obama expressed pride in how the global image of the United States has improved on his watch during a White House event with fellows of the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative. "People don’t remember -- when I came into office, the United States in world opinion ranked below China and just barely above Russia," Obama said. "And today, once again, the United States is the most respected country on Earth." We wondered whether it was true that the United States today is "the most respected" country on Earth, so we took a closer look. The evidence we found is something of a mixed bag. When we asked the White House for supporting evidence, they pointed us to a periodic survey by Gallup. The most recent Gallup poll, covering 2014 and released April 21, 2015, is based on face-to-face and telephone interviews with approximately 1,000 adults, age 15 and older, in each of more than 130 countries. The Gallup poll asks respondents whether they approve of the leadership of the United States, Germany, the European Union, China and Russia. In 2014, the United States finished first among this group. The median approval rating for the United States was 45 percent. That contrasts with 2008, President George W. Bush’s last year in office, when the U.S. scored 34 percent, trailing Germany, the European Union and China. That year, Russia was a bit lower at 30 percent. The White House added that the Pew Research Center backs up the notion that the country’s image has improved under Obama. "America’s image began to rally in some nations and to soar by the end of the decade following the election of Barack Obama, at least in Europe and parts of Asia and Latin America," Pew wrote in 2014. "After slipping a bit again in the first years of this decade, brand U.S. has stabilized and even recovered in a few nations in 2014." But a different survey we found showed that the United States trailed other countries. Every year, the BBC publishes a survey that asks people for their opinions about a variety of countries’ "influence on the world." The most recent survey was conducted between December 2013 and April 2014. A total of 24,542 people were asked to rate 16 countries and the European Union on whether their influence in the world was "mostly positive" or "mostly negative." The results of the BBC poll placed the United States in the middle of the pack, with a slightly larger number of respondents answering "mostly positive" than "mostly negative." This result ranked the United States behind Germany, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Japan, the European Union and Brazil in positivity, and ahead of China, South Africa, South Korea, India, Russia, Israel, North Korea, Pakistan and Iran. Our ruling Obama said that today, "the United States is the most respected country on Earth." International polling by Gallup has found that, in a reversal from the Bush era, the United States now finishes first compared to a limited group of countries -- Germany, China, Russia and the European Union. But a BBC poll that tested a broader group found the United States finishing in the middle of the pack, behind Germany, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Japan, the European Union and Brazil.

pomt-06819	Says that voter identification laws "keep poor people from voting, minorities from voting, the elderly from voting, students from voting."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2011/aug/10/marcia-fudge/rep-marcia-fudge-says-11-percent-eligible-voters-l/	Editor's note: The claim checked in this PolitiFact Ohio item was updated Aug. 15, 2011, to better address the speaker's underlying point. The change did not affect the overall rating of her statement. You need a photo ID to cash a check at the bank and a driver’s license or passport to get past airport security checkpoints. Annoying though this is, it reassures advocates of state voter-fraud laws that they aren’t being unreasonable to want every voter to show a government-issued photo ID before they can be handed a ballot. It’s not for PolitiFact Ohio to say whether such a requirement, upheld in 2008 by the U.S. Supreme Court in an Indiana case, is necessary or wise. Ohio state legislators have discussed adopting a photo-ID voting law but have not followed through so far. But civil rights groups are concerned about the number of states considering such laws, saying the risk of voter suppression with some citizens being denied the right to vote is far greater than the chance of fraudulent voting that changes an election’s outcome. Democratic U.S. Rep. Marcia Fudge of Warrensville Heights led a news conference with other Democrats and civil rights leaders on July 13 and said: "I think that people don’t understand that across this country, 11 percent of all people eligible to vote do not have a government-issued ID. That’s 21 million people." She went on to say, "I guess they think that we don't understand they're trying to keep poor people from voting, minorities from voting, the elderly from voting, students from voting." Her statements intrigued PolitiFact Ohio. Do more than one in 10 people over age 18 really lack a driver’s license, passport or other form of government identification? Do photo ID laws significantly undermine voting? Fudge’s office said she got the figure from the Brennan Center for Justice, which operates within the New York University School of Law. The Brennan figure has been cited widely and comes from a 2006 survey conducted by an independent polling firm, Opinion Research Corp. Respondents were asked whether they have a current government-issued ID with their photo on it, like a driver’s license or military ID. If they answered yes, they were asked if this photo ID had their current address and current name, as opposed to maiden name. They also were asked if they had a U.S. birth certificate, naturalization papers or passport in a place they could easily get to if they had to show it the next day and whether those documents had their current name. According to the Brennan Center, as many as 11 percent of U.S. citizens — more than 21 million — did not have current government-issued photo identification. This was based on a sample of 987 randomly selected voting-age citizens contacted by telephone. The pollster reported a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points. PolitiFact Ohio readers might remember someone else citing this Brennan Center survey — namely, State Rep. Armond Budish. Budish used it in March to support his statement that "25 percent of voting-age African-Americans do not have the photo ID that this bill would require." PolitiFact Ohio noted that the specific figure that Budish cited had a rather high margin of error — 8 percentage points — because of the smaller subset of voters (African-Americans) polled on this question. That mean’t the actual statistic was probably between 17 and 33 percent. This was among the reasons Budish’s claim was rated Half True. Fudge’s statement included all voters, regardless of race. That’s why the poll question had a much lower margin of error; it was based on a bigger sample. The actual figure could be as high as 13 percent or as low as 9 percent. But is the survey valid? We looked for other data and made some calls to ask. A 2005 report from a federal voting rights commission chaired by former President Jimmy Carter and former Secretary of State James A. Baker said in a footnote that about 12 percent of the United States voting-age population did not have driver’s licenses. The figure came from U.S. Department of Transportation and Census Bureau data. We also found a May 24, 2011, report from Norman Robbins, research director for Northeast Ohio Voter Advocates, that examined driver’s license data specifically in Ohio. The report concluded that 940,000 Ohioans over age 18 lacked driver’s licenses. That’s nearly an 11 percent rate, higher than figures cited by proponents of Ohio voter ID laws. Robbins said in his findings that previous figures were erroneous because they failed to take into account such factors as deceased license holders and Ohioans who had moved out of state but were still in the state license database. Based on these studies, it appeared as if Fudge was in the right range. Yet the more we looked, the more we found that the figures are subject to debate. Susan Myrick, an election analyst at the Civitas Institute in Raleigh, N.C., a conservative group that wants limited government, was dismissive of the figures. She noted that the trial court judge in the Indiana case that went to the Supreme Court called estimates in a similar range "incredible" and "unreliable." That judge, Sarah Evans Barker of the U.S. District Court, was criticizing a study based on Indiana drivers license data, not a national poll. But taking a very basic look at Indiana license data, the judge said the actual figure might be closer to 1 percent. Myrick also pointed to a 2008 study from American University’s Center for Democracy and Election Management. That study asked 2,000 registered voters in three states (Indiana, Maryland and Mississippi) whether they had a driver’s license, passport or military ID. Only 1.2 percent of those surveyed said they lacked these kinds of IDs. "These data suggest that access to IDs and the documents necessary to obtain a valid photo ID, for registered voters, is not a serious problem," the American University study concluded. Note that this study involved people who were already registered to vote. The poor and minorities represent a high percentage who have not registered to vote and those who do not have government IDs, according to legal experts whose work we saw while researching this subject. This presents a chicken-and-egg question: If people do not vote when there is no stringent ID requirement, why not? And would an ID rule even have that big an impact? "It seems clear that the requirement of photo IDs is not an impediment to voting; the problem is that not enough people register, and not all those who register vote," the American University study said. "This was a problem before ID laws, and it remains a problem." About 64 percent of Americas voting-age population turned out in the 2008 presidential election, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. And that was considered a good year by modern historical standards. Based on the American University study, lack of a government ID wasn't what kept the other 36 percent from the polls. Americans are highly mobile, and registering to vote in a new precinct, let alone a new city, takes effort. Campaign tactics and commercials before elections turn people off. The nominating process is so front-loaded that by the time some states hold their primaries, the nominee is all but decided. (Ohio could be a good example of this in 2012.) Numerous studies and even books such as "The Vanishing Voter " have examined the problem. Asked specifically about the 11 percent figure that Fudge and others use, Robert Pastor, director of the American University center and executive director of the Carter-Baker commission, did not dismiss it entirely. But he suggested that claims like this miss the broader context. "The problem is not the voter ID," he said. "The bigger problem in America is that we have relatively low voter participation, and that is in part because we have relatively low voter registration, regardless of the reason. That is true regardless of voter ID." If only 11 percent of the eligible population failed to vote, it would give the country an 89 percent participation rate. This would be extraordinary. So how do we rate Fudges claim? We start with the fact that a number of authorities say her source is credible. Daniel Tokaji, a law professor at Ohio State University, told us that he, too, thinks the Brennan figure "is in the ballpark." He cited another study, "The Disproportionate Impact of Voter ID Laws on the Electorate," done recently by researchers at universities in New Mexico, Arizona and Washington who used national survey data from the 2008 election. From 4,563 respondents, they found that 95 percent of registered white voters said they had current drivers licenses or state-issued photo IDs, while 90 percent of black voters, 89 percent of Latino voters and 86 percent of Asian voters did. But when comparing these voters with specific ID requirements of states like Indiana -- licenses had to be current, and names and addresses on the IDs had to comport with the voter registration records -- the researchers found that the percentage of white voters dropped to 88 percent, and the others to 80 or 81 percent. In other words, the figures change depending on the ID standard and the pool of prospective voters being gauged. In the original version of this PolitiFact Ohio item, we gauged the truthfulness of the statement Fudge made about 11 percent of people eligible to vote not having a photo ID. We rated that statement Half True, partly because the data is five years old. Mainly, though, we rated the statement Half True because Fudge made the statement to emphasize that the photo ID law is a significant impediment to voting. As an impediment, however, the Photo ID law pales compared to apathy. A lot more than 11 percent of eligible voters don't bother to register, let alone vote. But PolitiFact Ohio didn't need to look for Fudge’s underlying meaning in her statement. She flat out said the Photo ID law would be an impediment to voting. That's why we changed the claim we rated in this item. Yes, the Brennan Center figure is widely accepted. And Fudge’s statement sounds and feels accurate to a lot of people, many of them worried that voter ID laws will be too restrictive. But the idea that the Photo ID law would reduce voting ignores an important detail -- that a lot of people just don't vote. When a statement is accurate but leaves out important details needed to understand fully, the Truth-O-Meter has a specific rating: Half True.

pomt-14616	"We have more illegal immigrants here" than we did five years ago.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/31/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-incorrectly-says-illegal-immigrant-pop/	Throughout his Republican presidential campaign, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida has tried to distance himself from his involvement in a 2013 failed bipartisan immigration bill. The legislation has proven to be a liability for Rubio because it contained a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, and some of Rubio’s opponents say his support for the bill is evidence that he’s not tough on immigration. On NBC’s Meet the Press Jan. 31, host Chuck Todd asked Rubio if he regretted being part of the Gang of Eight senators who authored the bill. "Look, I tried to fix the problem," Rubio said, referring to illegal immigration. "This is a real problem. And where are we today? We are worse off today than we were five years ago. We have more illegal immigrants here. We have two unconstitutional executive orders on amnesty. I went to Washington to fix a problem." Our ears perked up when Rubio said there are more illegal immigrants in the United States than there were five years ago, so we decided to check the numbers. We found that the latest available data doesn’t support Rubio’s statement. A July 2015 headline from the Pew Research Center directly counters Rubio that there are more illegal immigrants than five years ago: "Unauthorized immigrant population stable for half a decade." Pew found that the number of illegal immigrants living in the United States has seen very little fluctuation, between 2010 and 2014, the latest five-year period of data available — going from 11.4 million in 2010 to 11.3 million in 2014. The illegal immigrant population peaked at 12.2 million in 2007. (See the chart created by Pew to the left.) The Pew analysis concluded that the illegal immigrant population has been stable the past few years because the number of new immigrants is about equal to the number of those living in the United States who are deported, leave on their own, or die. Pew also found that the number of illegal immigrants from Mexico, in particular, has been on the decline — going from a peak of 6.9 million in 2007 to 5.6 million in 2014. The decline in Mexican immigrants is the primary reason why illegal immigration stopped growing, said Robert Warren, a demographer and senior visiting fellow at the Center for Migration Studies. He pointed us to his own recent research on the subject. The report’s executive summary says illegal immigration is a hot political topic, in part, because people believe it’s on the rise. However, the paper finds that "this belief is mistaken and that, in fact, the undocumented population has been decreasing for more than a half a decade." Warren’s report found that the illegal immigrant population has declined every year for the past five years of available data, landing at about 10.9 million illegal immigrants in 2014, down from 11.7 million in 2010. Why the decline in Mexican immigration? In a prior fact-check, we found that demographic change is possibly the biggest driver. The birth rate in Mexico has fallen steadily since at least 1990. Marc Rosenblum at the Migration Policy Institute said that translates into fewer people coming into the workforce. He said apprehensions at the border strongly suggest that fewer people are trying to sneak into the country. Data from the U.S. Border Patrol show a drop in total apprehensions of about 40 percent since 2009. It used to be border agents stopped around a million people coming in from Mexico per year. Last year, it was about 188,000. More surveillance, stiffer penalties and more barriers at the border have had the intended effect, he said. Other drivers include the hit on the construction industry during the recession. That was a sector that drew many immigrants, and while it has recovered a bit, it is not nearly as robust as it once was. Plus, according to one survey, Mexicans who return to their native country generally find that they make more money than when they left. Our ruling Rubio said, "We have more illegal immigrants here" than we did five years ago. Multiple estimates show that the illegal immigrant population has stabilized, or even decreased, from its peak in 2007 through 2014, the latest available data. According to Pew, the illegal immigrant population was 11.3 million in 2014, down from 11.4 million five years prior in 2010. This is in sharp contrast to dramatic and steady increases throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. There is no evidence to support the idea that the illegal immigrant population has grown in the past five years. We rate Rubio’s claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/754cfa3b-c711-4605-8d67-a919074f1c08	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2016-01-31T15:28:04	2016-01-31	['None']
pomt-04127	Says 31 percent of Texas physicians accept all new Medicaid patients, down from 67 percent in 2000.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2013/jan/08/texas-medical-association/medical-group-says-31-percent-texas-doctors-accept/	New Medicaid patients may struggle to land a Texas physician willing to accept that coverage, a medical group suggests. The Texas Medical Association, whose membership includes nearly 46,000 physicians and medical students, said in a Dec. 7, 2012, tweet: "Only 31% of Texas physicians accept all new #Medicaid patients compared to 67% in 2000." We soon learned the figures, indicating a possible plummet in patient access, traced to doctor surveys, not government or other records. Some 67 percent of the state’s physicians accepted Medicaid at least once during a recent 12-month period, according to the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. Agency spokeswoman Stephanie Goodman told us by email that 34,290 Texas physicians had claims paid by Medicaid in the fiscal year that ran through August 2011. According to the Texas Medical Board, there were nearly 51,000 practicing physicians in the state at about that time. Goodman said she did not have information on the share of physicians not accepting all new Medicaid patients. Brent Annear, a medical association spokesman, guided us to a March 2012 web post by the group stating that 27,917 physicians and medical residents were asked to fill out its online survey and the group fielded 1,139 responses, a 4 percent response rate. The group’s "preliminary findings" document says the respondents were a "representative sample" of all physicians. The survey reached members and non-members, the association’s Donna Kinney, who oversaw the survey, told us by email. The results: 96 percent of responding physicians said they were generally accepting new patients, but only 31 percent said they accept all new Medicaid patients, compared to 42 percent in the group’s 2010 and 2008 surveys. In another 2012 response, 51 percent said they could take on more privately-insured patients in accord with federal health reform, but not more Medicaid patients. The key question lists physician reimbursement methods including private insurance, Medicare and Medicaid. "For patients covered by the following payers," the question says, "does your practice currently (1) accept all new patients, (2) limit new patients that you will accept, or (3) accept no new patients?" In reply, 26 percent said they limit their new Medicaid patients and 44 percent said they decline all new Medicaid patients, compared to 32 percent in 2010. Bexar County physicians were most likely to accept all new Medicaid patients; 47 percent marked that choice. But less than 30 percent of physicians in the counties of Dallas, Tarrant, Harris and Travis, which was at 22 percent, said they accept all new Medicaid patients. In the state’s rural counties, 43 percent said they accept all new Medicaid patients. Annear said by email that physicians have difficulties with Medicaid’s rates and bureaucratic hurdles that delay payments. The rates decreased four times from 2000 to 2011, an association spokeswoman, Pam Udall, said by email, though the state also agreed to a 25-percent boost in funds covering certain physician services provided to children on Medicaid, as part of resolving a lawsuit. We asked Kinney to speculate on why nearly 70 percent of Texas physicians submitted at least one Medicaid claim in a recent year. She said about 60 percent of the state’s physicians--including many specialists in radiology, pathology and anesthesiology--must accept Medicaid to maintain their hospital admitting privileges. Those kinds of doctors would have responded to the survey by saying they limit new Medicaid patients, she said by phone. Wondering if the 2012 results could fairly be compared with the 2000 outcomes, we asked if the question’s wording had changed over the years. Kinney said it had not and also that each sample matches the demographics of physicians statewide--with the exception that fewer surveys are filled out by younger doctors, making for a slight, consistent skew through the years of surveying. For outside perspective, we turned to Florida-based pollster Dave Beattie, who called the survey methodology "standard," and Austin pollster Jeff Smith, who told us by phone that his firm once conducted the survey and that his concern all along has been that in contrast to traditional polls, in which the pollster entirely picks whom to question, respondents to the association survey are self-selected. Results are influenced, he said, by which recipients click through to reply. "This is not a random sample," Smith said, adding: "It’s an imperfect world. You can’t ever have a truly random sample." Kinney said that because the overall survey covers various topics, there is not much self-selection bias in relation to any one question. For a "real-world" take, we ran the 2012 survey result by Austin opthalmologist Michelle Berger, the 2013 president of the Travis County Medical Society, which is affiliated with the medical association. Berger said by phone that the society frequently fields inquiries from individuals newly on Medicaid seeking a doctor. Berger said she stopped accepting new Medicaid patients in her practice because related paperwork proved onerous and government payments, which have not kept up with inflation, were not quickly forthcoming. Then again, she said, doctors who do not accept new Medicaid patients may still provide charity care--the result being that some low-income patients are served even though their doctors do not seek payment. Finally, we circled back to Udall about the group’s tweet not saying that the cited percentages were based only on survey responses. "It is a fact," Udall said by email, since the results reflected a representative sample of physicians. Our ruling The association’s tweet said 31 percent of physicians accept all new Medicaid patients, compared to 67 percent in 2000. These figures were based on poll responses rather than a harder indicator--and the clarification that they came from a poll was missing from the Twitter post. We rate this claim as Mostly True.

pomt-05022	"The state of Ohio has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation right now and is leading the pack in terms of job creation."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2012/jul/16/bill-johnson/bill-johnson-says-ohio/	Jobs are a major concern in Ohio's 6th Congressional District, which stretches along the state's southeast border from Youngstown to the southernmost counties in Appalachia. That means job creation is again a leading campaign issue in the rematch between Rep. Bill Johnson, the incumbent elected in the Republican sweep of 2010, and Charlie Wilson, the Democrat he unseated. Johnson raises the issue when he meets with voters, and he mentioned it in June in one of the telephone town halls he uses to keep in touch with his sprawling district. "I don't know if you realize this or not," he told a caller, "but the state of Ohio has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation right now and is leading the pack in terms of job creation." PolitiFact Ohio was interested because its positive tone seemed to contrast with a comment the congressman said, days later: "We have to put America back to work." We asked his office for supporting sources. In a written statement, Johnson said, "Because I talk to so many people in eastern and southeastern Ohio, I know that we need to make much more progress in job creation." He blamed current economic conditions on what he called "the job-killing policies" of the Obama administration. "I often give dozens of speeches and talks a week, rarely relying on a script," he said. "While my precise wording certainly could have been better, the essence of my point is the same one The Plain Dealer's PolitiFact made just a few months ago." He cited PolitiFact Ohio's fact check of April 5, on Gov. John Kasich's statement that Ohio was "the No. 1 job creator in America in February, and we are now the No. 4 job creator in the last year." We rated that statement as True. But statistics are volatile. Kasich’s statement relied on job figures from several months before Johnson’s claim in his teleconference, so we checked the numbers again to see if it still holds up. In discussing job creation, Kasich pointed to employment data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and to the news release issued by the BLS when it posted new numbers on March 30. In February, the BLS said, the nation's largest over-the-month increase in employment and "largest statistically significant" job gain occurred in Ohio, which was up 28,300 jobs. That was then. In March, Ohio went from first to worst by losing 5,200 jobs, the country’s "largest over-the-month decrease in employment," according to the BLS. Another 2,000 jobs were lost in April. Figures for May, which the BLS reported 10 days after Johnson spoke, showed that Ohio posted a gain of 19,600 jobs -- an increase second only to California's for the month. A BLS economist told us that "lots of things can happen other than the economy" to affect job losses and gains over short period. They don't consider a one-month change significant, but prefer to look at longer trends -- such as Ohio's ranking 4th in job creation over a year. We also looked at the state-by-state unemployment figures from BLS to see if Ohio does have "one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation." The most recent BLS figures, for May, were released on June 15. They put Ohio's unemployment rate at 7.3 percent -- tied for 24th place with Arkansas and Missouri. The figures for April, which were the latest available when Johnson spoke, had Ohio and Pennsylvania tied for 28th place with unemployment rates of 7.4 percent. The latest unemployment rate was lowest in North Dakota, at 3 percent, and highest in Nevada, 11.6 percent. At 24th or 28th, Ohio ranks in the middle, not among the lowest. Ohio's rate has been on a downward trend and is below the national jobless rate of 8.2 percent. It also is lower than the rates in neighboring Michigan and Indiana, and lower than those of such large industrialized states as New York and Illinois. What does it add up to? Johnson conceded that his "precise wording certainly could have been better," and we agree. His statement contains an element of truth. While Ohio is not "leading the pack" in job creation, it does rank among the top dogs in the longer-term measurement that Labor Department economists see as statistically significant. But the statement ignores some critical facts. Johnson cited job creation numbers from February, a month in which Ohio was tops in the nation. But monthly stats for March and April, both available at the time of his statement, showed Ohio losing jobs. And while Ohio’s jobless rate has improved considerably since it rose above 10 percent in 2009 and 2010, it is not one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation. It now is below the national average. But now and at the time of Johnson’s claim, the state was in the middle of the pack. On the Truth-O-Meter, Johnson’s claim rates Mostly False.

pomt-10220	"My grandfather came home from ... (World War II) exhausted from the burdens he had borne, and died the next day."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/05/john-mccain/history-notes-elder-mccains-passing/	In his acceptance speech to the Republican National Convention in St. Paul, Minn., presidential nominee John McCain made the case for the presidency, describing his policy positions and contrasting himself to Democratic nominee Barack Obama. He also discussed his life story as a former prisoner of war in Vietnam, and his family's long history of military service. "When I was 5 years old, a car pulled up in front of our house," McCain said. "A Navy officer rolled down the window, and shouted at my father that the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor. I rarely saw my father again for four years. My grandfather came home from that same war exhausted from the burdens he had borne, and died the next day. In Vietnam, where I formed the closest friendships of my life, some of those friends never came home with me. I hate war. It is terrible beyond imagination." McCain writes extensively about the grandfather — they share the same name, John Sidney McCain — in his memoir Faith of My Fathers . The senior McCain served in the Navy in the Pacific theater during World War II, most notably as commander of the Second Fast Carrier Force and Task Force 38. He was present at the formal signing of the Japanese surrender on the USS Missouri on Sept. 2, 1945. In his memoir, Sen. McCain recounted that his grandfather was eager to get home after the war ended and didn't want to stay for the ceremony: " 'I don't give a damn about seeing the surrender,' my grandfather told (Admiral William) Halsey. 'I want to get the hell out of here.' To which Halsey replied, 'Maybe you do, but you're not going. You were commanding this task force when the war ended, and I'm making sure history gets it straight.' In his memoir, Halsey described my grandfather 'cursing and sputtering' as he returned to his flagship." The senior McCain returned home soon afterward to his wife in California. The day after his return, his wife hosted a small homecoming party for him. "In the middle of the celebration my grandfather turned to my grandmother, announced that he felt ill, and then collapsed," McCain wrote. "He was sixty one years old. He had fought his war and died. His Navy physician attributed his fatal heart attack to 'complete fatigue resulting from the strain of the last months of combat.' " His obituary ran on the front page of the New York Times , and includes the detail that he had returned home only the day before. "Admiral McCain's groups were called the world's most powerful task force and the destruction they wrought on Japanese military installations and armament centers played a vital role in reducing the country's ability to fight and bringing about final victory," according to the obituary. We find McCain's statement that his grandfather died the day after returning from World War II to be True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-09-05T00:00:00	2008-09-04	['None']
pomt-08719	Says Rick Perry is a 25-year incumbent.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2010/sep/03/bill-white/bill-white-says-perry-25-year-incumbent/	The major gubernatorial candidates seem to get their kicks out of plastering each other with derogatory labels. In Gov. Rick Perry's campaign statements, his Democratic rival is "liberal trial lawyer Bill White." To White's campaign, the GOP governor is "part-time Perry." Another White tactic: bringing attention to Perry's many years as an elected official by calling him a "career politician." Perhaps in that spirit, a Wednesday press release from White linking Perry and a widely expected state budget shortfall pokes at Perry's longevity in an eye-catching secondary headline: "25 year incumbent focuses on re-election instead of issues." White spokeswoman Katy Bacon told us in an e-mail that the Wednesday reference was to Perry's time "in one office or another." Indeed, Perry's biography on his state website says his "political career started in 1985." That's the year after he was elected as a Democrat to the Texas House of Representatives from a West Texas district. He served three two-year terms, switching to the Republican Party in 1989. (When we peeked earlier this week, the Perry bio on his campaign website said he spent four terms in the House, but his campaign spokeswoman, Catherine Frazier, acknowledged that the correct number is three. The bio has since been corrected.) Perry won election in 1990 as Texas agriculture commissioner, a statewide office he held for two four-year terms. By the end of 1998, Perry had spent 14 years in public office. That year, he won the race for lieutenant governor, and in late 2000, he ascended to the state's highest office when George W. Bush left the governorship to prepare for his swearing-in as president. Perry won re-election to the governor's office in 2002 and 2006. The tally: As of January 2010, Perry had been in one office or another more than 25 years. Then again, White's headline could be taken to mean Perry has been governor all those years, especially because the related press release and video are about his performance as governor. We think that's misleading. Also questionable is White's use of the word "incumbent," which implies that Perry was cemented into place a quarter-century ago. According to Webster's New World College Dictionary, an incumbent is "the holder of an office or benefice." In common usage, "incumbent" usually describes someone running for an office that he or she already holds. Bacon said White's campaign was not trying to mislead voters about Perry. "Everyone knows he's been the governor for 10 years," she said. Our call: White's poke accurately tabulates Perry's seven-plus terms in four different offices. But describing Perry as a "25-year incumbent" in a critique focused on his governorship blurs the fact that most of the time Perry's held office, he's not been governor — or in a single elected position. We rate White's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-08695	Lindsey Graham endorsed Charlie Crist for U.S. Senate.	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2010/sep/08/blog-posting/lindsey-graham-endorses-charlie-crist-talk-spreads/	The Twitter feeds started buzzing shortly after 10 a.m. Sept. 8, 2010 -- Republican U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham had endorsed no-party, independent candidate Charlie Crist in the Senate race in Florida. "WOW BIG NEWS," wrote Twitter user KenGPDX. BenRay added, "SCGOP Proxy War in FL. Oh my." That's a reference to South Carolina's other U.S. senator, Jim DeMint, actively supporting Republican nominee Marco Rubio. Other conservatives were quick to criticize Graham. "Respect for Graham plummets to 0," KevinWGlass wrote. "We need to publish the names of the RINO (Republican In Name Only) Republicans who are going along with Obama & Pelosi such as Lindsey Graham," wrote ThorntonB1. Put away the pitchforks, users of Twitter. You've been had. The bogus rumor was started by Amanda Terkel, a senior political reporter for the Huffington Post. Shortly after 10 a.m. she posted to her Twitter account "Lindsey Graham endorses Charlie Crist, says he's 'exactly what the national Republican Party needs.' " She realized she'd made a mistake within five minutes, but not before her message had been seen and reposted by hundreds of others. She quickly tried to stop the news from spreading, firing off a quick succession of Tweets. Terkel was looking at an old press release from when Crist was running for Senate as a Republican. The release was sent out on Sept. 8 by Democratic candidate Kendrick Meek's campaign. The Meek campaign has been resending old Crist releases in recent days to highlight his ties to Republicans. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Terkel's follow-up Tweets: "Scratch my last tweet. Think I was looking at an old press release.

I was wrong. Looking at old release. "@MilesGrant Ignore! I was wrong. Crist" for Senate. But it was dated 5/26/09. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- For the record, we checked with Graham spokesman Kevin Bishop about the endorsement. "This is an 'old' endorsement, pre-Crist leaving the GOP," Bishop said in an e-mail. "Senator Graham is supporting Rubio." Bishop included a helpful timeline explaining Graham's one-time support for Crist. Sen. Lindsey Graham endorsed Gov. Crist on May 18, 2009, when he was a candidate for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate. Fund for America’s Future, Sen. Graham's leadership PAC, made financial contributions to the Crist campaign of $1,000 on June 15, 2009, and $4,000 on Dec. 21, 2009. When Gov. Crist announced that he was no longer a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate, we sent a letter to the treasurer of the Charlie Crist for U.S. Senate campaign asking that the $5,000 be refunded and that Sen. Graham's endorsement be removed from the campaign’s website and literature. Sen. Graham is supporting Republican nominee Marco Rubio in the Florida Senate race. Sen. Graham has co-hosted a Rubio reception in Washington and Fund for America's Future gave the maximum $5,000 contribution to the Rubio campaign in August. Graham endorsed the Republican version of Crist back in 2009, but yanked that support when Crist announced he was leaving the party. The old endorsement came back to haunt Graham, and Crist, on Twitter. But don't be fooled. We rate it Pants on Fire!

pomt-07062	On pay for fired Milwaukee police officers	full flop	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jun/28/alberta-darling/pay-fired-milwaukee-police-officers-Darling-does-/	In the middle of the night on June 2, 2011, the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee took up a surprise budget amendment: pay for fired Milwaukee police officers. It’s a topic lawmakers have addressed twice in three years in the wake of public outrage over the treatment of officers fired for their roles the 2004 Frank Jude beating case. Nine officers were fired for their roles in that incident. Anger mounted as officers were paid by taxpayers while they fought their dismissals. The Legislature first blocked pay for cops charged with serious crimes. Then, lawmakers extended the ban to officers dismissed for lesser infractions, including department rule violations. The amendment, authored by the co-chairs of the committee -- state Sen. Alberta Darling (R-River Hills) and state Rep. Robin Vos (R-Rochester) -- would have rolled back the ban on rule violators, which covers the vast majority of those fired. After pressure from Milwaukee officials, who noted the 2009 police pay change had saved city taxpayers $283,300, Republican Gov. Scott Walker vetoed the provision on June 26, 2011. Among those who urged him to veto it: Darling. Her opponent in a recall election, state Rep. Sandy Pasch (D-Whitefish Bay) called it an "astonishing" flip-flop. Was it? Yes, time again to roll out the Flip-O-Meter. A reminder: It does not examine whether a change in position is a good one from a political or a policy perspective. It just measures whether a person has been consistent. Let’s briefly recap Darling’s position on the question of pay for fired Milwaukee police officers. She was a co-sponsor, along with Vos, of the amendment that was added to the budget June 2, 2011. At the time, Vos claimed the Milwaukee police chief could fire officers for "basically no cause." We rated that claim False. Vos has said his information on the fired police matter came from officials with the Milwaukee Police Association, which has about 1,800 members. Once the amendment was adopted by the committee, and then by the Legislature (with Darling arguing for it on the Senate floor), Milwaukee officials pushed for a veto. Under the system, they said, the amendment would have guaranteed fired officers at least 60 days additional pay and benefits while they appealed. Officers in some cases have stretched out the process much longer. The 2009 police pay change has saved Milwaukee taxpayers $283,300 to date, according to Michael Tobin, executive director of the city's Fire and Police Commission. Since then, eight officers have been fired by Chief Edward Flynn for rule violations. In the course of the discussion, Darling said she changed her mind after looking into the matter in greater depth. Darling said fired cops were treated more fairly than she had been led to believe. Said Darling: "There’s a lot more due process and coordination between the chief and the Fire and Police Commission." Vos has said he will introduce a bill this fall to strip the Milwaukee police chief’s power to fire officers. He said it’s part of an effort to streamline the way cops are treated across the state. Chiefs in other jurisdictions suspend officers, and the local commission determines whether or not to fire them. "I told Robin that he needs to talk with Mr. Tobin," Darling said. "A lot has changed." On June 26, 2011, Walker vetoed the provision when he signed the two-year budget. Darling acknowledged she sought a veto of an amendment she co-sponsored. That’s a Full Flop.

pomt-09352	"An audit of the last census found that over 370,000 people living in Texas were not counted, and our state lost an estimated $1 billion in federal funds as a result."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2010/apr/06/silvestre-reyes/rep-silvestre-reyes-says-census-audit-found-more-3/	Urging constituents to return their filled-out 2010 census surveys to the federal government, U.S Rep. Silvestre Reyes refers to a dramatic blast from the past. The El Paso Democrat states in a March 11 e-mail: “An audit of the last census found that over 370,000 people living in Texas were not counted, and our state lost an estimated $1 billion in federal funds as a result.” Goodness. (And where did that census form disappear to?) Does Reyes get his big numbers right? And if there was an undercount, did it cause Texas to miss out on a big chunk of federal aid? For starters, we found no such audit, and Reyes’ office didn’t provide back-up for his statement. However, a 2001 PriceWaterhouseCoopers study prepared for the U.S. Census Bureau Monitoring Board, an entity that no longer exists, stated that nationally, the 2000 census failed to count some 3.3 million residents, including 373,567 Texas residents. The undercount figures were attributed to the Census Bureau and Eugene Ericksen, a Temple University sociologist. Some perspective: Reyes’ recent e-mail harkens to concerns aired in 2000, especially by Democrats, that without an adjustment the census would fail to account for many residents, mainly racial minorities and renters. The bureau did not adjust its count of the nation’s population. The 2001 report said the undercount could result in a federal funding loss of $4 billion across 31 states (including Texas) and the District of Columbia. It raised the prospect of California and Texas losing the most, $1.5 billion and $1 billion, respectively, from fiscal 2002 to 2012. A press release accompanying the report included this warning from Peter Merrill of PricewaterhouseCoopers' National Economic Consulting group: “Inaccuracies in the census can cause federal funds to be distributed in a way that is not fully consistent with congressional intent. The census undercount not only misallocates funds among jurisdictions, it also causes a net loss to the states of funds from federal entitlement programs. Compounding the problem, many state-funded grant programs to localities also rely on census counts.” Reyes isn't alone in using figures from the 2001 report to argue the importance of participation in the 2010 census. Since last summer, Texas newspapers including the Austin American-Statesman, Dallas Morning News, Fort Worth Star-Telegram and San Antonio Express-News have mentioned figures from the report. Does the report still hold water? Our finding: Like a sunk boat. About two months after the PriceWaterhouseCoopers report came out, the Census Bureau said it would reassess how accurately it had counted the nation's residents in 2000. And in 2003, the bureau announced new estimates for what the 2000 counts for each state should have been. And there was another twist: Instead of undercounting the nation's population, the bureau concluded it had over-counted by about 1.3 million people. David Whitford, chief of the bureau’s Decennial Statistical Studies Division, told us that the bureau ultimately realized that undercounts nationally were more than offset by double-counting of many individuals and other errors. One example: counting students away at college while also recording them as part of their parents' household back home. Some population groups were affected more than others. The bureau said it had overcounted whites, Asians, American Indians on reservations and young children, the Associated Press reported, while many blacks and Hispanics were missed. There was still a small net undercount (by 10,245 people, or .05 percent) in Texas, the bureau said. The census count of Texans should have been 20,862,065, the bureau estimated. Where does this leave the PriceWaterhouseCoopers study? Professor Ericksen told us that by repudiating its initial undercount estimates, the bureau effectively invalidated both the population figures and federal aid estimates. And Merrill of PriceWaterhouseCoopers cautioned against using its 2001 report for another reason: "It is certainly out of date... Our firm is not telling anyone that the analysis done in 2001 is relevant for today." Vincent Perez, Reyes' press secretary, said he's been unable to get the Census Bureau to confirm that it backed off the estimate that more than 370,000 Texas residents weren't counted in the 2000 census. How does Rep. Reyes’ statement stand up? Reyes incorrectly refers to the consultant’s projections as an audit of the census; it was a report. More importantly, Reyes relies -- as have other entities -- on an outdated report based on numbers the Census Bureau has said were flawed. The bureau long ago yanked the statistical rug out from under the claim that more than 370,000 Texas residents were not counted and that Texas stood to miss out on $1 billion in aid as a result. This isn't a close call. We rate Reyes' statement as Pants on Fire.	None	Silvestre Reyes	None	None	None	2010-04-06T16:45:24	2010-03-11	['Texas']
pomt-09995	"There are no similar clips of Newt Gingrich talking about how ineffective President Bush was in trying to control North Korea."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/apr/07/lawrence-odonnell/odonnell-alleges-gingrich-laid-bush-record-indicat/	On a recent episode of MSNBC's Countdown with Keith Olbermann, liberal political analyst Lawrence O'Donnell accused Newt Gingrich of hypocrisy for criticizing President Obama. Gingrich had said on Fox News Sunday on April 5, 2009 that Obama had a "fantasy foreign policy" that emphasized diplomacy despite threats such as that from North Korea. A day later in an online chat the former House speaker said Obama's response to a recent North Korean missile test was "a vivid demonstration of weakness." Olbermann mentioned these criticisms, playing a clip of the first, then turned to O'Donnell for a response. "Well, we don't have similar clips to show from 2006 in October, the last time North Korea launched one of these things under President Bush's watch," said O'Donnell, a former Senate staffer, Huffington Post blogger and executive producer of The West Wing . "There are no similar clips of Newt Gingrich talking about how ineffective President Bush was in trying to control North Korea." "Yes," Olbermann said. We were less willing than Olbermann to take O'Donnell at his word. So we checked what Gingrich said in October 2006, after North Korea announced it had detonated a nuclear device. Here's Gingrich talking about the incident on Hannity & Colmes on Oct. 10, 2006: "We may wake up one morning and lose Seattle or San Francisco or Atlanta or Boston," Gingrich said. "And that's far too serious to just degenerate into pointing fingers at each other. And, yet, I don't sense any -- I don't sense any real willingness, and I say this about both parties. I mean, this would be a great moment for the president to invite all the senior Democrats in the House and Senate into a White House meeting to sit down and say, 'First of all, our analysts were wrong. Second, our intelligence didn't know where to look. We're not even certain the first weapon was a nuclear weapon.' The Japanese now report a second test. I mean, this ought to be seen as a very substantial crisis of national security." "I'm not defending the administration here," Gingrich emphasized later in the program. "This is not a pro-Bush comment. I'm saying I think we, as Americans, are up against much more serious problems than we understand. And that we are faced with a threat that literally could cost us two or three cities in the next decade." Here's Gingrich a week later on The O'Reilly Factor talking about national security: "I think we have to demand dramatically more," Gingrich said. "We may well have to spend more on national security. But the answer is not to become weaker than President Bush. The answer is to become stronger. I'm not at all comfortable, whether it's in Iraq, or in the intelligence service or dealing with North Korea or dealing with our own border. I'm not comfortable with where we are right now." O'Reilly had not even asked specifically about North Korea. Later on the program Gingrich endorsed Bush's decision not to have one-on-one talks with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-il. But still, in the above exchange, Gingrich went out of his way to suggest Bush was too weak with respect to North Korea. So there are at least two instances of Gingrich critiquing Bush's approach to North Korea -- exactly what O'Donnell said did not happen. We find O'Donnell's claim to be False.

pomt-13228	Says Hillary Clinton "wants to have open borders."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/19/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-hillary-clinton-wants-have-open-/	Donald Trump says that Hillary Clinton wants open borders — a charge he has leveled again after an excerpt of one of her speeches leaked in a hacked email. "We have no country if we have no border. Hillary wants to give amnesty," Trump said during the debate held at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas Oct. 19. "She wants to have open borders." Clinton countered that she has supported border security for years and has included it in her presidential immigration plan. That prompted debate moderator Chris Wallace to ask Clinton to explain her remarks about "open borders" to the Brazilian bank Banco Itau in 2013. Here is that excerpt, as released by WikiLeaks: "My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere." At the debate, Clinton replied that her sentence from the speech related to energy. "I was talking about energy. You know, we trade more energy with our neighbors than we trade with the rest of the world combined," she said. "And I do want us to have an electric grid, an energy system that crosses borders. I think that will be great benefit to us." Trump shook his head, countering again: "She wants open borders. People are going to pour into our country." We will fact-check whether Clinton is for open borders. Open borders At a rally in Pennsylvania earlier this month, Trump made a similar claim, that Clinton had made a "radical call for open borders, meaning anyone in the world can enter the United States without any limit at all." We rated his claim Mostly False. The Trump campaign referred us to Clinton's pledge to offer immigration legislation within her first 100 days in office and to help Dreamers, children brought to the United States illegally as children. But that doesn’t amount to wanting open borders. Clinton supported 2013 legislation (which never passed) that included a path to citizenship with conditions and billions for border enforcement for new surveillance equipment and fencing along the Mexican border, as well as adding 20,000 border agents. As a candidate, she has said she would focus on deportations for violent criminals or those who pose threats. Some experts disagree about what "open borders" means. Steven Camarota, a spokesman for the Center for Immigration Studies which advocates for low levels of immigration, says her focus on deporting violent criminals is only a small share of the undocumented population. "That can reasonably be seen as open borders since almost all those who join the illegal population will not have to leave, rendering the current restrictions and limits mute," he said. Daniel Costa, director of immigration law and policy research at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, said Clinton hasn’t released enough specifics about her plans such as her position on the future flow of migrant workers. "Positions on these issues would shed a lot of light on whether or not she supports something approaching open borders (although the term open borders can mean many things)," he said. But generally we heard from experts that although Clinton wants to make it easier for many undocumented immigrants to obtain legal status, that’s not the same as getting rid of enforcement entirely and allowing open borders. Bank speech excerpt When WikiLeaks posted Clinton’s speech excerpt about open borders earlier this month, we asked immigration experts if her statement was a call for open borders for immigrants. The experts said Clinton’s remarks were not a clear-cut call for open borders. They also said that her statement sounded aspirational and contained no timeline or explanation as to how she would make it happen politically. (We asked the Clinton campaign for her full speech but did not get a reply to that request, so we can only evaluate the excerpt.) "My guess would be that Clinton's Brazil speech reflects this broader call for greater hemispheric cooperation on a variety of issues, including trade," Stephen Kelly, a Duke University public policy professor. "Given this context, and without seeing the rest of her speech, I would also guess that the ‘open borders’ she mentions relate to the movement of goods and capital, but not people." Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a policy institute focused on foreign policy and national security, said that Clinton seemed to refer to something related to travel such as the Schengen Agreement, which abolished many of the European Union’s internal borders. For example, if the United States and Canada had such an agreement, that would not mean an open border for free immigration, but rather for free travel. "I don't think she is calling for open immigration, but the context of her remarks shows that when she says ‘open borders,’ she doesn't just mean open trade," he said. Jacob Vigdor, professor of public policy and governance at University of Washington, said Clinton appeared to be talking about both trade and immigration. "I would read the remark as calling for open borders with regard to both trade and immigration. Otherwise the term ‘open trade and open borders’ would be redundant," he said. However, he said he saw no timetable in her remarks beyond "some time in the future," or discussion about how to make it happen. "I don't necessarily see a contradiction between a statement of ideals and a more pragmatic policy agenda for reality," he said. "One can dream of a crime-free world where there is need for neither police nor prisons while still supporting those things in reality." Our ruling Trump said that Clinton "wants to have open borders." Although she wants to make it easier for some undocumented immigrants to stay here, she has repeatedly said she supports border security, so Trump is exaggerating when he says she wants open borders. In a brief speech excerpt from 2013, she called for "a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable." Clinton has said she was talking about clean energy, but we can’t fully evaluate her remarks to a bank because we don’t have the full speech.

pomt-08566	Says he took down the mob in Northeast Ohio	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2010/sep/28/tom-ganley/tom-ganley-touts-role-fbi-investigation/	In ads and personal appearances, Brecksville auto dealer Tom Ganley likes to say his 1980s run-in with organized crime is one of the top reasons why voters should support his GOP campaign for Congress over incumbent Copley Township Democratic Rep. Betty Sutton. Ganley’s campaign broadcast its first television ad on Sept. 16, which began: "An organized crime syndicate was extorting money from his business, threatening his family. But he fought back and won the FBI’s highest civilian award. Tom Ganley for Congress. Tom Ganley will take that same courage and business experience to Washington and stop reckless spending." Earlier that week, Ganley told The Plain Dealer’s editorial board that he took down the mob in Northeast Ohio. In the Sept. 13 interview, Ganley described how he spent two years helping the FBI catch organized crime figures who tried to extort money from his car dealership, how he wore a bulletproof vest, how his personal and business phones were monitored, his children were threatened, and how the Mafia put out a $1 million contract on his life. The FBI subsequently gave him its "Louis E. Peters Memorial Service Award." "I’m someone who has taken on the Mafia and won," Ganley told the editorial board. PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look at his claim. Articles from The Plain Dealer’s archives show two organized crime figures -- former Teamsters Union leader John J. (Skip) Felice and Joseph C. Ilaqua -- were sent to prison by U.S. District Judge Alvin I. Krenzler in July 1983 after pleading guilty to conspiring to extort $10,000 and a car from Ganley in 1981 and 1982.. The indictment against Felice said he approached Ganley in April 1981, and told him that high ranking organized crime figures wanted him killed. Felice said he could get the contract on Ganley’s life canceled in exchange for money. Ganley paid Felice $10,000 in two, $5,000 payments on or about May 4, 1981, and Feb. 10, 1982. As part of the deal, Ganley gave Ilaqua a leased 1981 Oldsmobile 98 Regency. "During this investigation, it became evident to these organized crime members that Mr. Ganley was cooperating with the FBI and that he would be testifying against them at trial," says a 2007 press release the FBI issued when Ganley got its Louis E. Peters award. "This realization resulted in additional death threats directed at Mr. Ganley and his family. Mr. Ganley refused to be intimidated by these criminals and consented to having FBI agents live at his residence to provide security for himself and his family." Former FBI agents interviewed by The Plain Dealer said that Ganley wore a wire when he met with the extortionists and asked questions at the FBI’s request that were designed to help it crack other cases. Former FBI agent Carmen LoParo said Felice helped implicate other criminals by answering Ganley’s questions about who ultimately got the extortion money he paid. LoParo described Ilaqua as "a mob strongarm person who would break legs and things." "Skippy Felice was boasting about all the mob connections and how there was money coming in from different organizations in Las Vegas," recalled another retired FBI agent, James Kennedy. "That was eventually used to develop cooperating witnesses within the organized crime family." None of the FBI agents or former federal prosecutors contacted by The Plain Dealer could provide the names of crime figures apart from Felice and Ilaqua who were convicted solely on the basis of Ganley’s evidence. They said the FBI used information from many sources to build cases against organized crime figures. "Every single case was connected to other cases because of this larger structure," says retired FBI agent David Drab. And while he described Ganley’s actions as courageous and important to the FBI’s investigative strategy, he said: "I don’t think anybody would think one person and one case could take out the mob." So where does that leave us? Ganley’s claim to the editorial board does have some element of truth. He did help put several dangerous criminals behind bars. FBI agents who worked with him uniformly praise his actions. But it’s overkill for Ganley to state that his work "took down the mob" in Northeast Ohio. For this reason, PolitiFact rates his claim as Barely True. Comment on this item. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.

pomt-09770	"Health care mandate will require imprisonment and fines for Americans who can’t afford to purchase insurance or pay hefty government penalties."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/29/patients-first/conservative-group-says-youll-be-imprisoned-not-ha/	As the Senate Finance Committee took up its version of health care legislation, conservatives ramped up their opposition to a variety of provisions in the bill. One of them touches two hot buttons for conservatives: taxes and the long arm of the federal government. On Sept. 29, 2009, a subsidiary of the conservative group Americans for Prosperity sent out an e-mail headlined, "Health Care Mandate Will Require Imprisonment and Fines for Americans Who Can’t Afford to Purchase Insurance or Pay Hefty Government Penalties." The group was referring to an exchange in the Senate Finance Committee between Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev., and Joint Committee on Taxation chief of staff Thomas Barthold on Sept. 24, 2009. Both the House and Senate bills would impose taxes designed to prod Americans who are currently uninsured into buying insurance. Exemptions would be provided for families of limited means. The idea is that by expanding the pool of Americans paying for coverage, insurers can use the additional revenue to improve benefits, eliminate barriers for pre-existing conditions and reduce costs for others enrolled in the plans. Initially, the Senate version would have had families above 300 percent of the federal poverty level pay $3,800 a year if they did not have health insurance. Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont., later agreed to lower that amount by half, to $1,900. Backers hope that no American actually pays the tax; they want to see people spending those dollars on health insurance instead. Still, Ensign is among those who balk at the idea. "Some people hold the Constitution pretty high in their lives, and if they believe that this thing is unconstitutional and they then say ... 'I choose not to have health insurance. I'm not going to buy it,'" Ensign said at a markup of the contentious bill. "We could be subjecting those very people ... to fines or the interpretation of a judge potentially all the way up even to imprisonment." The bill summary that the Senate committee considered did not mention specifics about enforcement and sentencing for violations. So, at the markup, Ensign questioned Barthold — the top professional staffer on the joint House-Senate panel that advises both chambers on tax legislation — about what penalties would be assessed. Barthold told him that they would be "penalties under the Internal Revenue Code." Ensign asked for "the maximum penalty" for a "willful" — that is, intentional — violation. Is it "possible that somebody could go to jail over this?" Ensign asked. Barthold answered, "Could be criminal, yes, if it were considered an attempt to defraud." Later, several news outlets reported that Barthold delivered a hand-written note to Ensign after the hearing confirming that violators could be charged with a misdemeanor and could face up to a year in prison or a $25,000 penalty. When PolitiFact contacted the Joint Committee on Taxation to confirm the contents of the letter, a spokeswoman said that such communications were confidential, but she pointed us to Section 7203 of the Internal Revenue Code, titled, "Willful failure to file return, supply information or pay tax." The text of that section appears to jibe with the reported contents of Barthold's note. It says, "Any person required under this title to pay any estimated tax or tax, or required by this title or by regulations made under authority thereof to make a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who willfully fails to pay such estimated tax or tax, make such return, keep such records, or supply such information, at the time or times required by law or regulations, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than $25,000 ($100,000 in the case of a corporation), or imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both, together with the costs of prosecution." (A House Ways and Means Committee spokesman said that the same rules would apply to the House bill.) After the hearing, Patients First, a project of the conservative advocacy group Americans for Prosperity, issued a news release that played up the possibility that people who didn't buy health coverage could end up in prison. The release was headlined, "Health Care Mandate Will Require Imprisonment and Fines for Americans Who Can’t Afford to Purchase Insurance or Pay Hefty Government Penalties," and its first sentence referred to "a draconian health care measure under consideration in Congress that would imprison uninsured Americans who fail to pay a penalty for not buying health insurance." We were struck by the statement that the bill would "require imprisonment and fines" for nonpayment of the tax. Nothing in the Internal Revenue Code suggests that violators would have to go to jail. It's simply one of the possible penalties that could be assessed. When we contacted Eric Novack, the senior fellow in health policy for Patients First and Americans for Health Prosperity who was quoted in the release, he conceded the point. "I would make the case that the headline is hyperbole, but it got people's attention," Novack said. "It is a bit of artistic license. I guess I would agree that it's a bit strongly worded." He added that he believes the news release's larger point stands. Such enforcement of the tax would be "turning people who can't afford health insurance into criminals." The headline would have been correct if it had said the mandate " could require imprisonment or fines." In fact, further down, the text of the release reports more accurately that "under the health care bill outline[d] in the Senate Finance Committee, uninsured Americans who fail to pay a stiff penalty for not purchasing insurance would face up to one year in prison or a $25,000 fine." That part of the release, with its "or," acknowledges that violators would likely face just one of those penalties. And it's worth noting that, as with other violations in which people have refused to pay taxes, sending someone to prison is an extreme measure used as a last resort. First off, as Barthold testified to the committee, the Internal Revenue Service would likely undertake normal collection procedures such as wage garnishments before resorting to a criminal case. Tax lawyers we spoke to said it's possible for an unsuccessful debt collection to be referred to federal criminal prosecutors, though criminal prosecutions more commonly arise from audits. If a nonpayment case with "willful" aspects did make it to the criminal docket, then it still has a long way to go until prison time kicks in. Of the 3,749 criminal investigations initiated by the IRS in fiscal year 2008, the agency recommended 2,785 prosecutions. Of those, 2,547 led to an indictment or criminal information and 2,144 produced convictions. And of those, 1,957 defendants were sentenced to prison, a halfway house or home detention. To put this in perspective, the IRS audited almost 1.4 million tax returns in 2007. That year, the number of confinement sentences was 2,123, meaning that less than two-tenths of 1 percent of audits resulted in prison time. And based on past prosecution trends, it's highly unlikely that someone would be sentenced to prison for a debt as small as $1,900, tax lawyers said. Larry A. Campagna — a Houston-based tax lawyer with the firm Chamberlain, Hrdlicka, White, Williams & Martin and vice chair of the American Bar Association Tax Section's Committee on Civil and Criminal Tax Penalties — said that judges in tax cases use sentencing guidelines based on the size of the financial loss to the government. The chart is complicated — and factors like a guilty plea or help in prosecuting others could reduce the sentence — but he suggested that only a tax conviction involving a sum of higher than $12,500 would give a taxpayer a reasonable probability of going to prison. And prison still wouldn't be likely until someone owed $30,000. Both of these sums are vastly more than the $1,900 unpaid amount envisioned in the Senate Finance bill. Much more common in nonpayment cases are fines. On this point, the critics of the Baucus plan have a point: the $25,000 fine in the plan is unusually high compared to fines for other tax matters involving such a small amount of money. Most fines are calculated as a percentage of the sum owed, at a rate as high as 75 percent if fraud is involved. For a $1,900 nonpayment, the fine would be $1,425 — if prosecutors even bothered to chase a haul that small with criminal charges, something they generally don't. One more hurdle before anyone goes to prison: a likely court battle. "I would have a hard time imagining someone going to jail on the health care issue without the case first going to the Supreme Court to test the constitutional merit of the government forcing everyone to get health insurance," said Steven Street, general manager of the Alexandria, Va., accounting firm Ross & Moncure. So let's recap. It is a significant exaggeration to say that the Baucus bill's "health care mandate will require imprisonment and fines for Americans who can’t afford to purchase insurance or pay hefty government penalties." It won't "require imprisonment and fines" — those are simply two of the options for enforcement, and experts say that neither a prison term nor a fine anywhere near that high is likely to be used. The official responsible for the Patients First release acknowledges that his headline overstated what the Joint Committee on Taxation chief of staff said, but the release does accurately report the penalties in the body of the text. The notion that one could go to prison for not buying insurance is certainly attention-grabbing, but based on past patterns of prosecution, the likelihood of it happening is extremely small. So while the fear seems to us to be overheated, the possibility exists. We rate the statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.

pomt-07598	Wisconsin was embroiled in a "constitutional crisis" brought on by the Democratic senators fleeing the state for Illinois to block Gov. Scott Walker's budget-repair bill.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/mar/24/scott-fitzgerald/wisconsin-senate-majority-leader-scott-fitzgerald-/	When the 14 Democrats in the Wisconsin State Senate left for Illinois on Feb. 17, 2011, they threw a monkey wrench in Gov. Scott Walker’s plans for quick approval of a budget-repair bill. The delay gave unions time to launch a fight against the move to curtail collective bargaining for public employees, which drew tens of thousands of protesters to the Capitol. Their maneuver prompted majority Republicans to try to force their return and amped up national and international attention in the battle against the bill. But did the Democrats’ three-week departure put the state in a "constitutional crisis"? Did the consequences of their actions reach far beyond an effort to put the brakes on a bill they disliked? That was the claim of Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald (R-Juneau), who spent weeks ramping up pressure on the absent Democrats. Their departure meant the 19 Republicans could not act on fiscal matters, since those measures require at least 20 senators to be present. Fitzgerald announced paychecks for the missing senators would be withheld; their staff members were put under the supervision of Republicans; staff access to photocopiers would be restricted; fines of $100 a day would be levied against the missing senators. Finally, on March 3, 2011, the Republicans passed a resolution finding their 14 colleagues to be in contempt of the Senate. And Fitzgerald signed arrest warrants for the missing 14, saying the warrants gave authorities permission to take them into custody, and to use force if necessary. In a March 3 news conference after he signed the warrants, Fitzgerald said that because of the Democrats’ actions: "We’re in a constitutional crisis." In doing so, he framed it all in the big picture: "This is not about a budget-repair bill or about politics," Fitzgerald said. "This is much bigger than that, and the minority party has forced our hand … They are insulting the very fabric of our representative democracy." It was more than a statement of opinion, since the constitutional argument was used as the basis for taking several actions. Fitzgerald’s factual assertion quickly took hold and was repeated by others, including Sen. Alberta Darling (R-River Hills) in an interview with an Illinois newspaper. Even though the immediate issue was resolved when Republicans stripped out aspects of the bill and passed without the Democrats, questions remain about the tactic they used and the impact it had on the statehouse. Some Democrats have not ruled out using the approach again. One, Sen. Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee), argued that leaving the state is merely the equivalent of the filibuster in the U.S. Senate, a claim we rated Barely True. Another, Tim Cullen (D-Janesville), wants to make sure it never happens again. So we decided to dig in. What was the constitutional crisis? The state constitution says lawmakers can be compelled to attend legislative sessions but does not spell out how that can be done. The constitution also says lawmakers can be arrested only for crimes, treason or breach of the peace. The Democrats stalled the process, and said their actions were an effort to delay the budget-repair bill. There was no public indication that they wanted to permanently impede the Legislature’s ability to function. "I went to Illinois to slow down a bill that took away workers' rights," Cullen wrote in an opinion piece that ran in the March 19, 2011, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Cullen has proposed a constitutional amendment that would scrap the three-fifths rule that the Democrats exploited. What’s more, talks were under way to reach a deal on the matter. Emails released by Walker’s office showed that the governor was willing to compromise on some parts of the collective bargaining parts of the bill. The wheels of political give and take were turning behind the scenes. Fitzgerald’s office directed us to Madison attorney James Troupis, hired by the GOP senators to advise them about legal matters after the Democrats left. Troupis said the Democrats created a crisis because their departure meant the Senate couldn’t function. He called it a matter of survival of the Legislature. "If the Legislature cannot continue to function, and its primary job is to legislate, then it has no meaning, no function," Troupis said. "That’s precisely what happened." Troupis compared the situation to a bill passed inspired by the Sept. 11 attacks that spells out how the state would continue to function even if many of its legislative leaders perished. That bill allows the Legislature to meet virtually. An earlier, controversial plan that allowed lawmakers to secretly designate their successors in the case of an emergency died. We asked Troupis: Was the departure of the Democrats a 9-11 type emergency? "Yes," he responded. While it may be similar in that members are missing, it’s also quite different. After all, the 14 were not dead -- just in Illinois -- and in regular contact with GOP leaders, constituents, and, of course, the media. Is that enough? "If the body can’t act, if it’s denied the ability to act, it is no different than throwing somebody in jail and denying them habeas corpus," Troupis said, referring to the right of prisoners to have a prompt court hearing so they can know what charges they face. Said Troupis: The Democrats were "denying them (the Senate) the ability to act and that is a constitutional crisis." He added: "It fundamentally alters the role of the Legislature and in a republic you just can’t do that." If that is allowed to happen Wisconsin would be "no different than fascist regimes throughout the world," Troupis said. Why? The Democrats, Troupis said, jeopardized "the legislative branch of government" and would "give too much power to the executive branch." To some, that will be an ironic point. After all, protesters were claiming Walker was acting like a dictator. But let’s close out the GOP’s case, and start evaluating it. Relying upon that argument, the Senate Republicans voted in favor of holding the Democrats in contempt of the Senate. That move was a step beyond a Senate rule that says that absent members could be summoned to appear when the body was in session. We asked a state constitutional law expert for his take. We talked to him while the Democrats were still away, before the bill was ultimately passed and signed by Walker, though it’s now in judicial limbo. Donald Downs, a University of Wisconsin-Madison political science, journalism and law professor, said the situation had the potential to become a constitutional crisis, but had not reached that point because the Democrats had not been hauled in by law enforcement officials. "The basic aspect of a constitutional crisis is when the legally constituted laws or processes are unable to resolve a matter of great political significance," Downs wrote in an email. "This can be due to the fact that established law is either very unclear on the issue, or non-existent. A crisis can also arise when different branches of government profoundly disagree on what the law requires, and the final resolution (often by courts) remains deeply controversial." He noted if the Democrats were arrested, "there will no doubt be a legal case, and the courts will decide." he said. "Whether this will represent a constitutional ‘crisis’ will depend on how secure the legal reasoning is and how it is received." He noted the situation in Madison was murky and the law unclear about how the situation should be handled. Indeed, few would dispute that. After all, both sides were consulting attorneys on how they could and should proceed. Downs concluded: "The Wisconsin case seems to have elements of a constitutional crisis, though it might be premature to call it that. But in my eye it has the potential to be one." Remember, he said this as the issue was playing out -- and emphasized the potential for a constitutional crisis His assessment contrasts that of Fitzgerald, who said the state was in the midst of a constitutional crisis. Of course, there is another side. Democratic lawyers Lester Pines and Susan Crawford issued their own legal memo, saying the Senate has no authority to have members arrested to compel their attendance. "The Wisconsin Senate’s action today in citing 14 members of its members for contempt for their refusal to attend the Senate’s sessions and to issue warrants for their arrest has no basis in the law of this state." Pines said in an interview that the idea of a constitutional crisis was absurd. "The senators were never going to stay away forever, and everybody knew that," he said. He said the Democrats left after it was apparent that they were being asked to consider a major bill in a very short time window. They saw a draft of the bill on Monday, Feb. 14, and it was scheduled for a committee vote three days later -- the day the Democrats split. "The proposal was to overturn 50 years of employment relations law. That was an extraordinary legislative attempt -- there’s no parallel to that," Pines said. The Democrats wanted to buy time for debate. "They wanted to give the public an opportunity to hear, see and participate in what the Legislature was doing," he said. Pines concluded: "They disrupted the majority party’s strategy. But that’s not a constitutional crisis. That’s democracy." We know how it all played out. The Republicans abruptly called a Senate-Assembly conference committee and narrowed the bill to focus on the collective bargaining provisions and the requirement that workers pay more for pensions and health care. Calling what remained non-fiscal matters, the Senate approved the bill March 9, the Assembly the following day and Walker quickly signed it. To a degree, those actions undermine the GOP’s claim that the state was on the verge of a constitutional crisis. Even as Fitzgerald made the claim, Republicans had a means to break the logjam and get key portions of the bill in place. Of course, not everything Walker wanted is in place and the full short-term budget gap has not been closed. If the law takes effect, the pension and health care contributions would mean a projected additional $37 million for the state. The short-term budget gap for the year ending June 30, 2011 is estimated at about $137 million. So, where does that leave us? Fitzgerald argued the absence of the Democrats didn’t create just a political crisis, but put the state into a constitutional crisis. That conjures images of a 9-11 type emergency -- a comparison made by the GOP attorney. But this strikes us as different: The Democrats were talking to their GOP counterparts, and Walker had indicated a willingness to reach a deal for their return. Also, the Democrats were pretty plain in their explanations of their strategy. They were trying to slow down and change Walker’s bill. What’s more, even as Fitzgerald made the statement, he had the tools at his disposal -- the ones the GOP ultimately used -- to break the logjam and get key parts of the bill through. That said, the Legislature was not able to close the short-term budget gap -- and still has not. Had the Democrats stayed away for a longer period of time, and had there been no other tools available, Fitzgerald’s statement would have been closer to accurate. All things considered, we rate Fitzgerald’s claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-09314	"I never had a filibuster-proof Senate."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/18/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-says-he-never-had-filibuster-proof-se/	In an interview with former President Bill Clinton on ABC's This Week on April 18, 2010, host Jake Tapper marveled at the fact that Clinton's first Supreme Court nominee Ruth Bader Ginsburg -- now one of the most liberal members of the court -- was confirmed in the Senate 96 to 3. In fact, Tapper noted, Sen. Orrin Hatch, a senior Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, credited Clinton with bringing him into the consultation process when Ginsburg was chosen. "What advice would you give President Obama?" Tapper asked. "Because Republicans are saying he's not including them in this." Clinton began by explaining that he faced a different political environment. "Well, I think for one thing, I had to do a little more of that (reaching out to Republicans) because I never had a filibuster-proof Senate," Clinton said. "And now there are 41 of them, although I think that a lot of those who come from more progressive states, the two Maine senators, the new senator from Massachusetts, a lot of them may think they already gave it the store on the health care deal or whatever they're doing on financial reform. I think it will be very difficult to just outright block a Supreme Court nominee that's otherwise qualified." With the close votes on health care reform, we have all become a little more familiar with how important political ratios can be to the legislative process. And so we decided to do a little research into Clinton's claim that he never had a filibuster-proof Senate. A filibuster is an attempt by the minority party to try to block a vote on issue. It takes a three-fifths majority (60 out of 100 senators) to invoke cloture and overcome a filibuster. That's why Scott Brown's election to the Senate in Massachusetts was such an important victory for Republicans. It gave Republicans 41 votes, enough to at least threaten a filibuster. When Clinton came into office in 1993, Democrats held the majority in the Senate. But the ratio was not filibuster-proof. Senate records show Republicans held 43 seats when Clinton came into office, and they added another seat in June of that year with the election of Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas. That was the Senate breakdown when Clinton nominated Ginsburg on June 14, 1993, when she was confirmed by a 96-3 vote. And it was the same ratio (56 Democrats to 44 Republicans) when Clinton nominated Stephen Breyer the following year (he was confirmed 87-9). That would be as close as Clinton would ever come to a filibuster-proof Senate. In fact, Republicans won a majority of seats in the Senate in the 1994 elections and retained control of both houses throughout the remainder of Clinton's presidency. The party split resurfaced later in the interview when Tapper asked Clinton a nearly identical question to one Tapper posed a week earlier to Clinton's wife, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who championed the health care reform bill in 1993 and 1994. Both were asked if they felt that because they had "stormed the castle" on health care back in 1993, they had paved the way for for Obama to succeed. Hillary Clinton said she did not feel that way, only that she was delighted it passed and that it was "a long time coming." Bill Clinton said he "absolutely" did feel that way. Clinton said his health plan ultimately failed because, "We couldn't pass it without five or six Republicans. I had an obstacle President Obama didn't have. They had an absolute, clear filibuster number. That is, they had 45 Republican senators. They could have lost four and still defeated me." We note that Democrats at the time were also more fractured on which health care plan to support. But Clinton is right that Republicans opposed his health care bill and clearly held enough seats to attempt a filibuster in the Senate. It never got to that. Still, that is one issue where Clinton had difficulty because he lacked a filibuster-proof majority (whereas Obama did have that advantage, at least for his first year). We find Clinton's statement True.	None	Bill Clinton	None	None	None	2010-04-18T16:45:56	2010-04-18	['None']
pomt-09042	“I have filed every disclosure that has ever been required.”	true	/georgia/statements/2010/jul/05/gail-buckner/financial-disclosure-becomes-issue-democratic-race/	The race for the Democratic nomination for Georgia’s next secretary of state has turned downright ugly. A June 27 debate on Georgia Public Broadcasting between the five Democratic candidates seeking the party’s nomination turned into little more than a prime-time mudslinging. The debate was sponsored by the Atlanta Press Club. State Sen. Gail Buckner (D-Jonesboro) quickly found herself on the defensive when she was accused of not filing a personal financial disclosure report as required by the state Ethics Commission. Challenger Gary Horlacher alleged Buckner had not filed within the seven days required after she qualified to run for statewide office. Buckner, a 18-year veteran of the state Legislature, shot back that she had. Buckner was in the state House of Representatives 16 years and has served two in the state Senate. “I have filed every disclosure that has ever been required,” she said. So who’s right? Horlacher, a metro Atlanta attorney, said Buckner was required to file a personal financial disclosure report within seven days after she qualified to run for secretary of state. But the only disclosure she filed was back in January, before she qualified to run for statewide office. She qualified to run for secretary of state in April. The state Ethics Commission Web site has this to say about the required filing: “A Personal Financial Disclosure Statement covering the period of the preceding calendar year shall be filed no later than the fifteenth day following the date of qualifying as a candidate. Candidates for statewide office file not later than seven days after qualifying for office. Only one Personal Financial Disclosure Statement is required per calendar year.” That seems clear-cut. But not so much in this case, according to Stacey Kalberman, executive secretary for the Ethics Commission. Kalberman said Buckner filed a “statewide form” earlier this year that effectively covers her subsequent decision to run for secretary of state. That fulfills the Ethics Commission’s requirements, Kalberman said. “She filed a statewide form in January, so she’s good,” Kalberman said. A check of the Ethics Commission’s Web site shows Buckner electronically filed the form on Jan. 8 at 8:04 p.m. It lists everything from Buckner’s salary, to the value of her home and vehicles. Horlacher said he still thinks Buckner has violated the letter and intent of the filing requirement. And he vowed not to drop the issue. “I am down to deciding whether to formally request an advisory opinion from the [Ethics] Commission,” he said. “I think the state might be better off just to get clarification on this so it is not repeated.” But as of now, Buckner appears to have done what is required of her. We give her a rating of True on this one.	None	Gail Buckner	None	None	None	2010-07-05T06:00:00	2010-06-27	['None']
pomt-03250	Says President Barack Obama "has taken 92 days of vacation since he was sworn in," compared to 367 for President George W. Bush at the same point in his presidency.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/12/al-sharpton/al-sharpton-defends-obama-family-vacation-saying-g/	As President Barack Obama begins a vacation on Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts, social media and blogs are buzzing with details of Obama’s vacations, past and present. Mark Knoller, the CBS News White House correspondent who is considered the authority on tracking the president’s daily activities, recently tweeted that "no presidential numbers I report stir as much reaction and resentment as vacations -- except one: golf." Obama’s vacation plans have attracted heat from some of his critics, who say the cost of moving the president, his family and his Secret Service protection are an extravagance that taxpayers still stung by the weak economic recovery shouldn’t have to pay for. Obama and his family are reportedly staying at a $7.6 million vacation home of Democratic donor David Schulte. The president’s supporters counter that the unique security concerns for the president mean that he and his family can’t simply head out on the road and plop down at a Motel 6. They add that all presidents have to be accessible for consultation and decisionmaking even if they’re on vacation, and that every occupant of the White House, from both parties, has followed essentially the same procedures for vacations. As the Obamas took off for Martha’s Vineyard, one of their defenders was the Rev. Al Sharpton, who hosts a show on MSNBC. On the Aug. 9. 2013, edition of PoliticsNation, Sharpton said, "We all love summer traditions, fireworks, barbecues, the beach. And we’re seeing the return of a right-wing favorite -- attacking the president’s vacation." Sharpton cut to a clip of Fox News’ Sean Hannity saying that Obama "is living a pretty extravagant lifestyle, isn’t he? Martha's Vineyard, big expensive vacations, Hawaii, while 50 million Americans, Dana, are on food stamps." In reality, Sharpton told viewers, Obama "has taken 92 days of vacation since he was sworn in. How many did President (George W.) Bush take by the same point in his presidency? Three hundred and sixty seven. Yes, more than a full year of vacation." We wondered whether Sharpton was right that Obama’s predecessor took many more vacation days than he has. When we asked MSNBC for the source of Sharpton’s data, a spokeswoman pointed to a story in USA Today. The article says, "At the same point in Bush's presidency, the 43rd president had spent 367 days at his ranch in Crawford, Texas, and his parent's compound at Kennebunkport, Maine, according to a count by CBS News reporter Mark Knoller. Obama, who doesn't own a vacation home, has spent a total of 92 days of his presidency on vacation, according to Knoller." Tweets by Knoller himself back that up. On the eve of Obama’s departure for Martha’s Vineyard, Knoller tweeted that "since taking office, Pres Obama has taken 14 vacation trips spanning all or part of 92 days." Knoller also tweeted that "at the same point in office, Pres. GWBush had made 50 visits to this Texas Ranch totaling all or part of 323 days." Another 26 of Bush’s vacation days are accounted for by trips to Kennebunkport, with 18 days on vacation at miscellaneous locations, according to Knoller’s data. Trips to the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland are not included in either president’s figures. It’s worth noting that there was a difference in the two presidents’ patterns of vacations. As the USA Today article noted, Obama doesn’t own a vacation home, unlike Bush, who owned his ranch. So while Bush essentially used the ranch as as a working White House, Obama has traveled to a variety of destinations, including his native Hawaii. Because of this, the government may have been able to accrue some per-trip cost savings for Bush by going repeatedly to one location. But since the White House is traditionally tight-lipped about costs and security details for presidential travel, it’s impossible to know how the total cost of Bush’s travel compares to Obama’s. Our ruling Sharpton said that Obama "has taken 92 days of vacation since he was sworn in," compared to 367 for President George W. Bush at the same point in his presidency. While this discrepancy is explained by the fact that Bush often worked from a family home in Texas whereas Obama has no equivalent family retreat, Sharpton has correctly cited data from the leading authority, CBS News’ Mark Knoller. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate the statement Mostly True.

Twice. Here's her full quote: "The problem is that if it becomes official instead of recognized as national — which indeed it is, it is our national language — if it becomes official, that means in a place like New York City you can't print ballots in any other language. That means you can't have government pay for translators in hospitals so when somebody comes in with some sort of emergency there's nobody there to help translate what their problem is for the doctor. "So many of us — I did, at least — voted to say that English was our national language, but not the official language because of the legal consequences of that." First, she says that English already is the national language of the United States, a move she says she supported with a vote in the Senate. But her vote was on an amendment for the failed immigration bill of 2007. Congress never has declared English our "national" language. Then she goes on to say more, and she gets that wrong, too. Her claim that making English the nation's "official" (different from "national") language would mean state and local governments could no longer use other languages on ballots or pay for translation services in places such as hospitals doesn't hold up. The non-partisan Congressional Research Service has examined this question several times, most recently in January 2007. It concluded that designating English "official" or "national" would have no practical impact. An official designation alone would not cancel government programs, and although several pieces of legislation now pending in Congress would repeal some federal mandates on things such as non-English ballots, none of the bills would go so far as to prohibit governments from helping non-English speakers as Clinton said. A 2000 presidential executive order, signed by Bill Clinton, makes it federal policy that multilingual services are considered to be among the rights guaranteed in federal civil rights law.

pomt-11611	California’s prisons budget in 1970 "was about 3 percent of the general fund. Now, it’s 8.9 percent, about $12 billion."	true	/california/statements/2018/jan/25/jerry-brown/has-rate-californias-prison-spending-nearly-triple/	Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown reeled off statistics on California’s prison spending during his final State of the State Address after a total of 16 years as governor. Brown, who has followed a federal court order to reduce the state’s prison overcrowding, warned legislators at the state Capitol not to simply pass more crime laws but instead consider a holistic approach to criminal justice. He suggested California has gone too far on prison spending since 1970. "The corrections budget then was about 3 percent of the general fund. Now, it’s 8.9 percent, about $12 billion," Brown said. Was the governor right? Has California’s prison spending nearly tripled as a share of the state’s general fund budget since 1970? We set out on a fact check. Our research California’s 1970-71 fiscal year budget, produced under then Gov. Ronald Reagan, backs up the first part of Brown’s claim. It lists the corrections department as 2.8 percent, or nearly $40 million, of the state’s $1.4 billion general fund budget that year. California's 1970-71 fiscal year budget. Brown’s 2018-19 budget proposal, meanwhile, also supports the claim. It shows the state expects to spend 9 percent, or nearly $12 billion, of its $132 billion general fund on the corrections department. That’s up about $1 billion from prison spending two years ago. Franklin Zimring, a UC Berkeley criminal justice professor, called Brown’s claim about the increased share of prison spending "absolutely true." "California’s prison population exploded from 1980 through the late 1990s and prison building metastasized in the state," Zimring said. "We went from a little over 24,000 prisoners in California prisons to over 170,000 prisoners in 2010 and 2011." Zimring attributed the increase to the state’s booming population during that period, tough sentencing laws, particularly 1994’s Three Strikes law, and the national focus on drug crimes. Fewer inmates, higher costs California has sharply cut its prison population following a 2009 U.S. Supreme Court order for California to reduce prison overcrowding. The population reached a peak of 163,000 inmates in 2006, according to the Public Policy Institute of California. The state estimates it will house an average of about 119,000 prisoners this year. But as the inmate numbers have dropped, state corrections spending has continued to rise. That’s, in part, because California has the highest per capita inmate cost in the nation, at an estimated $80,000 annually for 2018-19, as we examined in a recent fact check. There’s been no corresponding reduction in prison staff as inmate numbers have fallen, causing per capita costs to spike. At the same time, prison staffing costs have increased. Jeffrey Callison, a state prisons spokesman, told us the conditions of the court order prevent California from closing prisons even as the inmate population is reduced. "So long as the order is in effect we cannot close prisons because to do so would reduce our capacity, thereby pushing us back above 137.5 percent" level of prison crowding, Callison said in an email. That level is tied to prison capacity and defined by the court, he said. Our ruling Gov. Jerry Brown recently claimed California’s corrections budget in 1970 was "about 3 percent of the general fund. Now, it’s 8.9 percent, about $12 billion." California’s 1970-71 fiscal year budget supports the first part of Brown’s claim, listing prison system spending as 2.8 percent of that year’s general fund. Brown’s budget proposal for this fiscal year, meanwhile, shows the corrections department is now estimated to be 9 percent of the general fund, or $12 billion. A UC Berkeley criminal justice professor told us the governor’s spending claim rings true, noting the state’s prison population exploded during the 1980s and 1990s, driven by the state’s overall population boom, strict criminal sentencing laws and a national focus on drug crimes. The governor’s numbers are on the mark and there’s nothing significant missing from his statement. We rate Brown’s claim True.

pomt-09834	The Department of Veterans Affairs has "a manual out there telling our veterans stuff like, 'Are you really of value to your community?' You know, encouraging them to commit suicide."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/25/michael-steele/rnc-chairman-michael-steele-says-va-has-manual-enc/	Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele jumped into the so-called VA "death book" debate, calling it just the kind of thing that makes people nervous about the Democrats' health care reform plan. "If you want an example of bad public policy, just look at the situation with our veterans where you have a manual out there telling our veterans stuff like 'Are you really of value to your community?' You know, encouraging them to commit suicide," Steele said in a Fox News interview on Aug. 25, 2009. "I mean, this is crazy coming from the government. And this is exactly what concerns people and puts them in fear of what government-controlled health care will look like." But like the claim about "death panels" in the health care reform bill, we find this is another ridiculous falsehood about an important end-of-life issue. At issue here is a 10-year-old VA-funded pamphlet on end-of-life issues called "Your Life, Your Choices: Planning for Future Medical Decisions." The pamphlet entered the national discussion on health care after President George W. Bush's director of Faith-Based Initiatives, Jim Towey, wrote an op-ed piece for the Wall Street Journal on Aug. 18, 2009, in which he took issue with what he called the "hurry-up-and-die message" of the pamphlet. The issue takes on larger import, of course, due to the heated debate over funding for end-of-life counseling included in the Democrats' health care reform bill. In his op-ed piece, Towey zeroed in on an exercise in the manual designed to "help you think about and express what really matters to you." The worksheet poses a number of scenarios and asks users to finish the phrase "Life like this would be..." by checking options that include "difficult, but acceptable," "worth living, but just barely" and "not worth living." While the scenarios include such things as relying on a feeding tube or breathing machine to keep them alive, Towey notes that it also includes circumstances common among the elderly and disabled such as: living in a nursing home, being in a wheelchair and "cannot seem to shake the blues." "There are also guilt-inducing scenarios such as 'I can no longer contribute to my family's well-being,' 'I am a severe financial burden on my family' and that the vet's situation 'causes severe emotional burden for my family,'" Towey wrote. "This hurry-up-and-die message is clear and unconscionable," Towey concluded. Towey also noted that one of the principle authors of the pamphlet, Dr. Robert Pearlman, was among 42 bioethicists who argued in a 1996 case that physician-assisted suicide should be recognized by the courts as a fundamental right. Worse, he said, is that after the Bush administration shelved the pamphlet in 2007 in order to make revisions, the Obama administration revived it in a July 2009 VA directive that "instructs its primary care physicians to raise advance care planning with all VA patients and to refer them to 'Your Life, Your Choices.' Not just those of advanced age and debilitated condition — all patients. America's 24 million veterans deserve better." We should note that Towey, president of St. Vincent College and founder of the nonprofit Aging with Dignity, years ago created his own advance care planning document called "Five Wishes," and he made an unsuccessful pitch to VA officials in 2007 to have the government buy and distribute his pamphlet. In his op-ed, Towey says that unlike the VA's document, his "does not contain the standard bias to withdraw or withhold medical care." In response, the Obama administration's veterans agency issued a fact sheet to the Plum Line's Greg Sargent on Aug. 25 in which they state that the "Your Life, Your Choices" pamphlet, developed by the VA more than 10 years ago, "helps veterans consider the types of health care they would want to receive if they were unable to make decisions for themselves, and encourages them to discuss their views with their loved ones and their health care providers, and, if they so desire, to complete an advance directive." The pamphlet "does not promote limitation of life-sustaining treatment, assisted suicide, or euthanasia," the fact sheet states. However, the VA did acknowledge in November 2007 that although "clear in its presentation," it has been "interpreted by some to be too negative in tone and not sufficiently sensitive to the perspectives of veterans with prolife perspectives and veterans living with lifelong disabling conditions." At that point, the VA officially suspended use of "Your Life, Your Choices" pending review by an expert panel, including input from faith-based groups as well as disability experts. The pamphlet is currently undergoing final revisions before being posted online, which is set for the spring 2010. But the pamphlet is still posted on the VA Web site, albeit with a disclaimer that it is undergoing revisions. And a July 2, 2009, memo on Advance Care Planning and Management of Advance Directives states that when patients request additional information about advance directives, "Patients may be directed to the exercises in 'Your Life, Your Choices' or other published resources." According to the White House fact sheet, the pamphlet is still officially suspended, but is available on the Web site because, "it is the official policy of the Obama administration not to suppress or alter information or products resulting from federal research grants." Whether the pamphlet should continue to be made available pending its revision is a matter for political debate. Here, however, we are focusing on Steele's claim that the manual encourages veterans to commit suicide. After reading the 51-page pamphlet, we conclude unequivocally that it does not. Rather, the pamphlet encourages vets to think about the kind of advanced care they'd like to receive in various situations, to communicate those wishes to loved ones, and to formally put them into writing (including steps on how to prepare a personalized living will). Alongside positions such as "I believe there are some situations in which I would not want treatments to keep me alive" is the position, "My life should be prolonged as long as it can, no matter what its quality, and using any means possible." The pamphlet also respects that some people may have religious beliefs that come into play. One position is described as "I'd want my religious advisers to be consulted about all medical decisions made on my behalf to make sure they are in keeping with my religious teachings." The document begins like this: "There’s only one person who is truly qualified to tell health care providers how you feel about different kinds of health care issues — and that’s you. But, what if you get sick, or injured so severely that you can’t communicate with your doctors or family members? Have you thought about what kinds of medical care you would want? Do your loved ones and health care providers know your wishes? Many people assume that close family members automatically know what they want. But studies have shown that spouses guess wrong over half the time about what kinds of treatment their husbands or wives would want. You can help assure that your wishes will direct future health care decisions through the process of advance care planning." With regard to the issue of suicide, the pamphlet is quite clear: Q: Can I specify that I want assisted suicide in my directive? A: No. Assisted suicide is currently illegal. Advanced care scenarios are upsetting to think about and discuss. And we certainly can see how some might think it's insensitive to disabled or aged veterans to have a pamphlet with an exercise that poses scenarios such as being in a wheelchair or living in a nursing home, and then to even include the option to check a box saying that life like this would be "not worth living." But we think Steele goes way too far and sensationalizes an important issue when he says the pamphlet "encourages (vets) to commit suicide" — particularly when you consider the pamphlet in its entirety. This is a pamphlet intended to encourage vets to make choices about the kind of advanced care they want. And for the record, there is nothing in the manual that tells vets "Are you really of value to your community?" We rule Steele's statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-12931	The Russians "tried to hack the Republican National Committee, and they were unable to break through."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/11/donald-trump/trump-says-russians-were-unable-hack-republican-na/	After months of discounting Russian involvement in the election, President-elect Donald Trump admitted that Russia was behind the campaign hacks and document leaks. "As far as hacking, I think it was Russia," he said at a Jan. 11 press conference from Trump Tower in New York, his first press conference in several months. Government intelligence agents have concluded that Russia tried to influence the presidential election in a way that favored Trump over Hillary Clinton. A leading reason for this conclusion is that Russian actors tried to access accounts belonging to both Democrats and Republicans through cyber intrusion, but they only widely disseminated significant information stolen from the Democrats. At his press conference, Trump said the Democrats could have done a better job protecting themselves, like the Republicans did. The Russians "tried to hack the Republican National Committee, and they were unable to break through," Trump said. Over the past few weeks, there has been some confusion about whether the RNC had been infiltrated in a manner similar to the DNC. So we decided to put Trump’s claim on the Truth-O-Meter. In a Kremlin-directed campaign, online con artists stole, then leaked, emails from Clinton campaign Chair John Podesta and the Democratic National Committee. The emails ended up being posted on WikiLeaks and other online sources. The leaks caused many headaches for the Clinton campaign and led to DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz’s resignation. It’s clear that Russian hackers did infiltrate some Republicans and affiliated groups. The website DC Leaks published about 200 emails related to Republican Party business, as well as the emails of former Secretary of State Colin Powell. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said on CNN that Russian actors compromised his campaign emails. But the claim that the RNC specifically was not hacked is significant because the organization is the core of the national Republican Party structure. The New York Times reported Dec. 9 that the Russians did hack the RNC’s computer systems. But the Wall Street Journal reported Dec. 16 that the RNC hacking attempt was unsuccessful. Both reports were based on anonymous sources. Two government reports about the Russian election interference — published Dec. 29 and Jan. 6 — don’t provide any clarity. The more extensive Jan. 6 report says only: "Russia collected on some Republican-affiliated targets but did not conduct a comparable disclosure campaign." FBI Director James Comey offered the most definitive statements recently, in a Jan. 10 hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee. He explained that the Russian hackers had accessed state-level Republican organizations and candidates, as well as outdated email domains associated with the RNC, but not the active RNC or the Trump campaign. "There was evidence that there was hacking directed at state level organizations, state level campaigns and the RNC, but old domains of the RNC," Comey said. "That is, email domains that they were no longer using, and the information was harvested from there, but it was old stuff. None of that was released. We did not develop any evidence that the Trump campaign or the current RNC was successfully hacked." He added that the methods used to attack the RNC and DNC systems were similar. The Russian actors used a technique called phishing, meaning the cyber intruders sent emails designed to trick the recipient into clicking a link and giving over his or her email password. But Comey said the Russian attackers "got far deeper and wider into" the DNC, though he couldn’t say why they didn’t get into the current RNC system. Trump and other Republican leaders say that the hackers were unable to get into the RNC because of the organization’s superior cyber defenses. While this is a plausible claim, we are unable to independently corroborate it. The RNC pointed us to the December Wall Street Journal article mentioned previously, which reported that "intruders failed to get past security defenses on the RNC’s computer networks." Additionally, the cyber intruders were much less aggressive in their attempts to penetrate the RNC than they were in their attacks against the DNC. This article is based on unnamed sources said to be close to the RNC and the intelligence investigation. The DNC, in contrast, did not have the most-advanced programs for detecting suspicious email traffic installed, and the organization was slow to respond to the FBI’s warning that it had been hacked, reported the New York Times, in an article based on interviews with several on-the-record sources. Our ruling Trump said the Russians "tried to hack the Republican National Committee, and they were unable to break through." While Russians were able to get into the email accounts of some Republican individuals and state-level Republican organizations, they did not break into the Republican National Committee’s current system, according to the director of the FBI. Russians did access email domains associated with the RNC that were no longer in use, but the information was outdated and wasn’t released. Additionally, it’s not completely clear why hackers were unable to get into the current RNC. The gist of Trump’s claim is correct, but it’s important to keep in mind that Russian hackers did access some Republican data, including the outdated RNC account. So we rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-04024	Says ending the direct payment farm subsidy program "could save up to $28.4 billion over ten years that could be used to reduce the deficit."	true	/oregon/statements/2013/feb/01/earl-blumenauer/rep-earl-blumenauer-says-cutting-direct-subsidies-/	With Congress’ tendency to sidestep the really difficult questions on spending and deficits, even old statements remain relevant and worthy of examination. That’s what happens when the country is governed in two-month increments. So once again Congress is sweating mandatory, across-the-board spending cuts called "the sequester" unless they are able to intervene between now and March 1. And yes, the matter was supposed to be settled. It remains because Congress enacted only a temporary fix. So for PolitiFact fact checkers everywhere, we express our bemused but sincere thanks for the budgetary gift that keeps on giving. It’s also the reason a statement Rep. Earl Blumenauer made in December is still relevant as Congress looks at ways to avoid $109 billion in automatic spending cuts that begin in March. "This is why I've worked to end the wasteful direct payment farm subsidy program that funnels payments to large corporate agribusinesses. This action could save up to $28.4 billion over ten years that could be used to reduce the deficit," the Oregon Democrat said in a Dec. 21, 2012, news release. That’s a lot of money at a time when Congress is desperate for big numbers. But is the number real? Let’s take a look. Trimming back or totally eliminating farm subsidies is one of the most popular ideas for cutting federal spending. President Barack Obama called for eliminating them in 2011, at a savings of $5 billion a year. Blumenauer has long been one of the most outspoken critics of the payments that provide federal dollars to recipients. The payments pour forth, according to the taxpayer watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense, "regardless of current crop prices, and there’s not even a requirement these crops actually be grown on the land receiving payments." It’s time to change, Blumenauer says, especially now when farm incomes are near record highs and the blunt, inefficient nature of the subsidies qualifies even rich "city slickers" such as investment CEO Charles Schwab for payments. It’s not isolated. Five hundred fifty-one people with Portland addresses collected farm subsidies totaling $2.8 million in 2010, the Environmental Working Group found using federal records. Those recipients are part of an agriculture "safety net" erected in 1996 that, in this case, provides payments to farmers (both genuine and hobby) who raise wheat, corn, rice, soybeans, cotton and peanuts. The Congressional Budget Office calculated that ending those subsidies would save $28.4 billion over 10 years. Blumenauer wants that money diverted from what he says are stable and profitable companies to paying down the nation’s $1.1 trillion deficit. The politics are jumbled since legislation that would trim direct payments passed the Senate last year but never came to a vote in the House. But the number is solid. It was generated by the Congressional Budget Office at the request of then-Rep. (and now Sen.) Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., who introduced legislation in 2011 to eliminate direct payments to farmers. If you need help breaking the code, direct payments are federal payments made to qualifying producers "paid at a set rate every year regardless of conditions." The merits of the program can be debated and the politics will remain tangled. But just as farmers return to the field every spring and seeds sprout into crops by summer, Blumenauer’s numbers are certain and correct. For that reason, we are this claim: True.

pomt-14462	"For every time the state gets paid a dollar in taxes (on gambling), somebody loses $6."	half-true	/florida/statements/2016/mar/03/charles-van-zant/gamblers-lose-6-every-1-florida-gets-rep-van-zant-/	While the Senate signaled its gambling bills were all but dead this year, they’ve stayed on life support in the House. But one lawmaker wanted his fellow representatives to remember gaming revenues come at a high price. Rep. Charles Van Zant, R-Keystone Heights, said lawmakers should remember that all gaming revenue is money someone has lost. "Every time you lose a dollar at gaming, there's six more dollars that are lost," Van Zant said during a Feb. 29, 2016, meeting of the House Finance and Tax Committee. "For every time the state gets paid a dollar in taxes, somebody loses $6, is another way of saying that." Van Zant was speaking against HB 7109, a wide-ranging gaming bill that in part allowed for the ratification of the contentious gaming compact the Seminole Tribe of Florida negotiated with Gov. Rick Scott in 2015. The bill also included all sorts of provisions for pari-mutuels, licenses and permits, care of racing greyhounds, and more. While the measure passed and was reported favorably to the House, the Senate postponed its own gambling bills March 1. Barring some extraordinary procedural move, the Senate measure is likely tabled for the rest of the session, which ends March 11. That means the new compact likely won’t be ratified. Van Zant opposes gambling in general, so his point of view is that any gambling revenue, whether for the state or a casino or track, is all money taken from people who have placed a bet of some form. We’re not going to focus on his moral objections, but we were curious whether people lose six times what the state gets in taxes from gaming. It turns out that it depends on what kind of gambling you’re talking about. Gambling revenues Van Zant was not specific in the hearing about what form of gambling he meant, but his office referred us to a 2005 report in the National Tax Journal about state and local government taxes on casinos nationwide. "The American Gaming Association (2004) reports that 443 commercial casinos in 11 states generated more than $27 billion in gross gaming revenue in 2003," the report read. "State and local governments derived $4.32 billion in direct gaming taxes from this economic activity, or about 16 percent of gross gaming revenue." That 16 percent rounds to $1 of state revenue for every $6 gamblers spend, Van Zant’s office said. Those numbers are more than a decade old, so we looked up a more current snapshot. The American Gaming Association in 2014 said casino gaming revenues (from gambling, not hotel rooms or drinks or some such) were $67 billion, and casinos paid out $10 billion in state and local taxes. So more recently, the nationwide figure rounds up to almost 7 to 1. But applying that logic to Florida’s gambling environment is difficult, at best. It would have helped if Van Zant had been more specific, because Florida has several forms of gambling. There are cardrooms, where people play poker and other games; pari-mutuels, which are essentially horse and dog racing; slot machines; lotteries; and Indian-owned casinos. The state gets a cut of all these forms of gambling, but the percentage varies depending on the game. For example, cardrooms are taxed at 10 percent. The slot machine tax rate, meanwhile, is 35 percent. There are various fees and permits and other charges involved, too. "I think the national statistic stands on its own merit, but it is problematic to apply it to Florida’s specific tax and revenue-sharing structure related to legal gambling," state economist Amy Baker from the Florida Office of Economic and Demographic Research told us. "The gaming taxes are all on different bases and aren’t designed to be functionally equivalent." She added the state hadn’t done a comprehensive revenue analysis across all forms of gambling combined, but it wouldn’t be a fast or simple calculation. To even try to make a direct comparison to Van Zant’s stat, we could look at only casino revenue. Seven of Florida’s eight casinos — which share revenue with the state — are owned by the Seminole Tribe. The state’s cut of casino revenue is spelled out in the Tribe’s compact, a business agreement that sovereign Indian tribes must enter into with their home states in order to run casinos on their land. (This is the agreement the Tribe wants the Legislature to renew with some new provisions.) The state is technically not allowed to tax the Tribe, because that’s against federal law. But the compact allows the state to agree with the Tribe to get money via "revenue sharing." Under terms of the compact that expired last year, the Seminoles agreed to share gaming revenues with the state based on tiers: The Tribe would pay 12 percent of net revenue up to $2 billion, 15 percent of revenue between $2 billion and $3 billion, and so on. Some of that revenue was guaranteed, while the rest depends on how well the casinos did in a given year. Calculating net revenue can get pretty complicated, but the shorthand version is that the state said the effective cut those casinos gave the state was 12.24 percent in 2015. That ratio comes out to about 8 to 1 — in effect, people gamble away $8 for every $1 the state gets, using Van Zant’s reasoning. That’s more than the 6 to 1 ratio he cited, but again, that’s just casino dollars. As we’ve noted, other forms of gambling bring in more taxes per dollar, some less. We also should point out that the vast majority of this money is what economists refer to as "cannibalized." That is, it’s money coming from people already in the state who gamble instead of spending that money elsewhere. Our ruling Van Zant said, "For every time the state gets paid a dollar in taxes, somebody loses $6." His argument is that the taxes states receive from gaming revenue is money other people have lost while gambling. Van Zant was using nationwide figures from 2005 for the amount of tax money state and local governments received from casinos. That ratio changed to about 7 to 1 by 2014. But that comparison is tough to apply to Florida. The state has more forms of gambling than just casinos, and the state gets money from all of them in different ways and at different rates.

pomt-11514	"Forty percent of the guns in this country are sold without any background checks."	false	/florida/statements/2018/feb/20/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-repeats-false-claim-about-backgroun/	Like many other politicians before him, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., repeated a false claim that 40 percent of guns are sold without a background checks. "We have to end the absurdity of the gun show loophole," Sanders said Feb. 18 on NBC’s Meet the Press. "Forty percent of the guns in this country are sold without any background checks." Three years after we first debunked this statistic, it’s still not true. The statistic comes from a 20-year-old study by the National Institute of Justice that looked at gun owners’ responses to a 1994 national survey asking how they got their weapons. The study found that 30 percent to 40 percent of all gun transactions were made through an "off-the-books" transfer in which a background check wasn’t required. The finding has been cited widely by gun control advocates. Former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe earned a Mostly False when he used it, and a Florida gun control advocate earned a False in 2017 after the finding was diminished by new research. The latest research suggests the percentage is almost half of what Sanders cited. The sample size of the 1997 study was very small, with just 251 participants. Furthermore, the statistic stems from survey data that included firearms given as gifts or inheritances, not just sales. This is an important point. When the authors of the NIJ study — Jens Ludwig of the University of Chicago and Philip Cook of Duke University — adjusted the results to include only the guns sold (not given), the number sold without background checks declined to between 14 percent and 22 percent. That statistic more closely resembles the new findings in a relatively new 2017 study. Researchers Matthew Miller, Lisa Hepburn, and Deborah Azrael published a study in the January 2017 edition of the journal Annals of Internal Medicine that was specifically undertaken to update the 1994 data. The researchers asked 1,613 adult gun owners where and when they acquired their last firearm, including whether it was purchased, and whether they had either a background check or were asked to show a firearm license or permit. The answer: 22 percent obtained their gun without a background check. That’s about half of the 40 percent figure that has gained wide currency for more than two decades. In fact, Cook wrote an accompanying editorial in the journal, headlined, "At last, a good estimate of the magnitude of the private-sale loophole for firearms." In it, he wrote, "Even though I bear some credit (or blame) for the earlier estimate, I could not be more pleased to be done with it, given that it is based on data from a survey done more than 20 years ago and that, in any event, never directly asked participants about background checks." "It appears the number he cited may be outdated," Sanders spokesman Josh Miller-Lewis told PolitiFact Florida in an email. "But whether it’s 40 percent or 22 percent of guns being acquired without a background check, millions of Americans still obtain guns without background checks. That's absurd. No one should be allowed to purchase a gun without a vigorous background check." Our ruling Sanders said, "Forty percent of the guns in this country are sold without any background checks." That statistic is outdated. It stems from a 20-year-old survey that has been overtaken by another study that shows that 22 percent of gun buyers obtained their weapons without background checks. That’s just over half the percentage in the zombie claim Sanders cited. We rate this claim False.

pomt-09396	The health care bill will subsidize families of four that make more than $80,000 a year.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/24/orrin-hatch/hatch-says-families-earning-more-80000-could-get-h/	In the many months of debate over health care reform, we don't recall hearing much about how low your income will have to be to qualify for federal health insurance subsidies. But on March 21, 2010, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah -- who, like all congressional Republicans, voted against the Senate version of the Democratic health care bill -- tackled the issue directly. "Do you realize they're going to subsidize families that make over -- families of four that make over $80,000 a year?" Hatch said in an interview on CNN's State of the Union. That struck us as high, so we decided to see if Hatch was right. First, a word about how the subsidies work in the bill, which was signed into law on March 23, 2010. The subsidies will take effect in 2014 and are available to Americans who buy insurance on exchanges, which will be virtual marketplaces for health plans. The exchanges are designed to serve people who do not already have insurance through their employer and who are not covered by a government program such as Medicare or Medicaid. The bill offers two kinds of subsidies to people who buy through the exchange -- one for insurance premiums and one for out-of-pocket medical costs. Under the premium subsidy, the government will pay the difference between the premiums for a designated plan and a set percentage of your income. As for the cost-sharing subsidy, the mechanism is still evolving, but the idea is to reduce the amount that beneficiaries have to shell out for co-pays and other medical expenses. The subsidies will operate on a sliding scale, benefiting those who earn between 133 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level. At the upper end of the range of those who qualify for premium subsidies -- those earning 300 percent to 400 percent of poverty level -- the government will pay whatever amount of the premium that exceeds 9.5 percent of the beneficiary's income. (Those earning less than 133 percent of the poverty level qualify for Medicaid.) Officially, the federal poverty limit for a family of four is $22,050, and 400 percent of that amount would be $88,200. We checked with several health care experts and they confirmed that that would indeed be the top income at which someone could receive subsidies. That means that many people earning the subsidies will actually earn more than the median income for married couple familes -- $73,010. On the other hand, how big $88,200 is depends on where you live. In four states, $88,200 is actually below the median income for a family of four -- in New Jersey ($94,441), Maryland ($94,017), Connecticut ($93,821) and Massachusetts ($89,347). In each of these states, the cost of living is quite a bit higher than the national average, and in many cases these states have health insurance mandates that boost premiums above the national average. By contrast, $88,200 is well above the median income in Arkansas ($52,185), Mississippi ($52,992) and Hatch's state of Utah ($63,586). The bill does not include any mechanism to even out such geographic variations. Another point: Families making $88,200, wherever they are, will have to spend significantly before they see any federal subsidy kick in. The maximum someone would have to pay for health insurance premiums before subsidies kick in is $8,379 (or 9.5 percent times $88,200). For most people, that's a hefty premium. On average, a worker's share of health care premiums at smaller companies (three to 199 employees) that use an HMO for full-family coverage amounted to $5,039 in 2009, according to the annual survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research & Educational Trust. Still, premiums north of $8,000 are conceivable. Costs would be higher for those seeking insurance on the individual market (if coverage can be found), and the price would likely be higher in more expensive states. In the meantime, premiums could be especially steep for older Americans who are not yet 65 -- the age they can enroll in Medicare. "Those aged 64 can be charged up to three times as much as an 18-year-old for the same coverage," said Linda Blumberg, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute. "So families that include older adults could face very high premiums relative to their incomes, even at 400 percent of the poverty level, making it unaffordable for such families to purchase coverage without a subsidy." All of this helps explain the rationale for why a family earning $88,200 might need federal assistance. But it doesn't undermine the validity of Hatch's point. Starting in 2014, the health care bill will indeed "subsidize ... families of four that make over $80,000 a year." So we rate Hatch's statement True.

pomt-12738	Says the proposed Texas Privacy Act "is very different from" North Carolina’s law "in that theirs covers a whole list of things that the Texas Privacy Act does not."	half-true	/texas/statements/2017/mar/02/lois-kolkhorst/lois-kolkhorst-says-texas-bathroom-proposal-very-d/	Opponents of a Texas proposal intended to limit residents to public bathrooms matching the sex on their birth certificate hold out fallout in North Carolina as a warning. After Tar Heel State Republicans reached a bathroom law curbing protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender residents, economic losses, mostly tied to boycotts, quickly added up to as much as $201 million, PolitiFact North Carolina confirmed in May 2016. Those fact-checkers later found Mostly False a claim that the law hadn’t hurt the economy. Jobs and money were sacrificed, though even hundreds of millions of dollars in losses wouldn’t greatly dent the state’s economy. Texas Republicans, including Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, have pooh-poohed economic arguments against the Texas proposal, Senate Bill 6. Patrick otherwise said in a Jan. 11, 2017, Texas Tribune interview: "But let's say there is some economic impact. Are we for sale? Are our values for sale? I don't think so." Patrick and state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, R-Brenham, the proposal’s author, maintained at a Feb. 6, 2017, press conference there’s a meaningful difference between what North Carolina adopted and what they seek. Kolkhorst said: "This bill is very different from the North Carolina bill in that theirs covers a whole list of things that the Texas Privacy Act does not." A month earlier, though, the Texas Association of Business called SB 6 strikingly similar to North Carolina’s HB 2 law. Both "ban transgender people from using public school, university and government building restrooms," TAB said in a press release, "and prohibit municipalities from passing transgender-inclusive public accommodations policies." So, which is it? Kolkhorst’s backup Kolkhorst, asked how she reached her assessment, replied with a statement singling out two elements of North Carolina’s HB 2 missing from SB 6. Specifically, Kolkhorst correctly noted in an email sent by an aide, the Texas proposal has no language affecting worker wages or labor conditions while the North Carolina law does. Also, Kolkhorst said, North Carolina’s law amends the state’s anti-discrimination law to add a bar on discrimination based on a person’s "biological" sex; that section confusingly goes on to say that it doesn’t give anyone the right to sue about violations under state law. Kolkhorst told us this change "prevents local governments from creating a protected class of people other than what the federal law already provides." SB 6, we confirmed, doesn’t have a similar provision. Nearly identical bathroom provisions On the other hand, the bathroom provisions of the Texas legislation and the North Carolina law struck us as similar, both versions preventing public institutions including schools from letting transgender people enter bathrooms of choice. For instance, North Carolina’s law requires local boards of education to "require every multiple-occupancy bathroom or changing facility that is designated for student use to be designated for and used only by students based on their biological sex." Similarly, the Texas legislation directs each school district to adopt a policy "requiring each multiple-occupancy bathroom or changing facility accessible to students that is located in a school or school facility to be designated for and used only by persons based on the person’s biological sex." Also, the North Carolina law and the Texas proposal each says schools aren’t restricted from providing, on request "due to special circumstances," an accommodation including a single-occupancy bathroom or changing facility or the "controlled use" of a faculty bathroom or changing facility. Equality Texas notes other differences We also asked Equality Texas, a group that says it advocates for "full equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Texans," about Kolkhorst’s claim. By email, spokeswoman DeAnne Cuellar provided a spreadsheet showing a provision-by-provision comparison of the two states’ measure. Cuellar noted that both measures apply to public agencies and schools. "The only difference in application is that under SB 6," Cuellar wrote, "a private entity leasing a publicly owned facility (like a stadium) can set its own bathroom and changing room policies while it is occupying the building." We confirmed that contrast. Kolkhorst’s proposal, unlike HB 2, says a private entity renting a public building isn’t subject to the bathroom limit. The Texas proposal states that a state agency or political subdivision may not "require or prohibit" a private entity that leases or contracts to use a building owned or leased by the state or a political subdivision from adopting a policy on the "designation or use of bathroom or changing facilities" in the building. Cuellar suggested another notable distinction, saying the North Carolina law broadly nullifies "LGBT-inclusive municipal nondiscrimination ordinances," while SB 6 limits its restriction to local ordinances that allow transgender residents to enter bathrooms of choice. We confirmed North Carolina’s law contains that all-inclusive restriction: "The General Assembly declares that the regulation of discriminatory practices in places of public accommodation is properly an issue of general, statewide concern," the law says, so the bathroom directives and "other applicable provisions of the General Statutes supersede and preempt any ordinance, regulation, resolution, or policy adopted or imposed by a unit of local government or other political subdivision of the state that regulates or imposes any requirement pertaining to the regulation of discriminatory practices in places of public accommodation." Kolkhorst’s proposal is explicit by barring political subdivisions from adopting or enforcing a measure relating to a private entity designating a bathroom or changing facility for particular persons--or not. Cuellar further told us that SB 6 -- unlike North Carolina’s law, which lacks enforcement provisions -- sets fines that could be levied for violations of the bathrooms mandate. The Texas legislation, we confirmed, says political subdivisions including school districts that violate the law are liable for a per-day fine of $1,000 to $1,500 for the first violation and $10,000 to $10,500 for the second and subsequent violations. On citizen complaint, the proposal says, the state attorney general may sue for payment. Our ruling Kolkhorst said her proposed Texas Privacy Act "is very different from" North Carolina’s law "in that theirs covers a whole list of things that the Texas Privacy Act does not." Both the North Carolina law and the Texas bill mandate policies preventing state and local government entities including public schools from letting transgender residents enter bathrooms of choice. But the Texas proposal lacks North Carolina’s section on wages and it doesn’t have North Carolina’s language barring anyone from going to state court to allege discrimination due to the law. Also unlike HB 2, SB 6 doesn’t unplug all local ordinances pertaining to discriminatory practices in public accommodation. On balance, we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-01780	Brookhaven homeowners pay hundreds of dollars less in property taxes compared with owners of the same-value homes in unincorporated DeKalb County.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2014/jul/28/city-brookhaven/claim-exaggerates-tax-savings/	When Brookhaven became Georgia’s newest city in December 2012, supporters promised a local government closer to residents and their needs. Last month, leaders of the city of 50,000 mailed out a flier to every property owner in the north-central DeKalb County city, touting the "facts" about property taxes there. Two pie charts in the flier show details such as how the city uses its tax collections. But even more specific was a chart listing the hundreds of dollars city homeowners would save on their tax bills compared with their counterparts in unincorporated DeKalb. The chart shows owners of a home worth $200,000 save $260.84 vs. the same home in the county. For a home worth $500,000, the savings are $631.28, according to the chart. Claims of similar tax savings began when Sandy Springs became Georgia’s seventh-largest city overnight in 2005. Brookhaven backers promised in meetings a new city would mean lower taxes and better services. Opponents, meanwhile, have claimed the new cities overstate revenue in their budgets and therefore need to either cull services or raise taxes. Such broad battles are out of our purview for a single fact check. But PolitiFact Georgia thought we’d take the specific tax bill for a ride on the Truth-O-Meter to get at the general idea of whether cities can mean lower tax bills. Brookhaven Mayor J. Max Davis said the city mailed the fliers to address internal division in the city, which was created with 55 percent of the vote. The city had planned to maintain its municipal rate of 2.85 mills for the second year. Several vocal residents, though, correctly argued that the city was effectively raising taxes by not adopting the rollback rate of 2.569 mills. (Adopting the rollback rate ensures governments will raise the same amount of money through taxes, regardless of property values, each year. Even maintaining the same rate can mean higher taxes if an individual’s home value increases). Davis said leaders felt the rollback rate would be premature for the young city. The Brookhaven City Council finally adopted a rate of 2.795 mills in late June. "Our main impetus behind the flier was to educate residents that we were not raising taxes, that they still save money from being in the city," Davis said. Brookhaven property owners with a homestead exemption qualify for the city’s assessment freeze, which will hold the value steady on the city portion of taxes. But that doesn’t address the more complex issue of county taxes. And that picture is plenty complicated in DeKalb, one of only two counties in the state where voters have approved the homestead option sales tax, or HOST, to offset property taxes. As long as buying is up, and values don’t explode, DeKalb then has the cash from sales tax revenue to offset about half of the county millage rate, which remains 21.21 in the unincorporated county. This year, the HOST credit will reduce county taxes on a home by about 58 percent. The chart that appeared in Brookhaven’s flier came from internal working documents, which estimated the HOST credit would be about 45 percent. The higher HOST credit means much lower county taxes. That disproportionately benefits homeowners in unincorporated DeKalb, who get the credit on a bigger part of their tax bill since they do not pay city taxes. That closes the gap between the tax bill for the same-value home in the city and county. But Brookhaven’s chart is also missing the 1.67 mill tax that residents of unincorporated DeKalb pay to cover the debt of new parks and libraries. Brookhaven residents must still pay that debt, since they were part of unincorporated DeKalb when the money was borrowed. Brookhaven’s finance director, Bonnie Kline, acknowledges missing the park/library debt in her calculations. Adding that cost – which does not qualify for any HOST credit – further narrows the gap between homes in the city and county. Based on millage rates alone, a homeowner with property valued at $200,000 in Brookhaven would save $58.52, assuming both a frozen assessment and homestead exemption. The tax bill for a home worth $500,000 would be $110.93 lower. Add in the fact that Brookhaven residents pay $12 more in stormwater fees than those in unincorporated DeKalb, and the final savings is less than $50 and $100, respectively, DeKalb Deputy Tax Commissioner Robert Goodman said. "On the face of it, to say your property tax bill will be lower in Brookhaven is correct, but not nearly by the amounts stated," Goodman said. Brookhaven claimed very specific savings, to the tune of hundreds of dollars, to residents on their tax bills in a recent flier. The premise of savings is accurate, but the numbers are off significantly. We rate the claim Half True.	None	Brookhaven	None	None	None	2014-07-28T00:00:00	2014-07-21	['None']
pomt-06673	"Issue 2 makes it illegal for us to negotiate for enough firefighters to do the job."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/sep/09/we-are-ohio/we-are-ohio-ad-says-issue-2-would-bar-negotiations/	The first TV commercial about the Issue 2 ballot war recently hit the airwaves. It features a firefighter talking about how his job will be more dangerous if the issue passes. Issue 2 is the voter referendum on Senate Bill 5, the Republican-backed law passed earlier this year that restricts the collective bargaining power of Ohio’s public unions. If voters reject the issue on Nov. 8, SB 5 is overturned and will not take effect. If Issue 2 passes, the law takes effect after the election and will be applied as current collective bargaining agreements expire. Although the 30-second commercial focuses on firefighters, SB 5 would affect about 360,000 public workers from teachers to prison guards to municipal workers. The commercial shows a burning house and firefighters suiting up to respond. Ohio firefighter Doug Stern, as he is identified in the commercial, urges voters to vote against Issue 2 because it will endanger firefighters and the neighborhoods they are responsible for protecting. "Issue 2 makes it illegal for us to negotiate for enough firefighters to do the job," Stern says. Issue 2 is expected to be the most high-profile race on the fall ballot. Accusations of misinforming the public have flown from both sides since the law was introduced earlier this year. PolitiFact Ohio decided to check the central claim of the first commercial in what will be an ongoing effort to keep both sides honest. SB 5 is a complete overhaul of Ohio’s collective bargaining law, which originally passed in 1983. A spokeswoman for We Are Ohio, an anti-Issue 2 political action committee that produced the commercial, pointed us to a provision in SB 5 that she said verified the ad’s claim. The law sets new rules for what topics cannot be negotiated and specifies other topics that are negotiable only if management agrees to do so. Overall, these new rules give management significantly more power at the bargaining table. Melissa Fazekas, a spokeswoman for We Are Ohio, said the number of firefighters on the job is among the topics that cannot be negotiated under SB 5. Specifically, the law amends a portion of Sec. 4117.08 of the Ohio Revised Code to say "the number of employees required to be on duty or employed in any department, division or facility of a public employer" is a subject "not appropriate" for collective bargaining. Other topics prohibited from negotiations under this section of the law include pension pickups – the practice of employers paying a share of workers’ pension contributions – and health care benefits. But supporters of Issue 2 and SB 5 insist that workers will be able to negotiate staffing as long as management agrees to do so. Jason Mauk, spokesman for the pro-Issue 2 group Building a Better Ohio, pointed us to other language in a different part of that same section that he says allows management to initiate talks on staffing. The law lists "the number of persons required to be employed or laid off" under topics that can be negotiated at management’s discretion. "Nothing says that employees cannot discuss staffing levels with employers," Mauk said. The two sides of this argument are an example of how confusing SB 5 can be. We have two similar topics that are treated differently under the law. One provision – "the number of employees required to be on duty" – is among topics prohibited from collective bargaining. The other – "the number of persons required to be employed" – can be discussed at management’s discretion. The key difference between the two is the phrase "on duty", said Mark Sanders, president of the Ohio Association of Professional Fire Fighters. Any negotiations related to the latter provision would only ensure, for example, that a city has a certain number of firefighters on the payroll, Sanders said. It would not cover the number of firefighters required to be on a fire engine, he said. The distinction between the two provisions, however, would be moot if management unilaterally decides it doesn’t want to discuss staffing at all. And Mauk said the bill is designed to give management, such as police chiefs and fire chiefs, the authority to decide staffing levels. Mauk said that is the way it is done in the private sector. Supporters of SB 5 like Mauk say Issue 2 is needed so mayors and others in management positions can cope with tightening budgets without cutting services or laying off workers. A key tenet of PolitiFact is that words matter. In this case, the words used in the statement were that "Issue 2 makes it illegal for us to negotiate for enough firefighters to do the job." We think the natural reading of "enough firefighters to do the job" is how many would be needed to fight a fire -- or on duty. Scenes in We Are Ohio’s ad show firefighters responding to a call, buttressing that notion. There is language in SB 5 that could allow negotiations on overall staffing levels -- a point of clarification -- but only if management allows the topic to be part of negotiations. And there is a clear prohibition against negotiating the number of workers "on duty." On the Truth-O-Meter, a statement that is accurate, but needs clarification rates Mostly True.

pomt-15174	Says Donald Trump "was a Democrat longer in the last decade than he was a Republican."	half-true	/florida/statements/2015/aug/24/jeb-bush/bush-says-trump-was-democrat-longer-republican-las/	After losing ground to Donald Trump in the polls following the first GOP presidential debate, Jeb Bush has gone on the attack, questioning the real estate mogul’s Republican bona fides. "Mr. Trump doesn't have a proven conservative record," Bush said at a town hall in Merrimack, N.H., on Aug. 19, 2015. "He was a Democrat longer in the last decade than he was a Republican." Bush also said Trump has given more money to Democrats than he has given to Republicans, a claim we’ve previously rated Mostly False. Bush tweeted video of the town hall the same night, calling Trump "a tax-hiking Democrat." In his defense, Trump said on Face The Nation on Aug. 23 that living in Manhattan for years affected his alignment. "I was from an area that was all Democrat," Trump said. "And, frankly, over the years, I have — and especially as I have gotten more and more involved — I have evolved." We know Trump has changed his political affiliation several times over the years, but we wanted to figure out just when and how the billionaire liked to party. Choosing sides Trump has regularly said that he has a broad range of political positions. "I identify with some things as a Democrat," he told MSNBC in July. He had told CNN the same thing back in 2004. He’s also expressed interest in running as a third-party candidate. According to the New York City Board of Elections, Trump has changed his party affiliation five times since registering as a Republican in Manhattan in 1987. A form that year notes he had previously been registered in the Jamaica Estates neighborhood of Queens, where he grew up, but his prior affiliation was not identified. Trump’s affiliations have gone back and forth since then. Here’s a quick look: Month and year of registration Party affiliation July 1987 Republican October 1999 Independence Party August 2001 Democrat September 2009 Republican December 2011 No party affiliation (independent) April 2012 Republican We don’t need to go back as far as 1987 for this check, of course, but it shows Trump has switched quite a bit. After 12 years as a Republican, he registered with the Independence Party in 1999. That moved Trump to New York’s version of the Reform Party, which is neither Democratic nor Republican. He even won the Reform Party’s California primary for president in March 2000, despite withdrawing from that contest. Bush’s campaign told us that "the last decade" meant when Trump was registered from 2000 to 2010. Trump was registered as a Democrat for 8 years, 1 month in that time span. But we think a reasonable person could mistake "the last decade" to mean the last 10 years. When we added up the years since 2005, we found Trump has been registered as a Democrat for 3 years, 9 months, and registered as Republican for 5 years, 6 months (and counting). Media reports said Trump’s switch in December 2011, where he checked "I do not wish to enroll in a party," made him an independent voter before the 2012 presidential election, in which he considered running himself. His attorney Michael Cohen told Politico that Trump made the change "in order to preserve his right to run as an independent if he is (not pleased) with the GOP nominee." Trump decided not to run that year. He switched back to Republican in April 2012. One last note: Party affiliation in New York matters for who a person can vote for in a primary contest, because New York has a closed primary, just like Florida. If someone wants to vote in a primary, they must be registered to that party. But according to a partial voting record from New York state, Trump hasn’t cast a ballot in at least the last two presidential primaries. Our ruling Bush said Trump "was a Democrat longer in the last decade than he was a Republican." The Bush campaign said he meant 2000 to 2010, during which Trump was a Democrat for a bit over nine years. Trump had largely been a Republican in the years prior to that. If that’s what Bush meant, he phrased his statement poorly. When we reviewed Trump’s voter registration in the 10 years leading up to the present, from 2005 to 2015, we found that he has been a Republican for more than five years. He was a registered Democrat for not quite four years in that time frame. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.

pomt-04064	The Milwaukee County Board’s staff grew from four workers to 38 over four decades and now costs taxpayers "a lot more," while the total county workforce was more than cut in half in the same period.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jan/24/chris-abele/county-executive-chris-abele-says-milwaukee-county/	Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele is blunt about one of the reasons he backs state legislation to drastically cut the pay and office budget of the county’s legislative branch. Supervisors elected to the County Board, says Abele, have much less to do than in county government’s heyday, but the board’s budget has ballooned. "In the ‘70s the county had about 11,000 employees," Abele said in a Jan. 18, 2013 interview on WTMJ radio (620 AM). "A lot of big functions have been moved from the county. Now we have 4,400 employees." In the 1970s, Abele continued, elected supervisors were part-time and the total County Board staff numbered three or four -- a couple committee clerks and a secretary. Now the staff totals 38 and supervisors’ pay is full-time. Abele concluded by claiming that supervisors "have a lot less to do and we are paying a lot more," and he offered the opinion that "government worked pretty well; you didn’t have a pension scandal back then." The state legislation to cut Milwaukee County supervisors’ pay by 70 percent (to $15,000) and the County Board budget by 85 percent is still in draft form. County Board defenders say it will gut the legislative branch and throw checks-and-balances to the wind. State lawmakers could take the measure up soon and Milwaukee County voters might be asked in a spring 2013 referendum to approve the salary cut. Let’s take a look at Abele’s assertion that the County Board staff has gone from "three or four" to 38 in four decades, and costs taxpayers "a lot more" even though the total county workforce is less than half its former size (11,000 to 4,400). Of course, we are not fact checking Abele’s opinion that things worked better in the old days. Nor are we checking in this item his assertion that supervisors are less busy today. County workforce Abele’s numbers on the overall county workforce are on target. County government employed 11,340 in 1975, compared to something between 4,000 and 4,600 today depending on how you count heads, according to county budget books and other documents we examined. The most recent payroll showed 4,397, according to the county’s human resources department. Since the 1970s, the county has sold Doyne Hospital, contracted out the bus system, sold off a power plant, stopped operating a baseball park, partially privatized the Milwaukee Public Museum and outsourced numerous services previously performed by county employees. The state took over the county’s child welfare, food aid and child care programs. The parks system alone has shed hundreds of workers. County Board staff Did the board have just three or four staff members at some point in the ‘70s, compared to 38 today (not counting the elected officials)? Close. In 1970, the board’s budget listed five staffers (typist, administrator, board secretary, researcher and fiscal analyst). But for an accurate comparison to the set-up today, you have to throw in three committee clerks who in 1970 were housed in the County Clerk’s office. Today they are under the County Board budget. So that’s a total of eight back then. Today, the board has 38 staff positions. Abele would have been slightly better off citing the 1960s instead of the 1970s as a reference point. By 1973, the board’s non-elected staff had jumped up to 21, and by 1975 it was 24. So for much of the decade, the staffing was closer to today’s levels. What’s changed? There are actually fewer elected supervisors now (18 today vs. 25 then) and they earn less in inflation-adjusted dollars compared to their 1970 counterparts. (The actual unadjusted salaries: $11,500 in 1970 vs. $50,679 now). But today, each lawmaker has a legislative aide to handle constituent calls and perform other tasks. Also, the board’s research staff has grown considerably, as has the number of general support staff. The board also has hired people to publicize its work and more formally communicate with the public. And it has its own staff to lobby other units of government on county issues. County Board budget Speaking broadly about the County Board budget, Abele said it costs taxpayers "a lot more" now than in 1970. Over a 40-year span, a big increase in raw numbers is hardly surprising. It went from $535,000 then to $6.6 million today. So, it’s more instructive to measure the change in inflation-adjusted dollars. When we ran those numbers, we found the County Board budget increase was more than double the inflation rate. By contrast, the overall county operating budget grew at slightly below the inflation rate for the period. Budgets are proposed by the County Executive and his department heads, then adopted with changes by the County Board. The system dates to 1960, when John Doyne became the first elected county executive. Our rating Abele said the County Board’s staff grew from three or four workers to 38 since the 1970s, and now costs taxpayers "a lot more," while the total county workforce was more than cut in half in the same period. He slightly overstates the growth in Board staff, and the time frame needs some clarification, but it’s accurate to say the County Board staff has grown notably since the early 1970s. And even in inflation-adjusted dollars, the board costs a lot more today than in 1970, from a budget standpoint, even though there are fewer elected supervisors. We rate Abele’s statement Mostly True.	None	Chris Abele	None	None	None	2013-01-24T09:00:00	2013-01-18	['None']
pomt-05694	Says 94 percent of Wisconsin employers think the state "is heading in the right direction" and a majority say they will "grow their companies in 2012."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/mar/11/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-94-percent-wisconsin-employe/	Democrats behind a recall of Gov. Scott Walker consistently mock the lack of progress on his promise to spur 250,000 new jobs in four years. In response, Walker emphasizes the falling unemployment rate and what he says is new optimism among business owners -- "job creators" in the current GOP parlance. As part of his case that things are trending well, Walker almost invariably says private businesses are nearly unanimous in their good feelings about the Walker era. "Looking ahead, we went from two years ago when 10 percent of our employers in the state thought we were heading in the right direction, to now, this year, 94 percent think we’re heading in the right direction – and a majority of them are going to grow their companies in 2012," Walker said in a Feb, 25, 2012 interview with Politico . He made that claim, almost word for word, in his Jan. 25, 2012 "state of the state" speech, saying "94 percent of our job creators believe Wisconsin is headed in the right direction." That 94 percent is a big number, especially when you consider there are some 160,000 business establishments in the state. Is Walker right about such overwhelming support among state employers? And are more than half planning growth in 2012? Asked for backup for the two-part claim, Walker pointed to a December 2011 online member survey by Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce of 281 chief executives. The powerful statewide trade organization backed Walker in 2010. In the WMC survey, 94 percent of the respondents said they "think things are going in the right direction" in Wisconsin. (Even more gave Walker positive marks as governor, which WMC officials said made sense given the success Walker had in enacting business tax cuts, regulatory reform and limits on liability lawsuits over the fierce objections of Democrats. By contrast, in a June 2010 WMC survey when Democrat Jim Doyle was governor, just 10 percent of respondents to the WMC survey said the state was on the right track. On the second part of the claim, a slim majority of CEOs -- 52 percent -- said their companies will see growth in the first half of 2012. That was down from a June 2011 WMC survey that found that 60 percent of CEO respondents predicted growth. When you reach back to the survey in Doyle’s last year, 55 percent saw growth ahead. So, Walker is right on the numbers. But what do they represent and how accurate are they? The survey was made available online to 1,167 CEOs, and WMC got responses from 24 percent -- 281 executives. That’s an acceptable response rate for such a survey, said David Wegge, a survey expert and political scientist at St. Norbert College. But Wegge said it’s not valid, from this kind of survey, to make a generalization about what businesses statewide think, because we don’t know the view of those who didn’t choose to join the group. It’s OK, he said, to draw conclusions about the WMC members’ views -- if the survey respondents are representative of WMC’s membership. The other critical question: Is WMC’s membership representative of the state’s employers as a whole? Let’s take a look. We compared the survey pool to a breakdown of Wisconsin’s business establishments by sector, based on data from the state Department of Workforce Development. The survey was heavy on manufacturers, followed by service providers -- pretty closely mirroring WMC’s membership, we found. But the survey respondents over-represented larger employers when compared with the group’s membership. Meanwhile, the survey respondents don’t match up well with Wisconsin’s statewide business profile. While a majority of survey respondents were manufacturing executives, manufacturing establishments are just 6 percent of Wisconsin’s businesses. WMC represents some small businesses, but half its 3,500 members have more than 50 employees. A much larger trade group, the National Federation of Independent Business, has 12,000 members, most of whom have fewer than 20 workers, including many mom-and-pop shops. NFIB has not surveyed its members. State director Bill Smith said the would expect his members would be as enthusiastic as WMC’s about the state’s direction, but there is no concrete evidence of that. The Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce, another trade group, conducts similar membership surveys. Bret Mayborne, research director for the association, said such polls are not scientifically rigorous but provide insight into trends over time. Our rating Walker says 94 percent of Wisconsin employers believe the state’s headed the right direction – and a majority of them say they are going to grow their companies in 2012. The numbers are correct, but they come from a small survey by one trade group and amount to a sample that is not reflective of the overall makeup of businesses in the state. Walker, however, presents it without noting the critical limitations. We rate his statement Half True.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2012-03-11T09:00:00	2012-02-25	['Wisconsin']
pomt-07417	"As far as standing committees, we have 10 fewer standing committees. So we’ve saved the state about a quarter-of-a-million dollars through the reduction of the standing committees."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2011/apr/27/cheryl-grossman/state-rep-cheryl-grossman-says-gop-cuts-standing-c/	Republicans, who control the Ohio House, called a news conference April 12 to pat themselves on the back for the work they had done the first 100 days of their two year stretch in the 129th General Assembly. The group, led by Speaker William G. Batchelder, is quite proud of some of its early accomplishments. A particular claim that state Rep. Cheryl Grossman, a Republican from Grove City near Columbus, made when it was her turn at the podium resonated most with Politifact Ohio. "As far as standing committees, we have 10 fewer standing committees. So we’ve saved the state about a quarter-of-a-million dollars ($250,000) through the reduction of the standing committees." said Grossman, a former Grove City mayor. At a time when Ohio’s economy is still struggling to recover from a devastating national recession in recent years which helped blow an $8 billion deficit in the state’s budget, any amount of savings is a good thing. So PolitiFact Ohio decided to check Grossman’s figures. We called the House Republican caucus (basically, Batchelder’s office) for an explanation and information to back up Grossman’s comments. The caucus said it verified its numbers through the House clerk’s office, which is considered independent but is run by a Republican appointed by Batchelder. (The speaker always gets to appoint the clerk and usually it is someone from the same political party.) To start with, Batchelder eliminated 10 standing committees that existed during the 128th General Assembly under House Speaker Armond Budish, a Democrat. That dropped the number of standing committees from 27 to 17. Above their standard annual pay, stipends are paid to leaders of the each committee: $6,500 for the chairman and $5,000 each to the vice-chairman and ranking minority member for a total of $16,500 in extra pay each year per committee. Multiply that by 10, the number of committees eliminated, and you come away with $165,000 in annual savings. Grossman didn’t say it, but can we give her the benefit of the doubt? She meant in each year of the biennium considering lawmakers salaries are paid on an annual schedule. So, that $165,000 over two years becomes $330,000 in savings, and that is not including the additional cost for benefits for lawmakers who receive the stipends. But Batchelder did add three new standing sub-committees that did not exist under Budish in the previous two years. The sub-committee chair gets $5,000 and ranking minority member $2,500 (there is no vice chairman for these committees) totaling $7,500 per subcommittee. By adding three sub-committees Batchelder created a new line of expense totaling $22,000 a year in extra pay for lawmakers, not including benefits. Subtract that from the savings generated from the elimination of sub-committees and House Republicans still save the state about $286,000. But hold on. While state representatives can serve in a leadership role on more than one committee they can only be paid one stipend. There were seven Democrats who pulled double duty under Budish, meaning they served as a chair or vice chair on more than one committee, but they were only paid one stipend, says House minority caucus spokesman Keary McCarthy. Michael Dittoe, a spokesman for House majority caucus, provided the math in an e-mail. The savings on stipend payments, when the unused stipends are removed, amounts to $217,000, he said. Adding in savings from retirement costs and administrative costs that aren't incurred raises that about 17 percent to just under $254,000. So it seems Grossman was right on the money as far as the dollars and cents in her claim. But wait, there’s more. Grossman says the House Republicans are "saving" the state money. That’s an attractive claim in the middle of budget season. Gov. John Kasich last month proposed a $55 billion, two year spending proposal that closes the deficit. The House is currently reviewing the proposal. According to an analysis of the House of Representatives budget proposal, Batchelder’s leadership team is requesting the same appropriation in each of the next two years as the House is spending in the current year, just shy of $20 million per year. "I’m not sure how one can claim savings when they are spending the exact same amount," said the Democrats McCarthy. Politifact Ohio followed up with Dittoe. Preparing the House budget request involved use of cost projections made prior to the new General Assembly being sworn into office. Those projections anticipate increased costs, particularly for health care benefits, that prompted the House to recommend a spending plan that could cover some "worst case scenarios," he said in an e-mail. He notes, though, that while the projections suggest healthcare costs could rise nearly $500,000 for just the members of the General Assembly, the requested budget was flat. The hope is that cuts elsewhere will cover those increases, if they come to pass. And, he added, that the exact funding level for the House won't be known until the budget is passed. So where does that leave us? There is an element of truth in Grossman’s claim: there are 10 fewer standing committees and the amount paid for leadership stipends will be less. But the bigger point she made that day while standing before a throng of media, including television cameras, was that Republicans are saving Ohio $250,000. Where’s the savings? Republicans may have cut spending in one area -- committee costs -- but the budget request for House operations is at the same level, which means that money was redirected to be spent elsewhere. And Dittoe cited one area in particular - health costs. That’s a critical fact that would give the listener a different impression of Grossman’s claim -- that characterizing the committee changes as a savings to the state of Ohio is misleading. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Grossman’s statement as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Cheryl Grossman	None	None	None	2011-04-27T06:00:00	2011-04-12	['None']
pomt-01032	Only "18 percent of jobs are accessible by transit for metro Atlanta residents. 33 percent for those living in the city."	true	/georgia/statements/2015/jan/28/keith-parker/marta-official-correct-about-commuters-limited-opt/	One day before a pedestrian death last Thursday triggered a massive traffic jam that made thousands of Atlanta workers late for work, the head of MARTA posted a provocative Tweet. MARTA General Manager Keith Parker wrote, "18 percent of jobs are accessible by transit for metro Atlanta residents, 33 percent for those living in the city." The statement came with the hashtag OpportunityATL, days after yet another major business, Mercedes-Benz USA, announced a corporate relocation that puts it next to both highways and MARTA rail. Is there something to the claim that stretches beyond the miles of snarled traffic on four highways last week? We decided to check it out. First, as the hashtag indicates, the statement did not come out of the ether. Parker posted the figures as he live-Tweeted presentations at a forum sponsored by the Atlanta Regional Commission and St. Vincent de Paul Society. Author Rebecca Burns was the keynote at the Building Opportunity event focused on poverty and transportation. She cited The Brookings Institution for those statistics on a slide during her presentation. To find out if those stats are accurate, we reached out to Brookings’ Metropolitan Policy Program. That’s the unit that conducts research for cities and their surrounding suburbs and exurbs. A 2011 report, "Missed Opportunity: Transit and Jobs in Metropolitan America," found that the Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Marietta metro area was among the worst in the nation for residents trying to reach work via transit. The study, the most recent available, looked at how many people can reach work in 90 minutes between 6 a.m. and 9 a.m. on a Monday morning. Typical residents in the nation’s largest 100 metro areas can reach about 30 percent of jobs by transit in 90 minutes, the study found. In Atlanta, the transit systems studied included MARTA, Georgia Regional Transportation Authority (GRTA) and regional bus services in Cobb and Gwinnett counties. Yet workers here can reach just 22 percent of jobs that way. That ranked Atlanta 91st out of the 100 largest metro areas studied. The numbers are, as Parker’s Tweet suggested, even worse for the region’s suburbanites. The study found that 33 percent of the region’s jobs are accessible for city residents by public transportation and just 17 percent for suburbanites. "In some ways, it’s not surprising, given the age the cities developed in," said Adie Tomer, a research fellow at Brookings who co-authored the study. "Atlanta was really built in the era of the car, and so it’s built out in a suburban style." So the numbers are pretty on target and somewhat expected. More than the exact numbers, though, is the overarching point. Tomer said cities with more transit access are effectively providing more options for workers. They can drive to work, ride a train, ride a bike, or even walk. Meanwhile, the traffic jam last week showed the "virus" effect a back-up can have on highways as well as surface streets when those options are limited. That ripple effect is prompting more suburban counties to gear up for serious talks about transportation options and has even put "public transit" in the mix of the state Legislature’s debate this year about transportation improvements. The challenges are clear. An exclusive Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll recently found that almost 70 percent of Georgians support new bus and rail lines. But only 36 percent said they’d pay higher taxes to pay for transportation improvements. Yet the benefits are just as clear. Mercedes-Benz USA’s CEO recently cited easy access for workers as a factor in its planned to move to Sandy Springs – suburban but adjacent to rail lines. Other major firms, from State Farm to PulteGroup, have made similar statements about their relocations. MARTA and other public transit projects have likewise had a run of good headlines. Clayton County residents voted in November for their county become the third to join MARTA – the first in 40 years. The Atlanta Streetcar's launch in December, the first expansion of a new rail line in years, drew attention nationally. To that end, Parker said he posted that Tweet because the statistics startled him. Looking at them another way, at least six out of every 10 metro workers lacks access by public transportation to jobs. Like Tomer, Parker hopes the existing collaboration between MARTA and bus lines in outlying counties will be seen by policy makers as an option - one to further investigate and expand. "We want people to look at us as a real alternative to get them to work, to school, to recreation," Parker said. "You can know with a sense of certainty that 95 percent of the time we are on time with train service. I dare say we don’t have that level of certainty on the highway system right now. We want people to see this is a viable option." So as state and local leaders hash out ideas to discuss those options, can they count on the statistics reflecting workers’ access to jobs by public transit today? Parker posted a Tweet from a forum, claiming 33 percent of people in the city and 18 percent elsewhere have that access. An independent analysis confirmed the point, if not the precise number for suburbanites. We rate the claim True.	None	Keith Parker	None	None	None	2015-01-28T00:00:00	2015-01-21	['Atlanta']
pomt-13586	Says military commanders have said that if Donald Trump were elected, "they would not follow his orders."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/17/joe-biden/joe-biden-rips-donald-trump-over-commanders-fears-/	During a joint speech with Hillary Clinton in his ancestral home of Scranton, Pa., Vice President Joe Biden riffed on the ways he sees Donald Trump as being unfit for the presidency. One of the things that Biden said troubled him among Trump’s past comments is his suggestion that the United States may need to utilize "torture." Biden said that Trump has floated the use of torture "when he knows it's illegal, and says he would still order it even though the military commanders said they would not obey his orders. When can you think of ever in history where military commanders have said before a man or woman is elected that they would not follow his orders?" Biden has a point that Trump has advocated loosening laws on torture, including -- but not limited to -- waterboarding. Just one example: Trump said on CBS’s Face the Nation that the United States needs to "strengthen the laws so that we can better compete" with the brutal tactics of ISIS, and he dismissed the idea that allowing torture would be stooping to ISIS' level. "We have to play the game the way they're playing the game," Trump said. "You're not going to win if we're soft." In addition, Trump has proposed killing the families of terrorists, a policy that, as we have written before, would violate the Geneva Conventions. However, Biden’s remark suggests that active military commanders have already said before the election that they would not follow certain orders issued by Trump. That’s an overstatement, although one that contains some degree of truth. Let’s take a closer look. Who has said what about Trump so far? We could find no evidence -- and Biden’s staff couldn’t point to any -- showing active military commanders saying they would not follow certain orders from a President Trump. Typically, military officers do not comment on political matters while on active duty, in order to stay within the strictures of Defense Department Directive 1344.10. Senior national security retirees, though, are another story. Biden’s staff pointed to comments made in February by former CIA director Michael Hayden on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher. When Maher brought up Trump's idea of killing family members of terrorists, Hayden said, "If he were to order that once in government, the American armed forces would refuse to act." Maher responded, "What? Well, that’s quite a statement, sir." In the meantime, 50 senior Republican national security officials signed a letter on Aug. 8, 2016, arguing that Trump "lacks the character, values and experience" to be president and "would put at risk our country’s national security and well-being." The letter did not explicitly say that the signers would personally refuse, or encourage active commanders to refuse, an illegal order from Trump. But the letter represented a sharp rebuke to Trump’s fitness for office by members of his party’s national security establishment. We should point out that Trump does have some senior military retirees on his side as well, including former Defense Intelligence Agency chief Michael T. Flynn, decorated Army Maj. Gen. Bert Mizusawa, retired Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Mark Bircher, retired four star Air Force Gen. Robert Oaks, and retired Army Maj. Gen. Paul Vallely. Bottom line: In his Scranton comments, Biden exaggerated by saying that current military commanders have publicly said "they would not follow" illegal orders from Trump. There’s no evidence of that. What does the law say? That said, Biden’s overstatement is somewhat moot -- because whether or not military commanders have publicly said in advance that they would refuse illegal orders, there’s solid legal precedent that they should refuse an illegal order if one came their way. "Under both international law and domestic law, a soldier has a duty to disobey a manifestly unlawful order," said Steven R. Ratner, a law professor at the University of Michigan. "It doesn’t matter who gave it." According to the Manual for Courts-Martial, if "an order is patently illegal, a service member has an obliga­tion to disobey it," said Richard D. Rosen, director of the Texas Tech University's Center for Military Law & Policy. The so-called "Nuremberg Defense" to criminal activity — "I was only following orders" — excuses a service ­member’s crimi­nal actions "only if the ordered actions are not palpably illegal," Rosen said. This represents a pretty high standard. However, the types of orders at issue here -- such as the infliction of torture and the intentional killing of civilians -- would likely qualify, experts said. "I believe that an order to target and kill civilians intentionally, such as killing the families of terrorists, is patently illegal, and I would advise commanders and soldiers not to follow the order," Rosen said. He cited the Vietnam War case of Lt. William Calley, a platoon leader who was accused of killing civilians, including women, children, and elderly men, in the village of My Lai in South Vietnam. Calley’s defense was that he was executing the orders of his company commander, but both the Army Court of Military Review and Court of Military Appeals rejected Calley’s defense, Rosen said. How unusual is the backlash against Trump? Finally, experts say Biden has a point about the unusual extent of senior military concern about a presidential candidate’s potential for ordering illegal acts from the White House. "There have certainly been overt disputes between presidents and commanders," such as between President Abraham Lincoln and Maj. Gen. George McClellan and between President Harry Truman and Gen. Douglas MacArthur, Rosen said. "But I am not aware of cases in which active-duty servicemembers actually took sides in a political campaign." Anthony Clark Arend, a Georgetown University professor of government and foreign service, agreed. "I can think of no historical precedent for members of the military and foreign policy community making statements relating to the need to disobey unlawful orders during a presidential campaign," Arend said. "This truly seems unprecedented." Our ruling Biden said military commanders have said that if Trump were elected, "they would not follow his orders." Biden has a point that retired military officials have spoken out against Trump. But he exaggerated when he described them as "military commanders." The current active leadership has not spoken out against Trump. We rate his statement Mostly False.	None	Joe Biden	None	None	None	2016-08-17T18:37:07	2016-08-15	['None']
pomt-00686	"Baltimore spends the third highest per capita on its public schools."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2015/may/05/chris-wallace/foxs-wallace-baltimore-ranks-third-school-spending/	The Baltimore riot has many people talking about how life could be improved in neighborhoods that have been in the grip of poverty for many decades. Rep. Donna Edwards, D-Md., said on Fox News Sunday that investing in schools is an obvious step. But host Chris Wallace pushed back. "It’s not a matter of money," Wallace said on May 3, 2015. "One of the things that we learned this week is Baltimore spends the third-highest per capita on its public schools. Baltimore was already spending plenty on public schools, and the schools were still lousy." To get to "third-highest," Wallace is counting only the 100 largest school districts -- and lopping off more affluent communities in the process. Fox News told us that Wallace relied on a Census Bureau release that compared the 100 largest school districts nationwide. (Wallace misspoke slightly. He should have said per-pupil spending, not per capita.) Among the 100 largest districts, Baltimore does spend more per pupil than all-but two other districts: School district Enrollment $ per pupil New York City 990,145 $20,226 Boston 55,027 $19,720 Baltimore 84,212 $15,287 Anchorage 48,765 $14,963 Montgomery County 146,459 $14,873 The problem is there are more than 15,000 school districts across the country, and there are hundreds that spend more. Among school districts with at least 5,000 students, Baltimore ranks 160th in spending. Or to give another example, Baltimore ranks 20th among the 500 largest school districts: Rank School District Enrollment $ per pupil Rank School District Enrollment $ per pupil 1 Newark 35,543 $23,946 11 Jersey City 27,397 $18,259 2 New York City 990,145 $20,226 12 Brentwood, N.Y. 17,143 $18,034 3 Elizabeth, N.J. 23,386 $20,220 13 New Haven 20,554 $17,615 4 Boston 55,027 $19,720 14 District of Columbia 44,618 $17,468 5 Buffalo 32,723 $18,971 15 Arlington County, Va. 21,892 $17,338 6 Hartford 20,931 $18,843 16 Christina, Del. 16,303 $17,026 7 Yonkers 25,326 $18,798 17 Waterbury, Conn. 18,061 $16,030 8 Rochester 31,432 $18,762 18 Pittsburgh 26,653 $15,615 9 Paterson, N.J. 24,365 $18,590 19 Springfield, Ma. 25,185 $15,374 10 Syracuse 20,491 $18,387 20 Baltimore 84,212 $15,287 The spending vs. results debate Wallace simplified a complex problem when he said improving Baltimore’s schools "is not about money." There are studies on both sides of that debate. To pick one that supports Wallace’s view, researchers looked at four years of data on Pennsylvania schools. In 2010, the 21st Century Partnership for STEM Education in Philadelphia compared spending in nearly 500 school districts to 11th grade test results. The strongest predictor of high scores was the fraction of adults in the district with a four-year college degree. F. Joseph Merlino is the organization’s president. "You would think that spending more money would lead to better outcomes," Merlino said. "But the results are very weak." The report said "Spending per pupil, regardless of expenditure category, had either no association with student achievement or at best only a weak positive or a weak negative correlation with student achievement. " On the other hand, professors at Northwestern University and the University of California-Berkeley looked at four decades in school districts where spending increased under court order. In a report published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, they said that for low income children who spent all 12 years in schools where spending rose at least 20 percent, graduation rates rose by 23 percentage points. There were also "25 percent higher earnings, and a 20 percentage-point reduction in the annual incidence of adult poverty." At the same time, increased spending had little impact on the education of children from families making more money. Our ruling Wallace said that Baltimore ranks third in per capita school spending.

pomt-03827	Says we will pay the new chancellor "a basic salary of nearly $300,000 a year ... an amount that does not include the costs of this public employee’s benefits, perks and living expenses for a lavish house, an upscale car, a spending allowance, and fine dining almost every day on the taxpayer dollar."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2013/mar/20/gene-mcintyre/does-ous-chancellor-get-lavish-house-upscale-car-a/	Grumbling about the salaries and benefits of public employees is a longtime favorite sport of political observers. That was certainly the case following the recent appointment of Melody Rose as interim chancellor of the state’s seven public universities. Rose, who previously served as vice chancellor, replaced George Pernsteiner, who announced his resignation in January. Rose faces many challenges as the state revamps its higher education system, and she will apparently be compensated well for her work — too well, according to Keizer resident Gene H. McIntyre. In a Feb. 22 guest opinion column for the Keizertimes, McIntyre wrote that "We will pay (Rose) a basic salary of nearly $300,000 a year, and that’s to start, an amount that does not include the costs of this public employee’s benefits, perks and living expenses for a lavish house, an upscale car, a spending allowance, and fine dining almost every day on the taxpayer dollar." That got our mouths watering and our minds wondering. Fine dining practically every day? A lavish house and upscale car? (Perhaps journalism was not our true calling?) We obtained a copy of Rose’s employment agreement, which shows that she earns an annual base salary of $260,004. Rose receives $14,424 in annual medical benefits, the same as other employees in the Chancellor’s Office, according to Di Saunders, spokeswoman for the Oregon University System. Rose is not enrolled in the Public Employees Retirement System. Instead, she chose the Optional Retirement Plan, a defined contribution plan created in 1996 for unclassified academic and administrative employees. The university system contributes the maximum $51,000 toward her retirement every year. Rose also receives a $12,000 annual car allowance for her to drive to various campuses and meetings. She does not receive mileage reimbursements. Then there’s the annual $20,694 she receives "for professional development and expenses," according to her contract. The money is paid to Rose like salary and is considered taxable income, Saunders said. The money is intended to cover membership dues for civic clubs, conference fees, and "appropriate and necessary expenses that might not be eligible for expense reimbursement under OUS policy," Saunders wrote in an e-mail. "Let’s say there’s somebody coming to speak at a conference, and they take them out to dinner," Saunders said. "It’s things that you wouldn’t want to use your general fund budget for, but they’re expenses a chancellor should take care of." Rose is not required to submit receipts for those expenses, so she could theoretically use all of that money at upscale restaurants. If she spent $100 on each fine-dining meal, she could treat herself to about 207 fancy meals. Now about that "lavish house." The chancellor is offered Treetops, a mansion adjacent to the University of Oregon in Eugene. The 8,000-square-foot mansion, built in 1911, was the official home of Pernsteiner, who split his time between Eugene and Portland. Rose declined to move to Treetops and lives in Portland with her family, Saunders said. All told, Rose receives $358,122 annually in salary, benefits and expenses. She’s also entitled to the usual reimbursements for work-related expenses and travel. Is Rose’s compensation out of line? Saunders directed us to a 2011 chart on the website of The Chronicle of Higher Education that shows median salaries— not including benefits — of senior college administrators. Administrators at Rose’s level have an overall median salary of $322,700. McIntyre based his column on information he had gathered through his years working in education and state government, he said in a phone interview from his Keizer home. McIntyre says he’s a retired language arts and social sciences teacher who served about a decade on the now-defunct Oregon Educational Coordinating Commission, which oversaw the distribution of federal education money. "I know people can live very, very well on a lot less money than we’re paying these people," he said. "We have a lot of social problems — a lot of kids are going hungry, a lot of folks have lost their homes — and yet, we continue to pay some of these people just what I’d consider excessive amounts of money." But is it true that Rose receives "a basic salary of nearly $300,000 a year" and "benefits, perks and living expenses for a lavish house, an upscale car, a spending allowance and fine dining almost every day on the taxpayer dollar" as McIntyre wrote in his column? Rose earns $260,004 in base salary -- not quite the $300,000 McIntyre cites. It’s accurate to say her base salary does not include the $65,424 she gets in medical and retirement benefits. McIntyre’s description of Rose’s other perks is partially true: Rose receives a car allowance and an expense account, but she does not live in Treetops and likely isn’t treating herself to fine dining almost every day. We rate this statement Half True.	None	Gene McIntyre	None	None	None	2013-03-20T03:00:00	2013-02-22	['None']
pomt-14092	"We've already lost $500 million in economic impact" from HB2 fallout in North Carolina.	false	/north-carolina/statements/2016/may/16/chris-sgro/democratic-representative-says-north-carolina-has-/	In calling on state leaders to repeal House Bill 2, a Democratic state representative – Chris Sgro, who also leads a group suing over the new law – cited both his moral opposition and the financial backlash North Carolina has suffered. "We've already lost $500 million in economic impact and now we are violating federal civil rights law and risking Title IX funding," Sgro said in a press release after the Obama administration announced its belief that HB2 violates various federal laws. "This is a travesty and embarrassment for North Carolina." The General Assembly passed HB2 in March. The wide-ranging state law includes a requirement that people in government facilities use bathrooms that match the gender on their birth certificate. A number of businesses, performing artists, conventions and more have announced boycotts of the Tar Heel State in response. That led Sgro (who was appointed to the General Assembly after HB2 passed and is the only openly gay legislator in North Carolina) to claim the law has cost North Carolina half a billion dollars. North Carolina’s gross domestic product in 2015 was about $500 billion. So a $500 million loss wouldn’t be that much in the grand scheme of things. But it would still be important for the individuals and businesses who had counted on having that money. ‘Really tangible losses’ Sgro said he was quoting a study from the Center for American Progress (CAP). The D.C.-based liberal think tank published a study April 13 that detailed the actual and potential economic losses through 2018, due to boycotts over HB2. North Carolina had already lost $86.3 million by mid-April, according to the report. So why did Sgro say $500 million a short time later? It’s worth noting that the CAP study isn’t the only one – Time Warner Cable News put the losses at $77 million. But since Sgro said he was citing the CAP study, we’ll look at that one. Reading further, the CAP report goes on to say that North Carolina could lose an additional $481.2 million in the future, for a total of $567.5 million. That’s the number Sgro said he was referring to. The key here is the distinction the report makes between money that’s at risk versus money already lost. In an interview, though, Sgro defended combining the two. And his group, Equality NC, later repeated the figure in a second press release. "I really think the higher number is the more accurate way to couch the economics of this," he said. "There are some really tangible losses already." There are indeed tangible losses. But even throwing in an estimated, yet-to-be-verified loss suffered by the High Point Furniture Market – which happened between when the study was released and when Sgro made his remarks – the "already lost" tally still isn’t even half of the $500 million Sgro claimed. We double-checked each of the individual losses listed in the study that made up the $86.3 million figure and were able to confirm all of them except for $3 million attributed to Lionsgate pulling a comedy film crew from Charlotte. CAP used an outdated report to come to that conclusion; we found a more recent report that put it about $1 million lower. The CAP study was released before Asheville announced more than $1 million in losses after a conference cancellation. Since that essentially cancels out the difference, we’ll continue to use the $86.3 million cited by CAP. Sgro said there are also losses that can’t be counted, like businesses that have quietly decided not to consider coming to North Carolina. Google’s venture capital branch has also pledged not to invest in North Carolina, and several studios have said they won’t film in the Tar Heel State – all losses that are difficult to quantify. "It’s significant, and it's compounding every single day we don't repeal the bill," Sgro said. Still, though, those are future potential losses – not money that has already been lost or pulled. And we weren’t convinced by the argument that it’s accurate to lump the two together. That’s because a closer look shows that many of the companies listed in the CAP study haven’t actually promised to pull their investments out of North Carolina if HB2 remains state law. ESPN "said it’s re-evaluating its plans," to bring the X Games to Charlotte, according to the Charlotte Observer. That’s a potential loss estimated at $50 million, but it might not happen even if HB2 remains the law. The same goes for another $127.5 million from Braeburn Pharmaceuticals, Red Ventures, the NCAA and various conferences in Raleigh. In each of those cases, the groups said only that they would reconsider plans in North Carolina. None said for certain that HB2 would derail those plans. Two big hits The NBA has been more certain about moving its 2017 All Star Game from Charlotte if HB2 remains intact, but that’s still only a potential loss – and one that the CAP study may have over-exaggerated. The study lists its economic impact as $195 million. That’s the same number estimated for the 2015 All Star game in New York City. But not only has the accuracy of that 2015 estimate been called into question, it’s also worth asking if New York is really the best comparison. When doing its own estimates, the City of Charlotte used the 2014 All Star game in New Orleans, a city much closer in size, tourism draw and prices than New York. That game likely brought New Orleans a much lower impact of $106 million. And what about CAP’s estimated $143.4 million from High Point Furniture Market losses? The law was condemned by many businesses and trade associations connected to the twice-yearly market, which has generated more than $5 billion in recent years and has been called North Carolina’s largest economic event. The $143.4 million number would represent a small decline in its economic impact. But we have no way of knowing whether it’s an accurate estimate. Tom Conley, the market’s CEO, told us the market is still trying to get an accurate count of this April’s attendance and any possible losses. But for the sake of argument, we’ll give CAP and Sgro the benefit of the doubt here. Using CAP’s formula and attendance numbers from previous spring shows, we calculated that of the $143.4 million that could be lost at some point, $55.4 million could’ve already been lost at last month’s market. A researcher with CAP told us he thinks the group’s number was even a bit conservative, pointing to a story from CBS News that estimated the losses from this spring alone could hit $115 million. Neither number, though, gets Sgro’s "already lost" claim even close to $500 million. If the CAP estimates on the furniture market turn out to be accurate, then combined with the $86.3 million in already lost and documented funds, we come to a total of $141.7 million already lost from North Carolina’s economy. That’s less than a third of what Sgro said. Using the CBS estimate for the furniture market, the total rises to $201.3 million. Finally, it’s important to note that that some of the already-lost money might even return to North Carolina in the future. PayPal and Deutsche Bank stopped plans to hire hundreds of workers, but they also both said they might change their minds if HB2 is repealed. Our ruling North Carolina’s economy has already lost, by various counts, either $77 million, $86.3 million, $141.7 million or $201.3 million. None of those are even close to the $500 million Sgro claimed has already been lost. It’s true that the state might eventually lose up to $567.5 million in economic impact, according to one study. Sgro was using that number, but the vast majority of that money hasn’t already been lost, like he claimed it had been. What’s more, many of the businesses threatening boycotts haven’t even said for certain that they will cancel if HB2 remains law, meaning the $567.5 million figure could drop substantially. And if HB2 is repealed, it’s also possible that some of the "already lost" money might return in the form of new jobs and investments.

pomt-15257	"We built a new prison every 10 days between 1990 and 2005 to keep up with our mass incarceration explosion of nonviolent offenders."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/31/cory-booker/was-prison-built-every-10-days-house-fast-growing-/	With criminal justice reform in the national spotlight, first-term Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., commented on the growth of the prison system in recent years. "We built a new prison every 10 days between 1990 and 2005 to keep up with our mass incarceration explosion of nonviolent offenders," Booker said in a post to his Instagram account on July 27, 2015. Before joining the Senate, Booker served as mayor of Newark. Is Booker’s claim correct? We decided to check. Prison growth, 1990-2005 We’ll start by evaluating the first part of Booker’s claim about a new prison being built on a near weekly basis between 1990 and 2005. Booker’s communications director, Jeff Giertz, pointed to an almost identical quote in Bryan Stevenson’s book, Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption, published in 2014. Stevenson is a law professor at New York University School of Law and executive director of a nonprofit group in Montgomery, Ala., called the Equal Justice Initiative. "Between 1990 and 2005 a new prison opened in the United States every 10 days," Stevenson wrote. Neither Booker’s nor Stevenson’s statements specify state or federal prisons, but if we assume they are referring to both types of prisons, then data and an expert we contacted largely corroborate this claim. According to a Congressional Research Service report, "the number of state and federal adult correctional facilities rose from 1,277 in 1990 to 1,821 in 2005, a 43% increase." That’s an increase of 544 new facilities. There are 5,478 days in a 15-year span, which works out to almost exactly one facility every 10 days on average. John Pfaff, a professor at Fordham Law School specializing criminal justice and the recent boom in mass incarceration, said Booker’s claim is correct if it includes both types of prisons. Pflaff said Booker is actually underselling the statistic by not going back to 1984. Between 1984 and 2005, the number of facilities grew by about one every 8.5 days. That said, Booker’s time frame makes some sense because "crime began to drop in 1991," and 2005 is the latest available year from the Bureau of Justice Statistics’ Census of State and Federal Correctional Facilities. Mass incarceration of nonviolent offenders The second part of Booker’s claim is somewhat less clear. Grietz of Booker’s staff pointed to data that showed the total number of nonviolent offenders incarcerated between 1980 and 2013 grew from 122,000 to 607,000 in 2013 -- a 400 percent increase, compared to a 300 percent increase of incarcerated violent offenders. But for the specific period discussed in Booker’s Instagram post, the data runs counter to his point. Pfaff pointed to data gathered by a study in the Harvard Journal on Legislation that shows violent offenders contributed 60 percent to state prison growth between 1990 and 2009, while nonviolent offenders (drug and property offenses combined) contributed only 27 percent. Pfaff also added that the universe of state inmates is much larger than the pool of federal inmates. All told, 86 percent of prisoners are in state systems while only 14 percent are in the federal system. As it turns out, the big increase happened earlier. The data shows that 55 percent of state inmate growth came from nonviolent offenders between 1980 and 1990, before declining to 27 percent between 1990 and 2009. So Booker is wrong to focus on the period 1990 to 2005 when discussing a "mass incarceration explosion of nonviolent offenders." A big rise did occur, but it started earlier than Booker’s post indicated. Finally, we’ll note that in the much smaller universe of federal inmates, 76 percent and 72 percent of those sentenced to federal prison were sentenced for nonviolent offenses, according to U.S. Sentencing Commission data for 2012 and 2013. Our ruling Booker said, "We built a new prison every 10 days between 1990 and 2005 to keep up with our mass incarceration explosion of nonviolent offenders." Booker is right that a new prison was built every 10 days during that period. But while there was a significant rise in the incarceration rate of nonviolent offenders, it took place over a longer time period than the post indicates -- between 1980 and 2013. On balance, we rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Cory Booker	None	None	None	2015-07-31T14:17:30	2015-07-27	['None']
pomt-03416	The Southern Baptist Convention voted 13 years ago "that women were inferior and had to be subservient to their husbands."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2013/jun/28/jimmy-carter/carter-baptist-group-diminishes-roles-women/	Former President Jimmy Carter recently gave a striking example of what he says is one particular way women are ill-treated by an influential group in this country. "As you may or may not know, the Southern Baptist Convention back now about 13 years ago in Orlando, voted that women were inferior and had to be subservient to their husbands, and ordained that a woman could not be a deacon or a pastor or a chaplain or even a teacher in a classroom in some seminaries where men are in the classroom, boys are in the classroom," Carter said in an interview with Time magazine. "So my wife and I withdrew from the Southern Baptist Convention primarily because of that." News accounts and the organization’s website confirm the SBC’s belief that only men can be pastors. What was less clear to us was whether the organization "voted that women were inferior and had to be subservient to their husbands." PolitiFact Georgia decided to do some research. Carter, a Democrat, gave the interview in advance of the Mobilizing Faith for Women conference, which was scheduled from June 27 to 29 at his presidential center in Atlanta. The conference is aimed at improving the lives of women around the world. The Carter Center’s website says prior conferences have helped combat issues such as human trafficking and sexual violence. Carter, a former Georgia governor, is listed as a speaker. The Southern Baptist Convention, which organized in Augusta in 1845, claims nearly 16 million members from more than 45,000 churches. It believes in the basic tenets of Christianity, supports mission work worldwide and has claimed some of the nation’s most powerful political leaders among its membership. Former President Bill Clinton grew up as a Southern Baptist. Carter spokeswoman Deanna Congileo said the former president based his comments on a resolution concerning the family structure that the Southern Baptists passed in 1998. The four-paragraph statement, Article XVIII, aims to define the roles of men and women in marriage. The most pertinent portion of the section, the third paragraph, reads: "The husband and wife are of equal worth before God, since both are created in God's image. The marriage relationship models the way God relates to His people. A husband is to love his wife as Christ loved the church. He has the God-given responsibility to provide for, to protect, and to lead his family. A wife is to submit herself graciously to the servant leadership of her husband even as the church willingly submits to the headship of Christ. She, being in the image of God as is her husband and thus equal to him, has the God-given responsibility to respect her husband and to serve as his helper in managing the household and nurturing the next generation." The section was based, in part, on Ephesians 5:21-24, which is in the New Testament. Verses 22-24 of the New International Version of the Bible say: "Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything." Southern Baptist leaders said the article was written to encourage Americans to seek traditional family values in response to rising divorce rates, children born out of wedlock and violence by children against their parents. The language about women made national news. Some activists and others were outraged at what they deemed sexist language by the Southern Baptist Convention. Others, including many Christian women, said they agreed with the Southern Baptist resolution, The Chicago Tribune reported in 1998. "It doesn't mean that the husband gets the last say every time," Susan Robinson, a secretary at Riverside Baptist Church in Denver, told the Tribune. "It's spiritual leadership." Carter, who announced he was leaving the Southern Baptist Convention in 2000, was quoted in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution at the time as saying Southern Baptist leaders were taking biblical passages out of context. "President Carter interprets the word ‘submit’ as placing women in an inferior position. (Submissive and subservient are synonyms.)," Congileo told us via email. Webster’s list of synonyms for submissive include amenable, compliant, docile and obedient. Congileo said she had no further comment to our follow-up questions concerning Article XVIII’s use of the word "equal" in the resolution. To sum up, Carter claimed the Southern Baptist Convention voted in favor of a resolution that women were inferior and had to be subservient to their husbands. Carter is wrong on the "inferior" portion of his statement. The resolution says wives are of equal value before God. Carter gets closer on his "subservient" claim. The former president interprets the line in the resolution about wives submitting themselves to the "servant leadership" of their husbands as tantamount to wives being subservient. That is certainly open to interpretation, given the definition of "servant leadership" (one who "serves" the people he/she "leads"). Carter has a case if you cherry-pick the document. But the former president begins sliding down the Truth-O-Meter if you look at Article XVIII and its possible interpretations. Overall his statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That meets PolitiFact’s definition of Mostly False.

pomt-03679	Says 315,000 mostly minority Texas students are enrolled in failing schools.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2013/apr/24/dan-patrick/dan-patrick-says-315000-mostly-minority-texas-stud/	Advocating a bill he introduced to help public school students pay for private school, state Sen. Dan Patrick said in an April 9, 2013, committee hearing, "We have 315,000 mostly minority students in failing schools." The Houston Republican’s Senate Bill 23 would provide a tax credit to businesses that donate to a private school scholarship fund. Since he and Lt. Gov. Dewhurst announced the plan in December 2012, they have referred to the plight of students in schools rated academically unacceptable. In the April 9 hearing, Patrick spoke of "trapping a poor student in a poor-performing school -- of which we have 532 in our state, out of 8,500 campuses." Overall, about 70 percent of Texas’ 5 million students in 2011-12 belonged to groups traditionally considered minorities, according to 2011-12 Texas Education Agency data. We wondered how the picture changed when looking only at students in schools rated unacceptable. Patrick’s chief of staff, Logan Spence, sent us a spreadsheet from the education agency showing 2011-12 enrollment data for 530 schools rated unacceptable, the lowest category in the state’s most recent accountability ratings, which are from 2011. No rulings were issued in 2012, as the state is phasing out TAKS (Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills) tests and replacing them with STAAR (State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness) exams. Via email, agency spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe verified the numbers for us and said that the tally of campuses rated unacceptable had fluctuated as schools appealed ratings, ending up at 530. By our calculations using the agency’s data, the number of nonwhite students in "unacceptable" schools was 315,073 in 2010-11, but 304,139 in 2011-12. Spence told us Patrick has used totals from both years in speeches. We calculated that non-white students made up 77.8 percent of the enrollment at "unacceptable" schools in 2010-11 and 78.4 percent of the enrollment at "unacceptable" schools in 2011-12. The breakdown for 2011-12 enrollment at schools rated unacceptable, using the agency’s categories: Hispanic -- 51.4 percent African American -- 23.5 percent White -- 21.8 percent Asian -- 1.5 percent "Two or more races" -- 1.2 percent American Indian -- 0.5 percent Pacific Islander -- 0.08 percent At schools rated acceptable or better in 2011-12, we found, the enrollment was 68.5 percent non-white. And those schools accounted for the vast majority of Texas’ 4.98 million students in 2011-12. Schools rated acceptable or better served 91.4 percent of Texas students, including 91 percent of the state’s 3.4 million non-white students. Again using the agency’s data, we broke out the percentage of non-white students for the other school rating levels, and found that the percentage of non-white students decreased with each step up: "Exemplary" schools -- 14.7 percent of Texas students, 56 percent of them non-white. "Recognized" schools -- 35.4 percent of Texas, 69.5 percent non-white. "Acceptable" schools -- 41.3 percent of Texas, 73 percent non-white. "Unacceptable" schools -- 6.1 percent of Texas, 78.4 percent non-white. Our ruling Patrick said Texas has "315,000 mostly minority students in failing schools." That matches an outdated figure -- the 2010-11 non-white population at such schools. For 2011-12, there were 304,139 students in "unacceptable" schools. In both cases, about 78 percent of the students in the faltering schools were "minority," meaning non-white. In contrast, schools rated acceptable or better in 2011-12 had enrollments of nearly 69 percent non-white students. We rate Patrick’s statement as Mostly True.

pomt-03622	Says only about 250 Texans have been killed in action since 9/11.	false	/texas/statements/2013/may/07/leticia-van-de-putte/van-de-putte-says-about-250-texans-killed-action-9/	Leticia Van de Putte says that thankfully, few Texans stand to benefit from her proposed tax break for surviving spouses of Texans who die in action. The San Antonio Democrat, who chairs the Senate Veteran Affairs and Military Installations Committee, told colleagues on the Senate floor May 1, 2013: "According to Department of Defense data, there would only be about 250 killed in action, who were Texans, since 9/11." Michael Brick, an Associated Press reporter based in Austin, brought her claim to our attention via Twitter, wondering if that tally was low. It was, according to a table of figures emailed to us by Van de Putte spokesman Lee Nichols. The table indicates 588 Texans were killed in action from Oct. 1, 2011, to Jan. 24, 2013. It was prepared by the Defense Manpower Data Center, which is the Department of Defense’s "human resource information source." Some 310 of the Texans were married when they died, the table indicates, while 253 were not married; 24 were divorced; and one had an unknown marital status. By email, Nichols noted that Van de Putte generally focused in her remarks on Texas members of the armed services killed in action with surviving spouses in the state who might benefit from her proposed constitutional amendment, which cleared the Senate and awaits House consideration. Under the proposal, which also would require voter approval to take effect, spouses who have not remarried could be exempt from paying property taxes on their homesteads. Shortly after declaring the 250 figure, Nichols stressed, Van de Putte clarified by saying: "So we’re talking probably about 250 folks who would even qualify for this, and that’s since 9/11." Nichols said Van de Putte gave the incorrect figure due to staff error. By telephone, Bill Wilson, chief of staff for the Senate committee, told us that as Van de Putte spoke, he gave her the 250 figure by drawing from the wrong column on the table. His intent, he said, was to let her know that 310 of the Texans killed in action since 9/11 were married, which is of relevance to the fiscal impact of her proposal. Finally, Defense Department spokeswoman Leslie Hull-Ryde guided us to up-to-date online counts of Americans killed in action, enabling us to confirm that as of May 2, 2013, 588 Texans had been killed in action since Oct. 1, 2011. Those Texans comprised 11 percent of the 5,258 Americans killed in action since 9/11, according to the government figures. Precisely, the government counts indicate, 411 Texans were killed in Operation Iraqi Freedom (which ran through August 2010); 170 in Operation Enduring Freedom (occurring in Afghanistan and other countries); and seven in Operation New Dawn (in Iraq and nearby countries since Sept. 1, 2010)--with all but 11 of the dead being men. According to the information, the deaths occurred from Jan. 4, 2002, through Dec. 24, 2012. We calculated the average age of the victims as 26. (See our breakout, including individual names and other details, here.) Brick, the AP reporter, responded to Nichols’ email on this topic by tweeting a May 2, 2013, update, followed by a confessional tweet: "Related: This reporter once spent weeks gathering string on a story," as in detail, "then spelled Sen.

pomt-13256	Says allegations that he made unwanted sexual advances on a female sheriff’s deputy "were found by two separate judges to not have merit."	false	/california/statements/2016/oct/17/scott-jones/scott-jones-falsely-claims-judges-ruled-allegation/	Republican congressional candidate and Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones continues to face questions about his personal conduct following allegations he made unwanted sexual advances on a 26-year-old female subordinate more than a decade ago. They came to light in court documents in July. Jones has strongly denied the accusations, which his opponent Democratic Congressman Ami Bera has used against him in campaign ads. The two are competing to represent the 7th Congressional District, which includes eastern Sacramento County and the cities of Folsom, Rancho Cordova and Elk Grove. Jones, who has a law degree, has done more than just personally deny the claims. In an August interview with Capital Public Radio, Jones said two judges had determined the allegations have no merit. "These allegations that supposedly happened 13 years ago, but were never brought up until in this lawsuit a year or so ago, were found by two separate judges to not have merit," Jones said. News coverage of the case indicates the claims about sexual misconduct never advanced to trial for procedural reasons, which is far different than Jones’ assertion that they were evaluated and found to have no merit. We decided to fact-check whether any judges found the claims against Jones have "no merit." Claim part of larger lawsuit The accusations about sexual advances are from Tosca Olives, who, beginning as a young sheriff’s deputy, said she had about 30 inappropriate encounters with Jones between 2003 and 2005. Her claims were inserted into a larger lawsuit brought against the Sheriff’s Department by four deputies alleging workplace retaliation, sexual harassment and sexual discrimination by their supervisors. Only the retaliation claim advanced to trial. A jury sided with the deputies on that charge and awarded them nearly $3.6 million. Before the trial started, deputies used Olives’ subpoenaed testimony to support their claims of a hostile work environment based on sexual favoritism. Sacramento Superior Court Judge David I. Brown, however, did not allow the sexual harassment and favoritism claims, including Olives’ supporting testimony, to advance. He did not because the deputies "failed to initially plead the cause of action or raise it with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing," according to a Sacramento Bee fact check. The Bee examined a nearly identical claim from Jones, made in a prepared statement in July, that a judge had found Olives’ allegations have no merit. It labeled Jones’ claim false and described it as "misleading." "Nothing in the court record indicates the judge passed judgment on the merits of Olives’ accusations," the Bee fact check said. Jones’ response We asked the Jones campaign to explain the candidate’s statement. Kyle Macdonald, Jones’ campaign manager, noted that Judge Brown dismissed the charges tied to the Olives testimony before trial. He said in an email that decision "can lead a reasonable person to conclude that the Judge found insufficient merit in them." Once the trial started, Macdonald said a second superior court judge, David DeAlba, ruled Olives could not testify. He described this decision "as close as Sheriff Jones can get to an exoneration in this format." Macdonald added: "In sum, no Judge did - or would ever - say ‘I find no merit to these allegations,’ but each of the Judge's rulings in that regard is as close as it would get, and can reasonably be taken with that meaning." A Bera campaign spokeswoman responded to Jones’ claim saying: "Not advancing to trial is distinct from being dismissed by a judge." Our ruling Republican congressional candidate Scott Jones recently claimed that allegations he made unwanted sexual advances on a young, female sheriff’s deputy "were found by two separate judges to not have merit." News coverage, including a Sacramento Bee fact check, found the allegations by the deputy never advanced to trial for procedural reasons. It also found there’s no evidence in the court record that a judgement was made on the merits of the claims. A spokesman for the Jones campaign acknowledged that no judge has ever stated in court that the claims had no merit. Without any evidence to point to, Jones and his campaign ask the public to make a leap of faith about the candidate’s claim, and interpret what the judges might have been thinking. We can’t make that assumption. We rate Jones’ statement False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-14079	Says Donald Trump said of women, "And you can tell them to go f--- themselves."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/18/priorities-usa-action/priorities-usa-donald-trump-women-ad/	Donald Trump's attitude toward women has been a major issue in the 2016 presidential campaign since Megyn Kelly grilled him about some of his negative comments at the GOP’s first presidential debate. With Trump as the presumptive Republican nominee, Priorities USA, a pro-Hillary Clinton super PAC, has released a commercial called "Speak" showing people — all but one of them a woman — wearing T-shirts with Trump images mouthing some of the comments the billionaire has used when referring to women. The quotes: "You know you could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever." "Does she have a good body? No. Does she have a fat ass? Absolutely." "You like girls that are 5-foot-1? They come up to you-know-where." "If Ivanka weren't my daughter, perhaps I'd be dating her." (with an image a father and daughter) "And you can tell them to go f--- themselves." In the last quote, the expletive is bleeped out, but it’s clear what word the woman in the ad is mouthing. The ad then asks, "Does Donald Trump really speak for you?" Apparently, the "f--- themselves" portion of the ad doesn't speak for Trump either, at least when it comes to referring to women. Our partners at the Political TV Ad Archive helped us identify that Trump's voice in that quote was taken from an Feb. 4, 2016, speech he made in New Hampshire. His comment dealt with businesses leaving the United States, not women. "We're going to bring businesses back. We're going to have businesses that are now in Mexico come back to New Hampshire and you can tell them to go f--- themselves," Trump said. "Because they let you down, and they left." Trump clearly mouths the expletive, but he says the word very softly, if at all. Watch for yourself. When we contacted Priorities USA, spokesman Justin Barasky said, "we never claimed it was a reference to women at all." That ad "wasn't just about Donald Trump's overt sexism. It was actually about how divisive he is and how his character is that of someone who should never be president of the United States," he said. "In no way do we ever claim he was saying that to women. There is no fast one trying to be pulled." However, at the very end, when the announcer asks, "Does Donald Trump really speak for you?" the images of seven women — and no men — flash across the screen. The super PAC said it plans to spend $6 million airing that ad and a companion Trump attack ad in Ohio, Florida, Virginia and Nevada over a three-week period. The second ad focuses exclusively on women's issues. In a news release announcing the ad buy, Priorities USA, said, "Our paid media campaign starts by highlighting (Trump's) divisive views on women." Trump, in a tweet about the ad, complained that he wasn't talking about women in the clip, although he mistakenly said he was referring to China. Actually, that was a mistake, too. The clear context was about businesses that left for places like Mexico. Our ruling Priorities USA, in an anti-Trump ad, quotes the candidate as saying, "And you can tell them to go (bleep) themselves." It comes after multiple comments critical of women. The super PAC says the sound clip wasn't meant to be taken as a reference to women. That, as Trump might say, is a huuuuuuuge stretch. The ad is all about women. It features seven women and two men, only one of whom has a speaking role. All of the mouthed phrases — except the one in question — clearly attack, criticize or make disturbing references to women. The ad offers no indication that the "f--- themselves" line refers to anything but women. In fact, it refers to businesses that left the United States. The statement in the ad represents a ridiculous misrepresentation of what Trump said.

pomt-08833	"I've taken on the federal government and won."	true	/florida/statements/2010/aug/11/jeff-kottkamp/kottkamp-took-federal-government-court-and-won-he-/	Lt. Gov. Jeff Kottkamp, a Republican running for attorney general, is trying to push back against criticisms that he's a politician first and lawyer second by highlighting his success in the courtroom. At a July 31, 2010, debate with GOP rivals Holly Benson and Pam Bondi, Kottkamp said that he'd put his legal experience up against anyone running. Then he offered his proof. "I've taken on the federal government," Kottkamp said. "And won." We wanted to see if Kottkamp is accurately describing his legal career. According to the Florida Constitution, the state attorney general must have been a member of the bar of Florida for the preceding five years. That's a standard Kottkamp must, and does, meet. Kottkamp attended the University of Florida College of Law and received his Juris Doctor degree in 1987. He clerked for U.S. District Court Judge Joe Eaton and U.S. District Court Judge Sidney Aronovitz. From 1991-2005, he was a shareholder in the Fort Myers firm of Henderson, Franklin, Starnes & Holt, and before becoming lieutenant governor, he spent a brief time as a partner at Morgan & Morgan. Kottkamp remains a member in good standing with the Florida Bar. Kottkamp's campaign pointed us to case from the 1990s to back up his claim. What follows is an account cobbled together from court documents of the case, Robert B. Reich vs. John C. Davis, P.A. In that case Kottkamp represented John C. Davis, a Fort Myers Beach accountant who was sued by the U.S. Department of Labor for firing two employees. Darlene Smiley and Cynthia Fellows claimed that they were terminated for speaking up about not getting paid overtime. Davis paid overtime during tax season -- roughly January to April -- but offered only compensation time the rest of the year, Smiley and Fellows said. When Smiley asked Davis to pay her the money she was entitled in the fall of 1986, Davis refused. So Smiley complained to the Department of Labor. Investigators interviewed both Smiley and Fellows and determined Davis needed to pay. He did, and then promptly fired both Smiley and Fellows. In court, the Labor Department claimed that Davis violated the Fair Labor Standards Act and argued that the two women should be offered their jobs back. Davis, through his attorney Kottkamp, said that while the overtime controversy was one of the reasons Smiley and Fellows were fired, they would have been fired anyway, because of poor work habits and poor work product. In a 1993 ruling, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida sided with Davis, saying that Smiley and Fellows were not fired because they complained about the overtime. The district court's ruling actually was vacated on appeal in 1995 because the appellate court determined that the complaints were a reason the women were fired. But the appellate court said that as long the complaints were not the only reason, Davis acted lawfully. The case returned to district court and quickly was dismissed, giving Kottkamp the victory he claims over the feds. Kottkamp said during a televised debate that he has taken on the federal government as a lawyer and won. In the 1990s, Kottkamp represented an accountant who was sued by the U.S. Department of Labor for allegedly violating the Fair Labor Standards Act. Kottkamp successfully argued that the man fired two employees legally. For that, we rate his claim True.	None	Jeff Kottkamp	None	None	None	2010-08-11T17:56:22	2010-07-31	['None']
pomt-01104	The "average taxpayer will see the equivalent of a 2 percent pay raise as a result of low fuel prices."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2015/jan/10/glenn-hegar/glenn-hegar-says-benefit-lower-gas-prices-equivale/	A reader noted Republican Glenn Hegar’s upbeat comments about plummeting oil prices and requested a fact check. Hegar, the former state senator elected Texas state comptroller in 2014, told reporters early this year there are benefits to falling oil prices. "Lower fuel costs should reduce the price of importing goods, which is great for consumers and, ultimately, our economy," Hegar said, according to an Austin American-Statesman news story. "In fact, the average taxpayer will see the equivalent of a 2 percent pay raise as a result of low fuel prices." The same story noted the price of oil had fallen about 50 percent since June 2014 to just more than $50 a barrel. And are lower fuel prices equivalent to a 2 percent pay raise for taxpayers? By email, Hegar spokesman Chris Bryan said Hegar drew that percentage from a December 2014 news story in the Economist magazine. The story said, in part: "Cheaper oil should act like a shot of adrenalin to global growth. A $40 price cut shifts some $1.3 trillion from producers to consumers. The typical American motorist, who spent $3,000 in 2013 at the pumps, might be $800 a year better off—equivalent to a 2% pay rise." The magazine didn’t engage with our inquiry about how its figures were worked up. We went on to query James Hamilton, a University of California, San Diego, economist quoted by the Wall Street Journal in November 2014 saying lower gas prices "relative to the average of the past three years will in effect put an extra $108 billion into U.S. consumers’ pockets, generating a nearly 0.8 percent increase in disposable personal income." By email, Hamilton pointed us to his Dec. 21, 2014, blog post stating: "The average U.S. retail price of gasoline right now is about $2.40 a gallon. Last year," in 2013, "American consumers and businesses bought 135 billion gallons of gasoline," per the U.S. Energy Information Administration, at an average price of $3.60 a gallon, he wrote. Hamilton wrote: "If gasoline prices stay where they are and if we buy the same number of gallons of gasoline this year as last, that leaves us with an additional $160 billion to spend over the course of the year on other items. If we restate the total savings for U.S. consumers and businesses in terms of the 116 million U.S. households, that works out to almost $1,400 per household." We checked his bottom-line figure—$1,400 per household—and compared it to what the U.S. Census Bureau estimates to have been the median household income for the U.S. and Texas, respectively, from 2009 through 2013. In Texas, the estimated $1,400 in unspent money shakes out to a 2.7 percent increase on the median income of $51,900. Nationally, it would amount to a 2.6 percent increase from the median household income of $53,046. Also, EIA spokesman Jonathan Cogan noted by email that in December 2014, the agency predicted the average U.S. household would spend about $550 less on gasoline in 2015 than in 2014 due to falling gas prices and more fuel-efficient cars and trucks—which would be 1 percent of the median household income in Texas. Our ruling Hegar said the "average taxpayer will see the equivalent of a 2 percent pay raise as a result of low fuel prices." Provided gas prices don’t go back up, that percentage seems in the ballpark for how much Texans could save on gas compared to what they spent, though it's also possible to get to higher and lower projections.

pomt-07120	"The tax on job creating businesses is 35 percent in the United States, second worst in the entire world."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2011/jun/18/george-allen/george-allen-says-us-corporate-tax-rate-second-hig/	Republican Senate candidate George Allen recently complained that corporate taxes are too high and discourage economic expansion. "The tax on job-creating businesses in the United States is 35 percent, second worst in the entire world," he said during a June 14 news conference at which he unveiled his Blueprint for America’s Comeback.. We wondered if the U.S. really is No.2 in the world when it comes to high corporate taxes and asked for the source of Allen’s information. Katie Wright, spokeswoman for Allen’s campaign, pointed to a March 8, 2011, report from the right-leaning Tax Foundation. It indeed showed that the U.S. had the second highest total corporate tax rate among industrialized and emerging nations. Only Japan placed higher levies on business profits. But taxes are a complicated subject, and Allen’s claim needs elaboration. Eric Toder, co-director of the Urban Institute-Brookings Tax Policy Center, noted most corporate income is taxed at the top U.S. federal rate of 35 percent, which Allen cited. The tax applies to American companies doing business here and abroad as well as to profits earned in the U.S. by affiliates of foreign companies. Allen understates his argument when he says the 35 percent federal corporate tax rate is the second highest in the world. Actually, it outstrips Japan and is the highest national rate among nearly three dozen industrialized democracies, according to 2011 data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. But national tax rates on companies don’t tell the whole story. When looking at how the U.S. corporate tax liability compares to other countries, analysts usually examine a combination of federal and state corporate income tax rates. By that measure, the combined average corporate tax rate in the U.S. is 39.2 percent this year, according to the OECD. Among industrialized democracies, only Japan’s combined corporate rate of 39.5 percent is higher. Japan had planned to lower its corporate tax rate by 5 percent on April 1. But it delayed making the cut after a disastrous earthquake and tsunami struck in March. The OECD report only discusses statutory corporate tax rates. It does not address deductions and credits companies can claim in various countries to lower their liabilities. These loopholes produce an "effective tax rate" - the percentage of profits companies actually pay in levies. The World Bank published a report last November containing the effective corporate tax rates of 183 nations. The U.S. had an effective corporate tax rate of 27.6 percent, according to the study, which is still pretty high. Among larger international economies, only Japan, New Zealand and Thailand had higher effective tax rates on corporate profits. Allen, during his news conference, said he would like to lower the 35 percent national corporate tax rate to 20 percent and eliminate loopholes. Let’s sum up: Allen said the U.S. corporate income tax of 35 percent is the second highest in the world. The national rate of 35 percent is actually the highest among democratic industrial nations. The U.S. combined corporate tax rate -- the average total of state and national levies on business profits -- is 39.2 and ranks second among industrialized democracies. So Allen is a smidgen off on tax rates, rankings and definitions. We rate his claim Mostly True.	None	George Allen	None	None	None	2011-06-18T07:00:00	2011-06-14	['United_States']
pomt-08935	Twenty-two million jobs were created during Clinton’s two terms but only 3 million during Bush’s.	true	/ohio/statements/2010/jul/25/sherrod-brown/sherrod-brown-touts-job-grown-during-clinton-presi/	Politicians can slice and dice monthly job reports expertly, a useful skill for scoring economic talking points. Include a few months’ worth of job losses here, exclude some job gains there, or do it in reverse, and pretty soon it’s all some scoundrel’s fault. (Never mind whom that scoundrel is.) So U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown caught our attention when he took a broader historical look while appearing July 14 on Rachel Maddow’s program on MSNBC. "We saw jobs created, 22 million in the Clinton years," said Brown, a Democrat who’s not up for reelection until 2012. "Because they were responsible about cutting taxes selectively and increasing taxes selectively and they were responsible about what government programs they formed and they dismantled. Twenty-two million jobs created and incomes went up in those eight years for the average American. And in the next eight years, the eight Bush years, only 3 million jobs created and that wasn`t even enough to keep up with population growth." The quantitative claims seemed worth checking out, and in doing so we found a surprise: Brown is wrong – but not in a way he’ll likely mind. No fan of President George W. Bush, Brown grossly understated the poor job growth that occurred on Bush’s watch. The comparison should have been this: Job growth through Clinton two terms was 22.7 million. Through Bush’s two terms, it was 1.1 million. Brown isn’t alone in making this error. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee used the 3 million figure in a news release on July 20 when trying to use Bush’s record on jobs as a weapon against one of his former top aides, Rob Portman. Portman is the Republican in the U.S. Senate race to succeed George Voinovich, who is retiring. Brown’s office wasn’t sure where the senator got his figures, but we did some tracing and concluded it probably came from a Wall Street Journal online story of Jan. 9, 2009. That’s where the Democratic committee says it got its numbers, too. The Wall Street Journal examined net job growth for more than half a century and declared that Bush had the "worst track record on record." That doesn’t mean it’s the worst ever. It’s just the worst since the Labor Department started keeping payroll records in 1939. Said the Journal: "The Bush administration created about three million jobs (net) over its eight years, a fraction of the 23 million jobs created under President Bill Clinton’s administration and only slightly better than President George H.W. Bush did in his four years in office." We wanted to look at those numbers ourselves, so we turned to the Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics, or BLS. Getting guidance on the data from BLS and using Excel spreadsheets, we discovered not only that Brown and the Democrats have been wrong, but also why. It was a matter of timing. BLS had only preliminary data on Bush’s final performance at the close of his second term, when the Wall Street Journal was doing its story. BLS subsequently updated the data. It turned out that things were way worse than the preliminary numbers showed. We shared this assessment with the Journal reporter, who agreed. It’s not a matter of whose numbers were better. It’s a matter of what was known and when. You, too, can do the math. The jobs numbers are based on a monthly survey of employers for the 12th of each month, but the initial reports are revised as more employers complete their survey over the following couple of months. A fuller census of employment and wages is conducted quarterly and is considered more accurate, so BLS eventually adjusts the monthly numbers to reflect that accuracy. Here are the latest numbers: Number of jobs as of January, 1993, a week before Clinton took office: 109.725 million. Number of jobs as of Jan. 2001, a week before Clinton left office: 132.469 million Net Gain under Clinton: 22.7 million jobs. Now for Bush, who succeeded Clinton in the White House. As already noted, the nation had 132.469 million jobs as he was taking office. Number of jobs on Jan. 12, 2009, a week before Bush left office: 133.549 million. Net gain under Bush: 1.08 million jobs. OK, but what about Brown’s claim that incomes went up under Clinton? The numbers bear this out, too. BLS data, adjusted for inflation, show that average weekly wages grew by 21 percent from the start of Clinton’s first term to the end of his second term. They grew by only 2 percent under Bush’s two terms. Is it fair to compare job growth under these presidents? Just in case we were missing some context – because these numbers seemed to turn conventional wisdom of its head -- we ran this by Dan Mitchell, an economist and fan of fiscal restraint who works as a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, a libertarian-oriented think tank. Mitchell said he didn’t find the numbers surprising. Luck and the economic cycle played a role in both presidencies, but the officeholders’ policies played bigger roles, he said. Citing free-trade agreements, welfare reform and deregulation in the telecommunications and agriculture industries, Mitchell said that Clinton’s economic policies were actually geared more to free markets than Bush’s, and the results speak for themselves. But that’s for others to argue. Bush, while insisting on tax cuts, faced a national security crisis unparalleled in the last half-century, and his response – including wars in Iraq and Afghanistan – had serious economic consequences. Political values, including those of Sen. Brown, shape the debate on whether the president took the right or wrong approach. As for us, we’re sticking to the factual claims. Brown’s numbers on Bush were off, but his point was right on target. We rate his statement True. Comment on this item.

pomt-04663	"$500 billion of the extension of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy goes to 120,000 families."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/sep/09/joe-biden/biden-says-500-billion-bush-tax-cuts-wealthy-would/	Vice President Joe Biden moves into high-dudgeon mode when sharing his view that Republican budget cuts would harm average Americans. He was in that zone during swing-state stops after the Republican National Convention, shouting out this line of attack at a Green Bay campaign rally on Sept. 2, 2012. "They didn’t tell you why they are eviscerating all these efforts to help the working and middle class people of America," Biden said. "They are doing it all in the service of massive tax cuts for the very wealthy … $500 billion of the extension of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy goes to 120,000 families. Hear what I just said! One-half trillion dollars will go to 120,000 American families!" Let’s examine Biden’s math and his characterization of the tax cuts enacted during Republican George W. Bush’s two-term presidency. The Bush tax cuts The Bush tax cuts, mostly in 2001 and 2003, lowered federal income tax rates at all levels, decreased the marriage penalty, lowered taxes on capital gains and dividends, boosted the child tax credit and phased out restrictions on how much higher-income people could deduct in mortgage interest and personal exemptions. Those cuts were set to expire in 2010, but President Barack Obama and Congress agreed to extend them until Jan. 1, 2013. Going forward, Obama thinks the cuts should stay in place for 98 percent of taxpayers, but wants to end them on income over $250,000 earned by couples or income over $200,000 for individuals. Republicans, including Romney, want to make all the cuts permanent -- and that’s what drew Biden’s ire. Biden’s claim What about Biden’s half-trillion dollar claim? His campaign said he based it on 10-year projections by White House budget officials, and private studies. Federal budgets typically look ahead 10 years. Biden took a budget projection of $968 billion in tax savings, based on the cuts expiring for the top 2 percent. Then he determined that, within that group, the top 0.1 percent includes about 120,000 families -- and got 55 percent of that $968 million in tax savings. The math comes out to $532 billion for those families -- the "half trillion" Biden shouted about. Biden got the 55 percent and the 120,000 figures from two studies by the independent Tax Policy Center, a project of the Brookings Institution and Urban Institute that is a primary source of detailed reports on tax plans offered by elected officials and candidates. One of the studies said those 120,000 taxpayers have an average annual income of $8.4 million. The vice president’s methodology got a thumbs down from Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, but a thumbs up from Andrew Fieldhouse, the federal budget policy analyst at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank. We asked both -- and a third expert, from the business-backed Tax Foundation -- to take their own look at the slice of tax benefits for 120,000 families at the top of the income range. And the Romney campaign offered up its own figures. Here’s what we learned: -- Williams did a back-of-the-envelope calculation based on Tax Policy Center data and estimated the 120,000 families would save more than $400 billion but less than $600 billion over 10 years if the Bush cuts were extended. He called that a "best guess." -- Fieldhouse, of the Economic Policy Institute, used Tax Policy Center data and came up with $523-$570 billion, with the caveat that there are some limitations to the data and complicating factors. -- William McBride, chief economist at the Tax Foundation, called Biden’s number "plausible" but considers the Tax Policy Center model too limited. "The economy is much more integrated than they pretend, so tax cuts ‘for the rich’ or ‘for the poor’ are really tax cuts for the private sector ultimately in that the money flows back and forth through multiple transactions," he said. Meanwhile, Romney campaign spokesman Darrel Ng said they came up with $407 billion, based on another set of data from the same source. Williams said the Romney campaign number was from outdated figures, but in the ballpark of other estimates. So, there’s a basis for Biden’s $500 billion figure, with the footnote that the numbers are unofficial and somewhat rough. Let’s turn to the VP’s view that the Bush tax cuts were "for the wealthy." One way to judge that is who would benefit if they were permanently extended. The benefits of the reduced capital gains rates and dividends rate, and the cuts in top income tax rates, skew heavily in favor of higher earners, the Congressional Research Service found in a December 2010 study. But the marriage penalty change and cuts in the lowest three income tax rates benefit taxpayers of all incomes, that study showed. The expanded child tax credit helps all but the top fifth of earners. Overall, the top fifth of earners got 65 percent of the savings from the Bush cuts as a whole, according to a Tax Policy Center study of the cuts’ impact as of 2010. In contrast, the three-fifths bunched in the middle-income tiers got 34 percent. The top 0.1 percent -- the group Biden referred to -- got 19.7 percent of the savings. The same trend held for the effect on tax rates. The upper 20 percent saw a much greater reduction in their tax rate than did the lower tiers. The takeaway from all of that: the Bush cuts were not just "for the wealthy," but benefited higher earners more than people in lower income tiers. One more note: Biden is taking just one point from Romney’s tax plan when he tosses out numbers. Romney also wants to close off or limit some tax breaks. "If Romney fulfills all of his tax promises, the rich would save relatively little," Williams wrote to us.

pomt-07886	"Ten retired nuns were barred from voting in the 2008 Indiana Democratic primary."	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/feb/05/leticia-van-de-putte/texas-sen-leticia-van-de-putte-says-10-nuns-indian/	Battling a proposal requiring Texas voters to present photo IDs at the polls, state Sen. Leticia Van de Putte suggested that Indiana’s photo-ID law had disenfranchised 10 elderly nuns. In remarks on the Senate floor, Van de Putte, D-San Antonio, said Jan. 25: "In South Bend, Indiana, 10 retired nuns were barred from voting in the 2008 Indiana Democratic primary. Some of them were in their 80s and 90s. ... These nuns were not able to (vote) because they did not have an ID." The Texas legislation soon cleared the Senate. Still, to quote Van de Putte, we wondered: "What happened to these nuns?" Responding to Van de Putte’s claim was Jerry Bonnet, chief legal counsel for the Indiana secretary of state, who was on the Senate floor to give testimony about Indiana’s experience with its law requiring that voters at the polls have a photo ID that was issued by the state or federal government. "It’s my understanding ... the nuns did have passports; they did have a form of ID that was acceptable," Bonnet said. "But they refused to present that. They were eligible for other exceptions under the law, absentee voting exceptions, and it was really a media event because the media had been brought to the scene before. And they also refused to vote provisionally." Under Indiana’s law, upheld in state and federal courts since taking effect in 2005, a voter without an acceptable photo ID may cast a provisional ballot that will be counted if the person presents authorities with acceptable identification within 10 days. According to the Indiana secretary of state’s website, an Indiana driver license, state photo ID, military ID or U.S. passport is usually sufficient. The law also allows some voters — including those at least 65 years old — to cast absentee ballots by mail. A photo ID is not required in those instances. Answering our request for information on the nuns, Van de Putte spokeswoman Sarah Gomez pointed us to two May 2008 news articles, including one by The Associated Press, which reported that nuns from Saint Mary’s Convent in South Bend "were turned away from a polling place by a fellow nun because they didn’t have state or federal identification bearing a photograph." They had been told they would need such an ID to vote, the article says, but "the nuns, all in their 80s or 90s, didn’t get one but came to the precinct anyway." Some showed up with outdated passports, according to the story. During the Senate hearing, Van de Putte balked at Bonnet’s suggestion that the dust-up was a media event: "You’re saying that this was orchestrated by these devious nuns to actually (provoke) Indiana law and really, they intended to mess you up purposefully?" "Yes," Bonnet said. Bonnet later told us that he’d learned from media reports that some of the nuns toted passports to the polling place. However, he wrote in a Jan. 27 letter to Van de Putte that the nuns "may not have had valid photo IDs." May not or did not? In a Feb. 3 e-mail to us, Bonnet said his "understanding" was that some of the nuns "presented themselves for in-person voting" without any acceptable ID. Bonnet also noted other ways that any of the nuns could have voted without showing a photo ID, including by casting a provisional ballot at the polling place and signing a document at the county election office within 10 days swearing that she was indigent. Indigency is one exception to Indiana’s photo-ID requirement. Bonnet also said the nuns were entitled to receive a free state-issued photo ID. Graig Lubsen, deputy communications director for the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles, told us that on election day Hoosiers can go to one of the agency’s offices to obtain a temporary version of the ID that can be used at the polls. At the time of the 2008 primary, Indiana residents seeking the state IDs were required to show four different documents, including at least one "primary" document such as a birth certificate or a passport, plus proof of a Social Security number and Indiana residency. Asked why the nuns had not cast provisional ballots, Bonnet cited the AP story, which quotes Sister Julie McGuire, a poll worker, saying that it would be impossible to get the nuns to a state motor vehicle office within the 10-day deadline. "You have to remember that some of these ladies don't walk well," McGuire was quoted as saying. "They're in wheelchairs or on walkers or electric carts." The day after the May 6 primary, McGuire told the South Bend Tribune: "They wanted to vote. It was heartbreaking for all of us." The Tribune story said a request to interview some of the nuns was turned down. Bonnet told us that the state did not initially investigate the incident because no complaint was filed. However, he said it reappeared in a lawsuit filed in state court in June 2008 challenging Indiana’s voter ID law, which was upheld last year by the Indiana Supreme Court. In their suit, the League of Women Voters of Indiana said the photo ID law had prevented "an indeterminate number of citizens … from casting a vote that counts." The incident involving the Saint Mary’s nuns was among the examples. In its June 30 opinion, the Indiana Supreme Court stated that none of the allegations made by the league "creates any basis for a declaration that the state may not require any voters to identify themselves at the polls using photo ID. Some of these allegations, if substantiated, may entitle specific voters to more tailored relief, but none has been sought in the plaintiffs' complaint." Next, we reached Amy Smessaert, a spokeswoman for the convent, who told us in an e-mail that 10 nuns in their 80s and 90s tried to vote in the May 2008 primary. She said none had "a valid government-issued picture ID." The nuns knew about the ID law, Smessaert said, but "a few didn’t understand that their ID did not meet the requirements." She said one nun had an expired passport that was not accepted. Smessaert said she doesn’t know what kinds of ID the other nuns brought because the convent didn’t keep a record of that. More than 100 retired nuns were eligible to vote, she said, and many had done so earlier by absentee mail-in ballot. Smessaert said that while "the option to vote by provisional ballot was available" to the sisters who lacked acceptable ID, none chose to do so. She said she didn’t know why. "The sisters are U.S. citizens and have the right to vote," she said. "The manner in which each sister votes is a personal decision." "This situation was in no way a publicity stunt nor was there anything devious about it," she said. Smessaert said that several of the nuns who were unable to vote have since died and that the others couldn’t be interviewed because of health reasons. So, were the nuns barred from voting, as Van de Putte says? According to media reports and a spokeswoman for Saint Mary’s convent, the elderly nuns were barred from casting a regular ballot because they lacked proper identification. But they were not barred from voting in another way, such as casting provisional ballots — though their votes wouldn’t have counted unless the sisters took additional steps to meet state qualifications. We rate Van de Putte’s statement as Half True.	None	Leticia Van de Putte	None	None	None	2011-02-05T06:00:00	2011-01-25	['Indiana']
pomt-00077	"Household income among Hispanic Americans has just set a new record high."	true	/west-virginia/statements/2018/nov/01/donald-trump/hispanic-household-income-record-high-donald-trump/	At a rally in Wheeling, W.Va, on Sept. 29, President Donald Trump touted economic advancement by Hispanic Americans. "Household income among Hispanic Americans has just set a new record high," Trump told the crowd. Is that correct? We took a closer look. Every year, the U.S. Census Bureau releases its annual Income and Poverty Report. The 2017 statistics, released in September 2018, contained the following chart showing median household income by race from 1967 to 2017. The chart shows that the 2017 median household income for Hispanic-Americans of any race -- $50,486 when adjusted for inflation -- was higher than it was for any previous year. Between 2010 and 2017, inflation-adjusted incomes for Hispanic households rose by about one-third. The rise in Hispanic income wasn’t unusual -- as the chart indicates, incomes have risen consistently for every racial and ethnic group since the recovery from the Great Recession began, with the exception of a recent downturn for Asian-Americans.. The timing of the income rise for Hispanic households means that this is not an accomplishment only for the Trump administration. Hispanic incomes began rising in 2011 and continued to increase for most of President Barack Obama’s administration. They have continued that rise under Trump. Our ruling Trump said that "household income among Hispanic Americans has just set a new record high." Census Bureau data confirms a new record high for inflation-adjusted, Hispanic household income in 2017, the most recent year for which data is available. This continues a rise that began under Obama, but Trump did not specifically claim credit, so we rate the statement True.

pomt-15306	"If you're from Syria and you're a Christian, you cannot come into this country" as a refugee.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/20/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-if-youre-syria-and-christianyou-/	Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been making many bold statements recently, but one that caught a PolitiFact reader’s eye involved religion and the admittance of refugees into the United States. "If you're from Syria and you're a Christian, you cannot come into this country, and they're the ones that are being decimated. If you are Islamic ... it's hard to believe, you can come in so easily," Trump said in a speech in Las Vegas on July 11, 2015. "In fact, it's one of our main groups of people that are coming in. Now, not that we should discriminate against one or the other, but if you are Christian, you cannot get into the country. You cannot get into the country." Trump has made similar arguments before, such as in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network in June. So we decided to see if Trump’s claim was accurate. Neither Trump nor the White House responded to an inquiry, but we did communicate with representatives of a range of refugee-assistance groups and scholars who study the issue. The most that can be said for Trump’s claim is that there is a sizable difference between the number of Muslims and the number of Christians that have come into the United States as refugees so far. Between Oct. 1, 2014, and July 17, 2015, according to federal data, 859 Sunni Muslims, five Shiite Muslims and 42 people identified only as "Muslim" arrived in the United States as refugees from Syria, for a total of 906. Meanwhile, 28 Christians arrived from Syria. (Other arrivals included two atheists, two of the Baha'i faith and one with no stated religion.) So, on its face, Trump’s claim that you "cannot come into this country" if you’re a Christian from Syria is wrong. Still, this data finds that 96 percent of the refugee arrivals from Syria were Muslim, compared to only about 3 percent who were Christian. However, it’s important to keep in mind that the population of Syria is overwhelmingly Muslim to start with. The CIA World Fact Book says Syria’s population is 87 percent Muslim and 10 percent Christian. In other words, the refugee numbers are a bit more heavily Muslim and a bit less Christian than the population at large, but not dramatically so. "While there may be higher numbers of Muslims from Syria who have come to the U.S. than Christians, this is not reflective of any policy making it easier for Muslims and harder for Christians," said Shaina Ward, associate director of Refugee Council USA. Ward noted that the the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees does most of the initial screening of refugees seeking resettlement. UNHCR, she said, "identifies and refers the most vulnerable, whoever they are," using a variety of criteria in addition to religion More importantly, there is no evidence whatsoever for the most explosive element of Trump’s charge -- that the U.S. government is discriminating against Christians as a matter of official policy. "The U.S. refugee resettlement program is open to Muslims and Christians, as well as to members of other targeted religious groups," said Jennifer Moore, a law professor at the University of New Mexico. Karen Jacobsen, a professor at Tufts University’s Fletcher School of Law & Diplomacy, agreed, calling Trump’s charge "completely untrue." "The U.S. government does not discriminate on the basis of religion in refugee admission or resettlement, and if you look at refugee admissions by religion over the past 10 years, rather than just at the Syrian refugees in the past few years, there are likely more Christians than Muslims," Jacobsen said. Representatives of three human-rights groups we contacted -- Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the Refugee Council USA -- also agreed that Trump’s accusation is off-base. Geoffrey Mock, the Syrian country specialist for Amnesty International USA, agreed, adding that he has "worked with Christians from Egypt and Syria, so I know they are getting in." Some experts argued that the biggest problem with the refugee flow from Syria is not that it’s discriminatory against Christians, but that the trickle has been so small. In September 2014, the State Department wrote that "the refugee crisis caused by the conflict in Syria is the worst the world has witnessed in a generation, with more than 2.9 million refugees in the region. More than 9 million people need assistance, including 6.5 million displaced inside Syria." Yet the U.S. government, as noted before, has let in a tiny fraction of those numbers -- less than 1,000 in the past nine months, and only about 2,500 prior to August 2014. One reason for the small number of admittances is the long process facing refugees. Once a case is referred from the UNHCR to the United States, a refugee must undergo a security clearance check that could take several rounds, an in-person interview, approval by the Department of Homeland Security, medical screening, a match with a sponsor agency, "cultural orientation" classes, and one final security clearance. The background checks are often particularly complicated for refugees who were forced to flee their homes without the opportunity to gather important paperwork. Given these requirements, Susan Martin, a professor of international migration at Georgetown University, takes issue with the claim by Trump that if you’re a Muslim, "you can come in so easily." "I know from my own research and the literature on resettlement that no one comes in 'easily,’ " she said. "The security checks are very comprehensive and very time consuming. When I was looking at resettlement of Iraqi refugees in Jordan a few years ago, I met with a number of families who had been approved for admission to the United States by the Department of Homeland Security but were awaiting their security checks. Most had been waiting for months, including families with young children who were in need of specialized medical care. I don't think any of them would have characterized the process as easy.’ " A final note: There is one step that the U.S. government could take if it wished. It could give Christian refugees from Syria a leg up on resettlement by granting them status as a "priority 2" or "P-2" class -- "groups of special humanitarian concern identified by the U.S. refugee program," according to the government. P-2 groups have long included Jews, evangelical Christians, and Ukrainian Catholic and Orthodox religious adherents from what used to be the Soviet Union, as well as dissidents from Cuba and a variety of religious minorities in Iran. It also included Vietnamese refugees until 2009 and Bosnian refugees during the 1990s-era civil war. It now includes Iraqis who helped United States military or diplomatic efforts after the Iraq War, as well as certain Burmese, Bhutanese and Congolese refugees. So far, no group from Syria, Christians or otherwise, has been granted this status. Our ruling Trump said that "if you're from Syria and you're a Christian, you cannot come into this country" as a refugee. This is wrong on its face -- a small number of Syrian Christians been admitted as refugees over the past nine months -- and also false in spirit, since there is nothing in the United States’ laws or regulations that discriminates against Christian refugees. We rate the claim False.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2015-07-20T10:00:00	2015-07-11	['Syria']
pomt-03375	"More Americans receive food aid than work in (the) private sector."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/10/allen-west/allen-west-says-more-americans-receive-food-aid-wo/	Former U.S. Rep. Allen West, a staunchly conservative Republican who represented a Florida district for one term, recently sent a tweet that resurrected one of the themes used by Mitt Romney and others during the 2012 presidential campaign -- the idea that there are makers and takers in America. Here’s what West tweeted: "More Americans receive food aid than work in private sector. ‘Fundamental transformation?’ Nope, nation destruction." The tweet linked to an article in the conservative website CNSNews that provided data to support his claim. The CNSNews article cited a report by the inspector general of the Agriculture Department, which operates most federal food-assistance programs, as well as employment data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The inspector general’s report said that "FNS estimates that a total of 101 million people currently participate in at least one of its programs." The CNSNews article compared this figure to BLS data showing that there were "97,180,000 full-time private-sector workers in 2012." However, we see a number of problems with this comparison, and how West framed it. The employment figure is likely higher than 97 million We looked at the BLS figures for April 2013 so we could match them to the most recently available figures for participation in food-assistance programs, which are from that month. According to BLS, 113.6 million Americans had a private-sector job during April 2013. That’s more than the 101 million figure for food assistance. The CNSNews number -- 97 million -- was smaller because it subtracted part-time workers and used 2012 data, neither of which were qualifications made by West. The food-assistance number is likely lower than 101 million For means-tested benefits such as these, it seems plausible that an individual who qualifies for one program may also qualify for another. It would be odd if at least some fraction of children qualifying for a free or reduced-price school breakfast wouldn’t also qualify for a free or reduced-price school lunch, and if some of the these same children didn’t also qualify for food stamps at home. In fact, studying overlap was actually the whole purpose of the inspector general’s report. It concluded that "the potential for overlap and duplication exists" among the department’s nutrition programs. But participation in all of these categories is counted separately. No steps were taken to avoid double- or triple-counting people who receive more than one type of food assistance when the 101 million figure was calculated, an approach confirmed to PolitiFact by Agriculture Department spokeswoman Jessica Milteer. "Many participants in our programs are eligible to take advantage of more than one nutrition assistance program," she said. Here's the breakdown of participation in the food-assistance programs listed on the Agriculture Department’s website: Program Participants Period Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (food stamps) 47,548,694 April 2013 National School Lunch Program 30,839,021 April 2013 School Breakfast Program 13,481,128 April 2013 Food aid for adult and child care 3,535,000 Highest month, fiscal 2012 Summer Food Service 2,347,000 Highest month, fiscal 2012 Women-Infants-Children 2,032,248 April 2013 Indian Reservation Food Program 76,500 All year, fiscal 2012 Commodity Supplemental Food Programs (non-elderly) 17,600 All year, fiscal 2012 Commodity Supplemental Food Programs (elderly) 576,600 All year, fiscal 2012 Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition Program 863,097 All year, fiscal 2011 WIC Farmers' Market Nutrition 1,900,000 All year fiscal 2011 TOTAL 103,216,888 This is quite close to the 101 million cited in the inspector general’s report. If efforts had been taken to weed out overlap between the programs, the figure would be much lower. (Unfortunately, the inspector general’s report didn’t provide an estimate of how much overlap exists.) The comparison isn’t especially enlightening The universe of people who could potentially receive food aid is the entire U.S. population. But the universe of people who could potentially hold a private-sector job consists only of those 16 years old and over. And one could easily make that universe smaller by excluding those who are 16 or 17 (and who are supposed to be in school) or those older than 65 (who have reached retirement age). If you adjust for the differences in the size of these universes, one could easily come to the opposite conclusion than the one West offered. Using the 101 million figure for food aid, which as we noted is likely overstated, means that about 33 percent of the U.S. population receives food assistance. By contrast, about 47 percent of people age 16 and up work in the private sector. If you restrict it to people age 18 to 64, the percentage working in the private sector rises to 59 percent. So, the percentage of working-age people with private-sector jobs is at least twice as high as the percentage of Americans who receive food assistance -- the opposite conclusion to the one West drew. And a final note: The categories of "employed in the private sector" and "receiving food aid" are not mutually exclusive. According to the department, "over 30 percent of (food stamp) households had earnings in 2011, and 41 percent of all (food stamp) participants lived in a household with earnings." Our ruling West tweeted that "more Americans receive food aid than work in (the) private sector." However, the data West used appears to have undercounted the number of people with a private-sector job and overcounted the number of people receiving food aid. In addition, the comparison isn’t really apples to apples. We rate the claim False.	None	Allen West	None	None	None	2013-07-10T16:15:48	2013-07-08	['United_States']
pomt-13616	"I opposed the only multilateral trade deal that came before the Senate while I was there."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/12/hillary-clinton/economic-speech-hillary-clinton-offers-cherry-pick/	During a high-profile speech on the economy in Warren, Mich., Hillary Clinton said that she would stand up for workers hurt by trade agreements -- an issue that her opponent, Donald Trump, has been hitting hard on the campaign trail. "My message to every worker in Michigan and across America is this: I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership," she said. "I oppose it now, I'll oppose it after the election, and I'll oppose it as president. As a senator, I fought to defend New York's manufacturers and steel-makers from unfair Chinese trading practices. And I opposed the only multilateral trade deal that came before the Senate while I was there, because it didn't meet my high bar." We have already given Clinton a Full Flop for switching her view on the Trans-Pacific Partnership from supportive to opposed. Here, we’ll look at whether Clinton is correct to say that she "opposed the only multilateral trade deal that came before the Senate while I was there." The statement glosses over the different types of trade agreements that exist and Clinton's past support for them. Clinton’s trade record As we have previously noted, Clinton’s views on trade have zigzagged somewhat over the years. "Some people are generally pro-trade or anti-trade. She’s case-by-case on trade," said Gene Sperling, director of the National Economic Council in both the Clinton and Obama administrations, to the Washington Post in 2015. As first lady, Clinton spoke favorably in the 1990s and in the early 2000s of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, signed by President Bill Clinton. "Creating a free trade zone in North America — the largest free trade zone in the world — would expand U.S. exports, create jobs and ensure that our economy was reaping the benefits, not the burdens, of globalization. Although unpopular with labor unions, expanding trade opportunities was an important administration goal," she wrote in her 2003 memoir, Living History. As a senator from New York, Clinton had the opportunity to vote on 10 trade deals. She voted no on the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA) and a deal with Andean countries. However -- and this was not reflected in Clinton’s speech -- Clinton actively voted for five bilateral trade deals during her tenure, namely Chile, Singapore, Australia, Morocco, and Oman. She also chose not to object to a unanimous consent vote on a sixth bilateral pact (Bahrain) and she said she supported two others that she never officially cast a vote on (Peru and Jordan) because they came up during her first presidential bid. Here’s a summary of the 10 significant votes taken on trade deals during Clinton’s tenure in the Senate, which is the time frame she referenced in the speech: Year Legislation Clinton’s vote 2002 Trade Act of 2002 (includes Andean countries)* Voted against** 2003 Chile-United States Voted for 2003 Singapore-United States Voted for 2004 Australia-United States Voted for 2004 Morocco-United States Voted for 2005 Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) Voted against 2005 Bahrain-United States Voted for*** 2006 Oman-United States Voted for 2007 Peru-United States Didn’t vote, supported in 2007 2007 Jordan-United States Didn’t vote, supported in 2005 * This deal is not included in the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative’s list of free trade agreements, but contains many free trade provisions. ** This is a vote for "fast track authority" — allowing trade agreement to move through Congress without amendments or filibusters. *** The free trade agreement with Bahrain passed by unanimous consent, not a recorded roll call vote. So, to sum up, Clinton did indeed vote against one multilateral trade bill that came up while she was in the Senate -- CAFTA -- and voted against another bill that could be characterized as a multilateral trade deal, which was the Trade Act of 2002. Seen through this lens, these votes provide support for what she said in her speech. But just outside that lens, the picture gets murkier. Clinton has tailored her claim so narrowly that it obscures the bigger picture. Clinton explained her seemingly inconsistent positions in a 2005 speech to Congress: "The U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement included internationally recognized enforceable labor standards in the text of the agreement. Sadly, DR-CAFTA is a step backward." While separate deals with Chile, Australia and Singapore similarly excluded labor rights standards, Clinton said she "supported these agreements despite these concerns because I believed the agreements would not harm the average working person in those nations." In the meantime, we’ll note that as a presidential candidate in 2008, Clinton had varying opinions on various trade deals, and she changed her position on NAFTA. She called NAFTA "a mistake" and opposed pending deals with South Korea, Colombia and Panama. She reiterated her support for free trade with Peru on the campaign trail. And as secretary of state, Clinton walked back her opposition to deals with South Korea, Colombia and Panama, and helped negotiate them as well as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. As a presidential candidate in 2016, Clinton has reiterated her opposition to CAFTA and flip-flopped on her support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The Clinton campaign told PolitiFact that she has been clear in the past that she's supported some deals and opposed others based on whether they meet certain standards. The campaign also argued that multilateral deals have a broader impact, making those votes the most important. Our ruling Clinton said, "I opposed the only multilateral trade deal that came before the Senate while I was there." Clinton did oppose one multilateral deal (CAFTA) and opposed another that could be characterized as a multilateral deal (the Trade Act of 2002). However, focusing only on multilateral agreements, as Clinton does, obscures her overall voting record on trade pacts while serving in the Senate. When it came to bilateral agreements, Clinton cast votes to support five of them, and she supported -- but never cast a formal vote for -- an additional three. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-08-12T14:23:57	2016-08-11	['None']
pomt-14115	"The market is making this decision. The market has driven down the cost of coal, so you have companies going bankrupt."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/10/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-market-forces-made-coal-compa/	Some coal country voters see Hillary Clinton as a threat, someone who would install regulations that would hurt rather than help the struggling coal industry. But Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner, told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that she thinks it's necessary to move away from fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy, and she wants to do what she can to help current coal mine workers make that transition. "But the market is making this decision," she said May 4. "The market has driven down the cost of coal, so you have companies going bankrupt. So what I'm offering is a $30 billion plan to really revitalize coal country, to provide support for coal miners and their families, and I think that is the least the country owes these brave people." Coal has historically been the country’s primary electricity generator. But several major coal companies have gone bankrupt in recent years, including Arch Coal, Alpha Natural Resources and Peabody Energy. We decided to dig into the question of how much of that change is due solely to market forces, rather than environmental regulation. We talked to coal industry experts who told us that the primary forces working against coal are market-based, notably the growth of natural gas as a cleaner, cheaper alternative. But now that coal is vulnerable, environmental regulations may seal coal’s demise. "Coal has always been able to absorb new regulations," said Robert Godby, a professor and expert in energy economics at the University of Wyoming. "But the impact natural gas has had since the fracking boom has been amazing to watch." He added: "This would all still be happening regardless of regulations." Natural gas is eating coal’s lunch, and the coal companies made a bad bet on Chinese demand. Coal used to generate about 50 percent of electricity in the United States, but now it’s down to about 30 percent. Just in the past couple years, natural gas has begun to displace coal. (In this Energy Information Administration chart, the grey line represents coal, and the orange line represents natural gas.) A recent boom in hydraulic fracturing (fracking) in the United States has dramatically increased the availability of natural gas. Natural gas prices are low, and it produces about half as much carbon. Consequently, demand for natural gas is going up, and demand for coal is going down, and fast. While natural gas is the main threat, a growing demand and diminishing costs for renewable energy, like wind and solar power, also takes away from coal demand, said West Virginia University law professor Patrick McGinley. He added that on top of all this, it’s getting harder to produce cheap coal in the Appalachia region because a century of mining has depleted supply, and so the costs of mining new coal are going up. This is all a huge problem for coal, because electricity is about 90 percent of the coal market, said Andy Roberts, research director for global thermal coal markets at the consulting firm Wood Mackenzie. He said the trend is unlikely to reverse. But it was a big, failed bet on the international coal market that ultimately pushed companies to a point where they couldn’t pay off their debts, forcing them to file for bankruptcy reorganization. About five years ago, the big coal companies — Arch, Alpha and Peabody — took out massive loans to invest in metallurgical coal, a type found in the Appalachia region. They thought fast-growing Asian countries, particularly China, would want the coal to facilitate economic development. But China’s growth slowed, and the demand never materialized. The companies have been unable to pay back their debts on this project, and that’s what sent them into bankruptcy, Godby said. Regulations may make electricity companies apprehensive about investing in coal down the line. This is the best way to think about how environmental regulations affect coal: If you’re an electricity company considering building a new coal-powered plant or rehabilitating an outdated one, you’re already on the fence about whether that’s a good investment, because of the threat of natural gas. But then you remember you might have to face strict carbon emission limitations down the line, which convinces you to go with a natural gas plant instead of a coal plant. Take President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan, a major initiative that would affect coal-powered plants by reducing carbon emissions. It isn’t in effect yet, and it faces court hurdles. Even so, the uncertainty of what kinds of carbon limitations coal plants will face, and the possibility that they could be significant, has already reduced coal plant investment, Roberts said. "So, investment in coal plants is now basically nil," Roberts said. "And when the CPP begins in earnest in 2022, coal demand, already suffering, will more rapidly and inexorably decline." Similarly, the 2015 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards is a federal regulation that has had a significant impact on the coal industry and contributed to coal-powered plant closures. But it’s impossible to tell how much of the changes in the coal market can be attributed solely to the regulations, rather than the regulations plus the market forces. Multiple experts we asked said that so far, it’s primarily been the market putting pressure on coal. But looking toward the future, as coal becomes more vulnerable and environmental rules get bigger, regulations may play a larger role. "Yes, as Secretary Clinton notes, the market is sorting this out," Roberts said. "Competitive natural gas, the ‘market,’ does indeed have something to do with that. But so do the CPP and federal subsidies for renewable generation. The combination of all these elements has been toxic for coal companies and lethal for those with too much debt. In reality, the ‘market’ for coal is partially economic but increasingly regulatory." In October, Appalachian Power President Charles Patton said coal power won’t be able to rebound "with or without the Clean Power Plan" — the economics just don’t make sense. Our ruling Clinton said, "The market is making this decision. The market has driven down the cost of coal, so you have companies going bankrupt." Economic forces on both the national and international markets are the main reason coal’s prominence in the American energy sector is now vulnerable, forcing coal-burning plant closures and several high-profile bankruptcies. For a long time, coal has been impervious to government regulation. But more recently, regulations — a non-economic force — might be the straw that breaks the camel’s back, especially going forward now that coal is on shaky ground. Clinton’s claim is missing this important context, so we rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c44bd88a-1f3a-4aae-8838-67544690874a	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-05-10T12:00:21	2016-05-04	['None']
pomt-02186	"In 2013 we had the largest, the best, private sector job growth we’ve had in this state since the 1990s."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/apr/27/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-2013-job-growth-wisconsin-was-be/	In the wake of formally launching his re-election bid, Gov. Scott Walker is rolling out a new jobs statistic to combat criticism over the pace of Wisconsin’s employment recovery. "You don’t hear this from a lot of the other media outlets out there, and you certainly don’t read about it in most of the newspapers in the state," Walker told conservative talker Jay Weber on Milwaukee’s WISN-AM (1130) April 16, 2014. "In 2013 we had the largest, the best, private sector job growth we’ve had in this state since the 1990s." Now, it’s been well documented that Wisconsin’s private-sector job growth has trailed the national average and Walker is lagging on his promise of adding 250,000 private sector jobs in his first term. Despite all that, did Wisconsin job growth in 2013 outpace gains in every year for nearly the last decade and a half? Digging into the numbers When we asked Walker’s office to provide backup, his spokeswoman Jocelyn Webster pointed to monthly jobs estimates based on government surveys of a small sample of employers. Those numbers showed that 2013’s private job-growth of 39,700 is the highest since 1999’s 55,700. To be sure, those numbers are far less reliable than the job-count data reported in the U.S. Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, which tallies job creation from a census of 96 percent of the nation’s employers. Notably, over the last three years Walker has criticized the monthly numbers as unreliable, arguing for using the quarterly figures. Here, he does the opposite. But the latest figures from the more-reliable quarterly census run only through September 2013, so we think it’s fair game for the governor to use them, though as we shall see they are subject to change. The year-end 2013 figures are expected out in June. Researchers we spoke to said the percentage of growth is a better measure because economies grow over time. By that measure, the 1.66 percent growth in 2013 also was the best since 1999’s 2.37 percent. The numbers didn’t surprise Laura Dresser, who tracks Wisconsin’s employment picture as labor economist and associate director of the Center on Wisconsin Strategy, a nonprofit think tank. Two national recessions bookended the 2000s, Dresser noted, with the one early in the decade spawning the phrase "jobless recovery." Three years (2001 and 2008-09 in the Great Recession) saw big job losses in Wisconsin’s private market. And the state’s job total still hasn’t rebounded to 2007 pre-recession highs. Digging a little deeper There are multiple ways to slice jobs data. So hang with us, there’s a bit of technical job-count speak ahead. Walker’s figures are based on seasonally adjusted data for December each year. Under this counting method, actual changes in job growth are adjusted to account for cyclical economic factors such as weather, vacation periods and holidays. But some researchers prefer to use unadjusted figures, saying the seasonal adjustments are not necessary when comparing year-over-year changes. (The most important thing is to use one or the other method consistently.) The counts can vary significantly. In fact, the unadjusted figures for 2013 show 15,000 fewer jobs created in 2012 than the seasonally adjusted figures. At this point, using unadjusted figures, the 2013 result (24,400 jobs added) trails five years, namely, 2004, 2005, 2010, 2011 and 2012 which ranged from 28,100 to 39,000 jobs added. "If he is talking about actual counts of jobs, this is the number you want to use," Dale Knapp, research director at the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, told us. Others are fine with the seasonally adjusted data that backs up Walker’s claim. It’s frequently used in year-over-year comparisons published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the official scorekeeper on job growth. Seasonally adjusted figures have several advantages and are more familiar to the general public than other types of data, BLS economists told us. The Wisconsin Department of Revenue uses it as well. Dresser, of the Center on Wisconsin Strategy, uses the seasonally adjusted data for annual comparisons, but said the unadjusted data is defensible as well. PolitiFact Wisconsin tracks Walker’s progress on his 250,000 jobs promise in part using seasonally adjusted figures. Our "Walk-O-Meter" includes a footnote that explains we combine the more reliable quarterly census data with the latest monthly survey data to come up with the "best available" up-to-date figures for the current month. In the end, Walker’s claim may have a limited shelf life. That’s because the monthly survey numbers have not gone through final revisions for the fourth quarter of 2013. Those revisions are made based on what happens with the more accurate quarterly-census data, so it is still a bit of a moving target. Based on past changes, the revision -- expected this summer -- could be large. "To know how many jobs were added in 2013, we just have to wait for the (quarterly census) data," said Knapp. Our rating Walker said that "in 2013 we had the largest, the best, private sector job growth we’ve had in this state since the 1990s." The claim is accurate based on the best available data source and using a common method of comparison. But it needs some clarification because the number is not final, so the ranking is subject to change. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2014-04-27T05:00:00	2014-04-16	['None']
pomt-07678	A bill before the Georgia General Assembly would make presidential candidates meet citizenship requirements that are not in the U.S. Constitution.	true	/georgia/statements/2011/mar/09/loren-collins/birther-foe-says-ga-bill-gets-constitution-wrong/	My, how Georgia’s political winds shift. By last Wednesday, 93 state House members had signed on as co-sponsors to Rep. Mark Hatfield’s so-called "birther" bill, which would make presidential and vice presidential candidates prove their citizenship to make the state’s ballot. The next day, more than 20 had crossed their names off the list. Several more did by Friday afternoon. That same day, an op-ed in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution by local attorney and anti-birther blogger Loren Collins took more wind from House Bill 401’s sails. The bill would require presidential candidates to sign an affidavit saying they have never held dual citizenship. This means the bill would create requirements for president that don’t exist in the U.S. Constitution, Collins wrote: "There is not and never has been any constitutional rule mandating that the president ‘has never held dual or multiple citizenship.’ This is pure birther fantasy, a nonexistent bit of pseudo law that an attorney such as Hatfield should know better than to promote." It sounds like the bill has a huge flaw. Is Collins’ claim true? "Birthers" believe in the oft-discredited theory that President Barack Obama is not eligible for office because the Constitution says that a president must be a "natural born citizen." Obama was born in Hawaii, but many birthers think he was born in Kenya. Obama was born to an American mother and Kenyan father. He had Kenyan citizenship and lost it. Kenya’s constitution grants citizenship to the children of Kenyans at birth, but those who are also citizens of other countries lose it at age 23 unless they take certain steps. Obama never took them. We called Collins, author of the blog Barackryphal, who said he voted for Libertarian presidential candidate Bob Barr in 2008, not Obama. He cited the Constitution’s Article II: "No Person except a natural born Citizen . . . shall be eligible to the Office of President." This language does not and should not exclude candidates who are or were dual citizens, Collins argued. Foreign law decided who qualifies for dual citizenship, and foreign law should not decide who is eligible to be U.S. president. We called Hatfield, who does not describe himself as a "birther," but wants more proof that Obama is eligible to be president. Hatfield, a Waycross Republican, said the founders thought that presidents should be born in the United States, their parents should be citizens, and dual citizens should be barred to avoid foreign influence. That’s why the Constitution uses the term "natural born citizen" instead of "citizen." Under Hatfield’s definition, Obama couldn’t be president. Hatfield noted that in 2008, scholars debated whether Republican nominee for president Sen. John McCain was eligible because he was born in the Panama Canal Zone. His father, a Navy officer, was stationed there. We presented Hatfield’s argument to legal experts on U.S. citizenship. They agreed that Hatfield’s concept of "natural born" citizenship makes little, if any, legal sense. "If that [the bill] passes in Georgia’s Statehouse, it will be challenged and it will be struck down as unconstitutional. I am 100 percent confident," said Peter Spiro, a Temple University law professor. Hans von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow with the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Hatfield’s bill contains a dual-citizenship ban that does not exist in the Constitution. "It’s trying to add an additional requirement to the eligibility for president," von Spakovsky said. The concept of "natural born citizen" is more complicated than it seems, scholars said. The founders did not clarify what the term meant, but experts have long interpreted it to refer to those who are U.S. citizens at birth. Scholars agree that the Constitution’s authors intended to block naturalized citizens, or those who became citizens after their birth, from becoming president. But the law has yet to be tested, Spiro noted. The Supreme Court has never ruled on the issue, and no candidate with dual citizenship or who was born outside the country has won the presidency. That’s why scholars debated whether McCain was eligible for office. Since he was not born in a U.S. state, he may not have been a citizen at birth, some argued. But that debate was not about dual citizenship. Emory University professor Polly Price explained. The United States adopted the concept of "natural born citizenship" from the English, Price said. For nearly 180 years before the Constitution was drafted, people were natural born citizens of England if they were born on English soil. This understanding was widely accepted in the U.S. during the colonial period. People born in a colony were considered citizens of that colony, Price said. "It may be that some of the founders intended to include only birth on U.S. soil as their understanding of ‘natural born citizen’, but it certainly would not have included that their parents also had to be U.S. citizens," Price said. Collins is right. HB 401 does create eligibility requirements that aren’t in the Constitution. We rule his claim True.	None	Loren Collins	None	None	None	2011-03-09T06:00:00	2011-03-04	['None']
pomt-02780	"The Walton family, which owns Wal-Mart, controls a fortune equal to the wealth of the bottom 42 percent of Americans combined."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/dec/08/one-wisconsin-now/just-how-wealthy-wal-mart-walton-family/	On Nov. 27, 2013, a Madison-based liberal advocacy group used a mass email to promote protests that were planned against Walmart stores for two days later -- Black Friday. The demonstrations aimed to "expose Wal-Mart’s shameful labor practices and support workers," according to One Wisconsin Now, which then made this claim: "The Walton family, which owns Wal-Mart, controls a fortune equal to the wealth of the bottom 42 percent of Americans combined." That reminded us of a March 2011 claim by filmmaker and liberal activist Michael Moore. He said in a Madison speech that 400 Americans have more wealth than half of all Americans combined, a statement we rated True. Based on online hits, it became one of our most popular fact-checks ever. So we wondered about the Walmart claim. Wealth, not income In the days before and after Black Friday, leaders no less prominent than President Barack Obama and Pope Francis decried the extent of income disparity in the United States and around the world. Obama called the growing income gap a "defining challenge of our time." The pope said that while the earnings of a minority "are growing exponentially, so, too, is the gap separating the majority from the prosperity enjoyed by those happy few." Walmart, of course, is a big target. According to Forbes, as of May 2013 the international retailer had $469 billion in sales and 2.2 million employees, including 1.3 million in the United States. The corporation has been criticized for low wages; and in December 2012, PolitiFact National rated as Mostly True a claim that more Walmart employees are on Medicaid and food stamps than other companies. But let’s be clear up front: Although income and wealth are related, they’re not the same. Wealth is commonly measured in terms of net worth -- the value of a person’s assets minus liabilities. So, things like savings and retirement accounts, minus what is owed on a home mortgage, credit cards, etc. That means a person with heavy debt can have little wealth, or negative wealth, even while earning a six-figure income. One more point before we get to the wealth figures. Walmart was founded by the late Sam Walton, who opened the first store in Arkansas in 1962. Walmart incorporated in 1969 and became a publicly traded company a year later. So, Wal-Mart is not family owned, but rather owned by its stockholders; on the other hand, according to Bloomberg and other news reports, the Walton family members still have control of the company, owning about half of the shares. Group's evidence Scot Ross, One Wisconsin Now's executive director, told us his evidence to back his group’s claim is a July 2012 article by economist Josh Bivens, research and policy director of the liberal Economics Policy Institute in Washington, D.C. Bivens wrote that in 2010, the wealth of six Walton family heirs was $89.5 billion, 22 percent higher than in 2007. Meanwhile, the median wealth of American families in 2010 was $77,300, nearly 39 percent lower than three years earlier. (Median wealth refers to the American family that is exactly wealthier than half of all families and less wealthy than half.) As for measuring one against the other, Bivens said the Walton family wealth in 2010 was as large as the wealth of the bottom 48.8 million families in the United States, or 41.5 percent of all American families. Rounded up, 41.5 percent would be 42 percent, the figure One Wisconsin Now claims. But let's keep shopping around a little. Similar claim It turns out that a statement nearly identical to the one made by One Wisconsin Now was uttered in July 2012 by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with Democrats. Sanders said the Walton family owns "more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of America," a claim PolitiFact National rated True. Our colleagues found that Sylvia Allegretto, a labor economist at the University of California, Berkeley, compared the Waltons’ cumulative net worth with that of the overall population, as cited in the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances. That survey was published in August 2012. Allegretto found that the Waltons’ wealth in 2010 was valued at $89.5 billion -- equal to the entire bottom 41.5 percent of American families. The 2010 figures are the latest available for doing comparisons with the net worth of the overall population. But we found, using the Forbes 400 list for 2013, that the wealth of six of Sam Walton’s descendants has continued to grow. Here are their rankings and their wealth: No. 6 Christy Walton (daughter-in-law), $35.4 billion No. 7: Jim Walton (son), $33.8 billion No. 8: Alice Walton (daughter), $33.5 billion No. 9: S. Robson Walton (son), $33.3 billion No. 95: Ann Walton Kroenke (niece), $4.7 billion No. 110: Nancy Walton Laurie (niece), $4 billion Total Walton family wealth: $144.7 billion. A note before we close: Allegretto told us the housing crisis is a key reason that the gap between the Walton family wealth and the wealth of other American families has grown. More Americans were left with "negative wealth" because they lost their biggest asset -- their home -- and often significant amounts of their savings, as well, she said. Our rating One Wisconsin Now wrote: "The Walton family, which owns Wal-Mart, controls a fortune equal to the wealth of the bottom 42 percent of Americans combined." For comparison purposes, the latest data available, for 2010, the figure is 41.5 percent. We rate the statement True. To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's website.

pomt-09000	Says that President Obama said if Congress passed the economic stimulus bill, "we would have unemployment at 8 percent and no higher. And it went higher."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/13/george-will/will-obama-said-stimulus-would-cap-unemployment-8-/	On ABC's This Week on July 11, 2010, host Jake Tapper played a video of a recent speech by President Barack Obama in which he mocked Republicans for "peddling the same old snake oil that they've been peddling for years." Tapper said it appeared Obama was trying to frame the midterm elections as a choice between Democrats and Republicans rather than a referendum on the administration. Tapper asked conservative columnist George Will if he thought Obama's strategy would work. "No," Will said, "because he (Obama) is an expert on snake oil. This is the man who said if we pass the $767 billion stimulus bill -- which it turns out cost $862 billion, a $95 billion oops -- we would have unemployment at 8 percent and no higher. And it went higher." This is a claim with staying power. In fact, we first dealt with a similar claim a little more than a year ago when House Republican Whip Eric Cantor said, "We were promised. The president said we would keep unemployment under 8.5 percent (if the stimulus passed)." Since then, it has become frequent conservative talking point -- cited repeatedly by Fox's Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck and others. So we thought it was worth revisiting. First, we could find no instance of anyone in the administration directly making such a public pledge. Rather, it comes via a Jan. 9, 2009, report called "The Job Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan" from Christina Romer, chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, the vice president's top economic adviser. Their report projected that the stimulus plan proposed by Obama would create 3 million to 4 million jobs by the end of 2010. The report also included a chart predicting unemployment rates with and without the stimulus. Without the stimulus (the baseline), unemployment was projected to hit about 8.5 percent in 2009 and then continue rising to a peak of about 9 percent in 2010. With the stimulus, they predicted the unemployment rate would peak at just under 8 percent in 2009. As Will rightly noted, it went higher. The unemployment rate peaked around 10 percent in late 2009 and is now around 9.5 percent. And Will is also right that the cost of the stimulus rose dramatically. But what we saw from the administration in January 2009 was a projection, not a promise. And it was a projection that came with heavy disclaimers. "It should be understood that all of the estimates presented in this memo are subject to significant margins of error," the report states. "There is the more fundamental uncertainty that comes with any estimate of the effects of a program. Our estimates of economic relationships and rules of thumb are derived from historical experience and so will not apply exactly in any given episode. Furthermore, the uncertainty is surely higher than normal now because the current recession is unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity." There's also a footnote that goes along with the chart that states: "Forecasts of the unemployment rate without the recovery plan vary substantially. Some private forecasters anticipate unemployment rates as high as 11% in the absence of action." The administration has acknowledged its projections were wrong. In a July 2, 2009, interview, Romer said on Fox: "None of us had a crystal ball back in December and January. I think almost every private forecaster realized that there were other things going on in the economy. It was worse than we anticipated." Indeed, in January 2009, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected the unemployment rate would climb to 8.3 percent in 2009 and peak at 9 percent in 2010. By February, the prediction was even higher — 9 percent in 2009 without the stimulus, and 7.7 to 8.5 percent with a stimulus. So, is the fact that unemployment rose even as the stimulus unfolded proof that it has failed? White House officials have steadfastly maintained that the stimulus is working, that even though the unemployment rate has risen above where it was projected in January 2009, it would be even worse if not for the stimulus. That was the gist of Obama's claim in a town hall meeting on the economy in Racine, Wis., on June 30, 2010. "Now, every economist who has looked at it has said that the recovery did its job," Obama said. "It put a brake on the collapse of the economy. We avoided a Great Depression. We are now growing again. The problem is, No. 1, it’s hard to argue sometimes, things would have been a lot worse. Right? So people kind of say, yeah, but unemployment is still at 9.6. Yes, but it’s not 12 or 13, or 15." That comment was ridiculed by the Daily Show's Jon Stewart who commented, "I believe we can all agree as Americans there are many numbers bigger than nine." Obama is correct that many independent economists agree that the stimulus has created more than a million jobs and kept the unemployment rate from going even higher than it has (though in fairness, not every economist agrees with that). But there is an inherent uncertainty in economic forecasting. And how can you ever prove that if the unemployment rate got to X percent, it would or would not have gotten a point or two higher if not for the stimulus? The same holds true for Republicans who say the rising unemployment rates prove the stimulus isn't working. Again, it's difficult to empirically prove whether they're right or wrong. Will didn't use the word "promise" as Cantor did when we checked the same claim a year ago, but the meaning is the same, that Obama was offering some sort of guarantee the stimulus would keep the unemployment rate below 8 percent. The administration never characterized it that way and included plenty of disclaimers saying the predictions had "significant margins of error" and a higher degree of uncertainty due to a recession that is "unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity." In short, it was an economic projection with warnings of a high margin for error, not a take-it-to-the-bank pledge of an upper limit on unemployment. So we find Will's claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-08732	"The Great Lakes Compact has a loophole. And the loophole is that while you cannot remove the water in a big transport, you can remove it in containers of 5.7 gallons or less."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2010/sep/01/dennis-kucinich/dennis-kucinich-warns-loophole-great-lakes-compact/	Think of the Great Lakes compact as a fence. The agreement is meant to wrap around the Great Lakes watershed and keep people from taking water out. But U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich isn’t so sure. He fears the states could be powerless to stop Great Lakes water from being exported from the watershed in small bottles. The lakes, 84 percent of North America’s surface water supply, are one of the world’s greatest natural resources that must be protected, he says. "The Great Lakes Compact has a loophole. And the loophole is that while you cannot remove the water in a big transport, you can remove it in containers of 5.7 gallons or less," he says in a video posted to You Tube. Kucinich, along with Democratic Reps. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio, Bart Stupak of Michigan and Betty McCollum of Minnesota, introduced legislation he says will address the issue. Could the Great Lakes compact have such a big hole in it that it doesn’t hold water? We thought we’d take a look. For starters, a little about the agreement formally known as the Great Lakes – St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact. The eight states and two Canadian provinces in the watershed negotiated the agreement. President George W. Bush signed it into law after approval by the Congress in 2008. It is intended to prevent diversion of water from the Great Lakes themselves and the rest of the watershed. Negotiations got serious after a proposal in the ’90s to send water from Lake Superior to Asia as a humanitarian effort. A group obtained a permit from the Ontario Ministry of the Environment to export about 160 million gallons a year, one transport ship at a time. The uproar and objections were so great that the permit later was revoked. The compact bars most diversion of water from the Great Lakes basin. One exception, the language to which Kucinich refers, is a provision that opens the door to removal of water in containers of 5.7 gallons (about 20 liters) or less. The figure originated with the province of Ontario, which decided it wasn't going to worry about "the small stuff," withdrawals smaller than 20 liters, Annin said. The exception was created for the bottled water industry and was one of the most emotional issues during the compact’s negotiation, said Peter Annin, an expert on Great Lakes water and author of the award-winning book "The Great Lakes Water Wars." The book has been called the definitive book on the water diversion controversy. Some states were unconcerned, but others like Michigan and Wisconsin, which both have water bottling industries, viewed it was a serious issue, he said. Some negotiators doubted an agreement could be reached if included a bottled-water ban. The compact gives each state and province the ability to restrict removal of water in small containers within their jurisdictions. The language in the compact is just a starting point, Annin said. But Kucinich fears that the compact redefines water as a commodity and that agreements like the North American Free Trade Agreement could be used to prevent states from exercising that authority. "So, if someone wants to set up a bottling business, theoretically, either on the lake or on the shore, there’s nothing that stops the water from being defined as a product if it’s 5.7 gallons or less, and therefore, put it within the realm of us not being able to stop someone from removing the water for their own private profit," he says in the video. That is a minority view, Annin says. "The vast majority of the environmental advocates, attorneys and politicians in the Great Lakes basin do not believe that there is a bottle loophole in the compact," he said. "We don’t know if the majority is right or the minority is right. What we do know is that armies of lawyers have signed off on it." An answer may not be known until someone litigates and there is a court ruling, he said. Meanwhile, Annin said, the impact on the broader Great Lakes ecosystem that bottling companies might have from tapping the lakes for water is not a raging issue among environmentalists. Annin said most hydrologists he has talked to are more concerned with the impact that bottled water can have on a localized watershed, rather than the region as a whole. And there already are some sizable diversions that predate the compact. The largest is in Chicago, where nearly 2.1 billion gallons a day are removed from the Great Lakes basin for water to Chicago suburbs that are outside the Great Lakes basin and to connect the Chicago River to the Mississippi via the Ship and Sanitary Canal. It opened in 1900. That’s enough water to fill 13.4 billion 20-ounce bottles each day, every day. Food & Water Watch, a non-profit organization based in Washington that promotes healthy food and affordable drinking water, estimates that the total amount of tap water and spring water bottled in PET plastic for sale in retail stores across the United States in 2009 amounted to about 5.2 billion gallons. That's for the entire year. Kucinich is correct that the Great Lakes compact allows water to be removed in small containers. But experts appear skeptical that that "loophole" will have a serious impact. We rate Kucinich’s statement Mostly True. Comment on this item.

pomt-09757	During the Reagan era, "the richest Americans had their top income tax rate cut in half."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/06/michael-moore/michael-moore-claims-during-reagan-years-richest-h/	In his latest film, Capitalism: A Love Story , Michael Moore takes more than a few swipes at President Ronald Reagan, essentially asserting that under Reagan's watch, the rich got richer at the expense of everyone else. During the Reagan era, he said, "the richest Americans had their top income tax rate cut in half." Moore is correct that the top marginal tax rate — the rate of income tax charged to an individual on their last dollar of earnings — decreased from 70 percent in 1980 to 28 percent in 1989. That's not the same as saying the richest had their taxes cut in half. In 1980, the top marginal tax rate was 70 percent on earnings over $161,300. The rate was substantially lower for the income earned below that. For example, that year, there were no taxes on the first $2,300 of income; 14 percent on income between $2,300 and $4,400; and on up via a graduated scale. So if you made $162,000 in 1980, for example, you paid far less on average than 70 percent of your income in federal taxes. The marginal tax rate also doesn't take into account various available deductions and tax credits, said Bob Williams of the Tax Policy Center. When Reagan revamped the tax code and dropped the top marginal tax rates to 50 percent in 1982, and then down to 28 percent by 1988, he also closed some of the tax loopholes available to people at the top. It's much fairer, we think, to look at effective individual income tax rates. That's the actual percentage of income that people paid in income taxes, factoring in not only the graduated percentages along the marginal tax rate scale, but also the deductions and tax credits that people were entitled to. In 1980, the effective individual income tax rate for the top 1 percent of earners was 22.3 percent. In 1989, that rate dropped to 19.9 percent. That's a decrease of 2.4 percentage points, which works out to an 11 percent drop. That's sizable, but nowhere near 50 percent. If you widen the field and consider the top 10 percent of earners, instead of just the top 1 percent, the drop in effective individual income tax rate was about the same, just over 10 percent. For middle incomes, the effective individual income tax rate also dropped, from 8 percent to 6 percent. That's a 25 percent decrease. In other words, it wasn't just the rich who saw their income tax rates drop under Reagan. One more thing. When the top marginal tax rate dropped between 1980 and 1989, it went from 70 percent on earnings over $161,300 in 1980 to 28 percent on earnings over $128,810 in 1989. Obviously, that's not an apples-to-apples comparison. Did the rich get richer during the Reagan years? Yes. And Moore is technically correct when he says that "the richest Americans had their top income tax rate cut in half." But we suspect some may mistake that for the richest having their taxes cut in half. In fact, we first began to look at this claim from a fact sheet provided on Moore's Web site before the movie was publicly released. And in the fact sheet, it states that "the richest had their taxes cut in half." We were prepared to give that a False, as the effective tax rate for the richest was cut by about 10 or 11 percent. But in the movie, Moore describes it as "the top income tax rate," apparently referring to the highest marginal rate. As we said, some may misinterpret that, but we think Moore has been careful enough with his words to get a Mostly True.

pomt-10176	"Senator Obama has the most liberal voting record in the United States Senate."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/26/john-mccain/several-ratings-rank-obama-lower/	In the first debate of the 2008 general election, John McCain accused Barack Obama of being too liberal. "Senator Obama has the most liberal voting record in the United States Senate," McCain said. "It's hard to reach across the aisle from that far to the left." Republican candidates often brand their Democratic opponents as liberals to portray them as lefties who favor big government and high taxes. Linguists who study political rhetoric say Republicans have been so effective at giving the word a negative connotation that many Democrats won't call themselves liberals. They prefer "progressives." Still, many political scientists and journalists use the term to represent the Democratic extreme of the political spectrum, and National Journal, a nonpartisan political magazine, uses a liberal-conservative scale for its annual rating of congressional votes. The magazine's editors and reporters choose key votes on major issues and those that they believe exhibit a split between liberals and conservatives and then calculate how often senators and House members vote each way. They calculate the liberal/conservative votes in three areas — economic, social issues and foreign policy — and then average them for a composite score. The annual rankings generate some publicity for the magazine, especially in election years. In 2004, the magazine said the most liberal senator was Sen. John Kerry, who became the Democratic nominee for president. On Jan. 31, 2008, five days before the Super Tuesday primaries, National Journal published an article headlined "Obama: Most Liberal Senator in 2007." The article said Obama had missed 33 of the 99 votes that were rated but that it was enough for a calculation. The magazine said McCain was not rated because he missed more than half the votes in the economic and foreign-policy categories. Since Obama's rating was announced, McCain and other Republicans have frequently cited it to criticize Obama. Yet other ratings don't show Obama as the Senate's top lefty. He wasn't the top liberal in his two other years in the U.S. Senate according to National Journal . He was 10th-most liberal in 2006 and 16th in 2005. The McCain campaign has previously cited a 2006 rating by the liberal group Americans for Democratic Action that gave Obama 95 percent, which the campaign noted was the same as Kerry and Sen. Barbara Boxer. But there's a little sleight of hand in that one. Although the McCain campaign is correct that Obama earned a 95 percent rating that year for voting the way ADA wanted, there were 10 senators who got more liberal scores than Obama, including Barbara Mikulski of Maryland and Richard Durbin of Illinois. (In the latest ADA rating, for 2007, Obama missed five of the 20 votes the group scored, so he received a 75 percent rating. But he voted the way ADA wanted on each of the 15 votes he attended.) Voteview.com, a site created by political scientists that plots lawmakers on a liberal-conservative scale based on their voting patterns, calculated there were nine senators more liberal than Obama in the current Congress, including Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, Chris Dodd of Connecticut and Bernie Sanders of Vermont. "Obama is a liberal, but he’s not the most liberal," said Keith Poole, a University of California-San Diego professor who runs the site, whom we interviewed when we first looked into similar statements in June 2008. Ratings from Congressional Quarterly don't measure liberal/conservative votes, but they show Obama is not quite as partisan as other senators. In CQ’s calculation of party unity, which measures how often members vote with their party on bills where Republicans and Democrats split, Obama got a 97 percent rating last year. Ten Democrats had higher scores. On votes where President Bush indicated his position, CQ found Obama supported the Republican president 40 percent of the time in 2007, which put Obama in the middle of the pack for Democrats. He supported Bush 49 percent the previous year. If McCain had made a more general statement about Obama's ideology, he could have been more accurate. But McCain's statement that Obama "has the most liberal voting record in the United States Senate," suggests it is a cumulative rating for all of Obama's time in the Senate. But in fact, it is true for only one rating for one year. Measurements for other years and by other groups show Obama is not the No. 1 liberal — in some cases, far from No. 1. So we find McCain's statement to be Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-14147	"Frankly, (Hillary Clinton) doesn’t do very well with women."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/02/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-hillary-clinton-doesnt-do-very-/	During a May 2 interview on CNN’s New Day, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump doubled down on his charge that his potential Democratic rival in November, Hillary Clinton, is playing the "woman card." "She's playing the woman card," Trump told host Chris Cuomo. "And if she didn't play the woman card, she would have no chance whatsoever of winning." Trump went on to say that Clinton’s standing among female voters in particular is nothing to write home about. "Frankly, (Hillary Clinton) doesn’t do very well with women," Trump said. "If you look at what happened recently, … in the last two weeks, including New York. I won with women by vast, vast majorities. I was way, way up with women far above anybody else in the exit polls of the recent election." Clinton may have gleefully embraced Trump’s "woman card" attack line, but we thought it’s still worth checking whether Trump is right that Clinton "doesn’t do very well with women." Trump, as it turns out, couldn’t be more wrong. The recent primaries Let’s give Trump his due: He has a right to be braggadocious about his own record with women voters in recent GOP primaries. Trump unquestionably routed his opponents among female voters during the four recent primaries for which exit polls exist. He won 57 percent of women in the New York primary, 55 percent of women in the Connecticut primary, 50 percent of women in the Maryland primary, and 54 percent of women in the Pennsylvania primary. That said, even among women voting in these GOP primaries, Trump experiences a gender gap: According to these exit polls, women -- by a modest but consistent margin -- supported Trump by smaller margins than men did. In New York, he was six points stronger among men. In Connecticut that gap was five points, in Maryland it was nine points, and in Pennsylvania it was seven points. And there’s an even more important problem for Trump’s claim: His own success among Republican women doesn’t have anything to say about how well or poorly Clinton is doing with women. Polling a Clinton vs. Trump matchup We found seven April polls at realclearpolitics.com that asked respondents about how they would vote if Clinton faced off against Trump in November. Here’s a rundown: Poll Clinton share of female vote Trump share of female vote Lead among women IBD/TIPP 51 36 Clinton +15 Rasmussen 41 35 Clinton +6 USA Today/Suffolk 55 34 Clinton +21 GWU/Battleground 54 35 Clinton +19 NBC News/WSJ 56 33 Clinton +23 Fox News 55 33 Clinton +22 CBS News 58 31 Clinton +27 Average 53 34 Clinton +19 Clearly, this doesn’t support Trump’s assertion that Clinton "doesn’t do very well with women." We are still a long way from Election Day, of course, but if this pattern holds, it would represent a gender gap of historic proportions. Here’s how women have split their vote in presidential elections going back to 1980, as collected by Rutgers University's Center for the American Woman and Politics: Year Democratic candidate’s share of female vote Republican candidate’s share of female vote Independent candidate’s share of female vote Major party faring better among women 2012 Obama 55 Romney 44 Dem +11 2008 Obama 56 McCain 43 Dem +13 2004 Kerry 51 Bush 48 Dem +3 2000 Gore 54 Bush 43 Nader 2 Dem +11 1996 Clinton 54 Dole 38 Perot 7 Dem +16 1992 Clinton 45 Bush 37 Perot 17 Dem +8 1988 Dukakis 49 Bush 50 GOP +1 1984 Mondale 44 Reagan 56 GOP +12 1980 Carter 45 Reagan 46 Anderson 7 GOP +1 So, Clinton’s 19-point average lead over Trump among women -- if it held all the way to November -- would give her the biggest winning margin among women of any presidential candidate since at least 1980. Finally, it’s worth noting that Clinton is not universally beloved by women -- but her ratings are a whole lot better than Trump’s. In April’s GWU/Battleground poll, for instance, Clinton scored a 51 percent favorable rating among women, with 47 percent unfavorable. By contrast, Trump’s rating among women in the same poll was 26 percent favorable, 71 percent unfavorable. The flip side is that Clinton does under-perform among men; the GWU/Battleground poll found that views of Clinton among men are 33 percent favorable, 66 percent unfavorable. Karlyn Bowman, a poll analyst for the American Enterprise Institute, considers this "a big problem for her." But the silver lining, she added, is that "if past elections are a guide, more women will vote than men – probably about 53 to 54 percent." Our ruling Trump said, "Frankly, (Hillary Clinton) doesn’t do very well with women." The evidence he used to support this claim during the CNN interview -- his large margins among women in recent GOP primaries -- is undeniable, but says nothing about how well Clinton does among women. In fact, looking at a cross-section of April polls, Clinton’s average lead over Trump among female voters is bigger than any nominee has registered in an actual presidential election election in at least 36 years.

pomt-12128	Chicago city officials "have adopted an official policy of protecting criminal aliens who prey on their own residents."	false	/illinois/statements/2017/aug/16/jeff-sessions/jeff-sessions-stretches-link-criminal-aliens-and-c/	When Chicago filed a lawsuit Aug. 7 to block the U.S. Justice Department from withholding federal police grant money from so-called sanctuary cities, U.S. Attorney Jeff Sessions reacted swiftly and fiercely. "To a degree perhaps unsurpassed by any other jurisdiction, the political leadership of Chicago has chosen deliberately and intentionally to adopt a policy that obstructs this country’s lawful immigration system," Sessions said in a press release. "They have demonstrated an open hostility to enforcing laws designed to protect law enforcement — Federal, state, and local — and reduce crime, and instead have adopted an official policy of protecting criminal aliens who prey on their own residents." Under its Welcoming City Ordinance, which defines Chicago’s "sanctuary city" status, the Chicago Police Department "will not question crime victims, witnesses and other law-abiding residents about their legal status." It also will not use immigration status alone as grounds for detention, and it imposes strict limits on interaction between police officers and federal immigration agents. Like other cities with similar policies, Chicago says doing so fosters trust between immigrant communities and the police department, so immigrants won’t fear coming to police to report crime or assist police investigations. Accusing the Chicago Police Department of maintaining "an official policy of protecting criminal aliens who prey on their own residents" is a pretty serious charge from the nation’s top law enforcement officer. We thought this deserved a closer look. Punching bag city Chicago was one of Donald Trump’s favorite punching bags during the 2016 presidential campaign, when he repeatedly invoked the city’s murder and gun-crime rate as a byproduct of everything from its gun laws to its leadership. After he was elected, he threatened to "send in the feds" to tamp down the city’s crime. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Sessions’ invocation of "criminal aliens who prey on their own residents" refers to a theme that has been prevalent in Trump’s platform ever since the day he announced his candidacy with a speech highly disparaging of Mexican immigrants who enter the U.S. illegally. The central premise is that undocumented immigrants present an unusually high propensity for crime. On Aug. 16, Sessions doubled down on the alleged link between Chicago’s violent crime and its sanctuary city status in a speech in Miami, which dropped its sanctuary status to comply with the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration. "Respect for the rule of law has broken down. In Chicago, their so-called ‘sanctuary’ policies are just one sad example," Sessions said. "...We have already seen that: the same Independence Day weekend when Chicago suffered more than 100 shootings and 15 homicides, Miami-Dade also had an historic number of shooting deaths – zero." The alleged link between illegal immigrants and surges in crime is an idea that has been debunked repeatedly for decades in numerous academic, government and advocacy-group studies. So we started our look at Sessions’ statement by contacting the Department of Justice with a request for data to back up his claim. The response we got back was obtuse and weird. It came from a justice department press aide and was so loaded with swampy beltway caveats--"deep background," "background," "not for attribution," and "off the record" -- that we consulted our dog-eared copy of "All The President’s Men" for guidance. But to no avail. To be clear, we never agreed to any preconditions in seeking official comment and feel under no obligation to abide by them. And we won’t. So what follows, in full, is the official DOJ response to our question. (Click here to view in pdf format.) See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Where to start? Perhaps with the link to the Washington Post story, which argues vigorously against the position taken by Sessions even while acknowledging that there’s no way to be 100 percent sure there’s no link between illegal immigration and Chicago’s homicide rate. At the same time, the article does state flatly, "There’s no link between a jurisdiction being a sanctuary city and higher crime rates." It also cites a pair of statistics that would argue strongly against the DOJ’s position. While 84 percent of Chicago’s undocumented immigrants come from Latin America, 82 percent of its murder victims at the time of the article were black vs. only 4 percent Hispanic, the Post reports. "FBI data show that most killings in the United States are carried out by people in the same racial group as the victim. The reason for this is obvious: Homicides are usually a function of personal relationships, and people generally associate with family members and friends who share their racial identity," the article states. It’s not conclusive evidence that immigrants aren’t driving up Chicago’s homicide rate, it continues, but "this isn’t what we’d expect the demographics to look like if Chicago’s homicides were tightly intertwined with a population of immigrants who are in the country illegally from Latin America." DOJ also referred us to a 2016 study by the Murder Accountability Project, a non-profit group that tracks unsolved homicides and advocates for better crime reporting, that showed Illinois had the lowest homicide clearance rate in the nation. But the report attributes the state’s poor showing to record-keeping methods used by the Illinois State Police in gathering crime data statewide. Still, the DOJ spokesman argues that combining those articles with Chicago’s status as a sanctuary city -- in which police do not collect immigration information -- validates Sessions. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, however, has a simpler explanation. "The vast majority of our issues in Chicago and our violent crime is committed by homegrown people - either individuals that were born and raised in Chicago or most certainly in this country," Johnson said in an NPR interview Aug. 7. "So our instances of undocumented people committing horrific crimes and murder in particular in Chicago is just - it's nominal." Against those two articles stands a mountain of research that casts doubt on Sessions’ assertion that illegal immigrants cause crime to rise and that Chicago’s official police policy on immigrants endangers residents. "Immigrants are in fact much less likely to commit crime than natives, and the presence of large numbers of immigrants seems to lower crime rates," said a 2015 report by the National Academy of Sciences. One of the authors of that report explained why to PolitiFact in 2016: Immigrants come to the United States to build better lives for themselves and their children, said Walter A. Ewing, a senior researcher at the American Immigration Council and one of the report’s authors. "They are very motivated to not blow that opportunity by getting in trouble with the police," he said in an email interview. "This is especially so for unauthorized immigrants, who can be deported at any time for unlawful presence." Crime went down even as the immigrant population increased, the report said. The NAS study reinforced the findings of a 2005 paper by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. "Despite the widespread perception of a link between immigration and crime, immigrants have much lower institutionalization (incarceration) rates than the native born. More recently arrived immigrants have the lowest comparative incarceration rates, and this difference increased from 1980 to 2000," that report said. These studies blow a big hole in Sessions’ underlying assertion of "criminal aliens" being significantly responsible for the increase in gun violence in Chicago. Sanctuary safety But what about Sessions’ allegation that Chicago’s "official policy" protects "criminal aliens?" CPD’s directive "Responding to Incidents Involving Citizenship Status" lays out the do’s and don’ts for officers dealing with undocumented immigrants. Essentially, it prohibits officers from detaining anyone based on questions about citizenship status and sharply limits interaction with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency. However, it also establishes exceptions for suspects with outstanding criminal warrants, who are known gang members or convicted felons or are on trial for a felony. The city defended its policy in its lawsuit against the federal government: "(T)his policy promotes public safety by ensuring that no city resident or visitor, regardless of immigration status, is afraid to cooperate with law enforcement, report criminal activity to the police, testify as a witness in court, or seek help as a victim of crime; and by ensuring that police officers focus on criminal activity occurring in Chicago instead of federal civil immigration infractions." A 2017 report by the National Immigration Law Center that focused specifically on counties that employed "sanctuary city" policies bolsters Chicago’s case. "Crime is statistically significantly lower in sanctuary counties compared to nonsanctuary (sic) counties," the report said. "The data support arguments made by law enforcement executives that communities are safer when law enforcement agencies do not become entangled in federal immigration enforcement efforts." The problem for Chicago here is that, because its police department does not collect immigration data, the city can’t unequivocally state that its murder or gun violence rates are not attributable to immigrants. The anecdotal evidence in Chicago’s favor appears strong, but it’s still anecdotal. Our ruling U.S. Attorney Jeff Sessions said Chicago’s leaders "have adopted an official policy of protecting criminal aliens who prey on their own residents." Chicago’s Welcoming City Ordinance does prohibit Chicago police officers from using citizenship information as the sole grounds for detaining people and sharply limits the interaction between city police and federal immigration agents. But evidence overwhelmingly suggests this is much less a matter of "protecting criminal aliens" than of fostering trust between local law enforcement and immigrant communities. Yet because Chicago does not collect immigration data in police interactions, it can’t be known conclusively how many of its murders and gun crimes are committed by illegal immigrants "who prey on their own residents." That absence of conclusive data to disprove Sessions doesn’t give him license to make claims that are groundless. Chicago’s sanctuary city policy does not protect undocumented people who commit crimes, despite what Sessions claims. Only the microscopic sliver of ambiguity about conclusive data prevents us from labeling his statement "Pants on Fire," our lowest possible credibility rating. Instead, we rate it False.

pomt-01258	Georgia has led the nation in student fatalities caused by motorists illegally passing stopped school buses.	true	/georgia/statements/2014/nov/11/sloan-roach/gwinnett-spokeswoman-target-claim-about-school-bus/	About two dozen Georgia school systems have added cameras to their school buses since 2011. The cameras have one purpose: catching motorists who break a state law that requires them to stop for school buses that are picking up and dropping off students. Gwinnett County, the state’s largest school district, will be issuing warnings soon — and tickets after the Christmas break — to violators caught by its cameras. "Prior to the law being passed that allowed for the use of cameras to enforce the law that addresses those who illegally pass a school bus, Georgia led the nation in student fatalities resulting from motorists illegally passing stopped school buses," Sloan Roach, the executive director of communications and media relations for Gwinnett County Public Schools, told reporters Nov. 6. That’s a grim statistic. PolitiFact Georgia decided to take a closer look. Georgia law allows police officers who witness motorists passing a stopped bus to issue a $1,000 moving violation misdemeanor. But after 5-year-old Karla Campos was killed when a driver sped past her stopped school bus in Cobb County in 2009, parents lobbied lawmakers to allow video cameras to catch violators. Their case was bolstered by a report that Campos was one of five Georgia children to die that year in bus-related accidents. That accounted for 38 percent of the 13 child fatalities occurring in 50 states and the District of Columbia, according to the 2009-2010 National School Bus Loading & Unloading Survey by the Kansas State Department of Education. They included a 7-year-old struck and killed crossing the street with another child to catch his bus. The elderly driver said he couldn’t see the boys because of fog. The 7-year-old’s companion survived. Georgia changed state law in 2011 to allow the installation of video cameras on school buses to catch violators. By the following school year, Cobb and Fayette County schools had already begun arming some of their district buses with cameras. At the time, Cobb estimated that about 1,000 violations occurred per day, or nearly one violation for each bus the district has on the road. By the end of the school year, the Cobb program caught 871 violators using cameras on 102 of the district’s buses. But because the law still required police to issue citations, those motorists only received warnings. State lawmakers have since updated the 2011 law to allow the districts or outside vendors to issue violations. Fines are $300 for the first offense and up to $1,000 for the third offense in five years. There is evidence that the increased enforcement has cut violations. In April 2013, Cobb filed 1,300 citations. This April, there were 767 citations in the state’s second-largest school district. A statewide poll of bus drivers, who reported the number of motorists who blew past a stopped bus, also saw a decline from 8,102 in the 2010-2011 school year to 7,619 last year, according to an annual survey conducted by the National Association of State Directors of Pupil Transportation Services. Carlton Allen, Georgia’s representative to that group, said the new law has helped. So, too, did a blitz by the Governor’s Office of Highway Safety two years ago to focus on the problem. But Georgia still had 13 student deaths during bus loadings and unloadings in the past five years, said Allen, who is director of of pupil transportation services at the Georgia Department of Education. "To me, part of that is the loss of a school bus safety unit in the state patrol and a reduction in our staff," Allen said of his office, down to three trainers from seven plus a clerical worker. That leaves it to the local systems to seek other ways to reduce violations, which in Gwinnett numbered 2,000 in a single day. American Traffic Solutions, which has taken over the program in Cobb, now sends video of violators to the county police to confirm a violation before they issue a citation. In the metro area, Decatur, Clayton and Marietta schools also use the video cameras. Atlanta and Fulton have signaled they plan to install the devices in the coming year. Georgia at one time did lead the nation in the number of students killed by motorists passing stopped school buses. That was in the 2009-2010 school year, before the state adopted a law allowing video cameras to help tackle the problem. The state has since updated the law to make it easier to ticket offenders. A growing number of school districts have begun using the video cameras as deterrents. Georgia has not had a year as bad as the record-setter of 2009-2010, with five child deaths. But it also has not been fatality-free as more than 40 states are each year. Even with the cameras, some motorists remain a problem. Roach correctly stated that a study showed Georgia led the nation for bus-related fatalities at the time lawmakers passed a bill allowing the use of the cameras. We rated her statement as True.

pomt-07000	Says the average government worker won't be impacted in the first two years under the reform of state health benefits.	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jul/10/stephen-sweeney/senate-president-stephen-sweeney-claims-average-wo/	After thousands of protesters had descended on Trenton in recent days, New Jersey Assembly members gathered on the evening of June 23 for what would be the final passage of the divisive pension and health benefits reform legislation. That night, Senate President Stephen Sweeney -- one of the principal architects behind the bill -- explained how the health benefit changes would impact the average worker during an "Ask the Senate President" interview on New Jersey 101.5 FM. "Right now, everyone pays 1.5 percent for healthcare," Sweeney, a Democrat who represents the southwestern part of the state, told host Eric Scott. "For the average worker, government worker, for the first two years, on that grid that we created, they're not even impacted. They won't even feel it until the third year where they'll see any kind of an increase." Two years without any increases in health care expenses? Based on the senator’s own numbers, PolitiFact New Jersey learned that Sweeney is right about the first year, but in the second year, the average worker’s costs would rise for every type of coverage -- including a nearly 80 percent jump for a family plan. First, let’s talk about the health benefits reform piece of the legislation. Signed into law by Gov. Chris Christie on June 28, the legislation requires all public employees to contribute toward their health care based on a percentage of one’s premium. The contributions, which vary according to salaries and levels of coverage, will be phased in over four years for existing employees. The new regulations apply to all employees whose contract has expired and take effect after existing contracts expire. They also apply immediately to employees not covered by a union contract. But contributions won’t go below 1.5 percent of one’s salary, the minimum amount currently paid by most public employees. Once the premium-sharing percentages exceed that minimum amount, employees would contribute according to the percentages. Now, let’s turn to that "grid" Sweeney referred to in the radio interview. The grid breaks down the premium percentages according to salaries. Because Sweeney referred to the "average worker," we focused on someone earning $60,000, because federal data puts the average annual pay for a New Jersey state employee in that range. Based on the grid, that average worker would continue paying 1.5 percent of his salary in the first year, but starting in the second year, the percentage of premiums would increase his health care costs in each level of coverage. An average worker with family coverage would continue paying $900 in the first year, and then $1,615 in the second year, according to the senator’s grid. Sweeney spokesman Chris Donnelly, who said the senator was aware of our correspondence, acknowledged in an email that the average worker would be impacted in the second year. "The Senate President's goal with these reforms was to create a phase in system that was as fair as possible to lower and middle income workers. He succeeded in doing that," Donnelly wrote in an email. "While he firmly believes the cost of the new plans will lower premiums, if his comment that night mislead(s) anyone, he apologizes. It certainly was not done maliciously, so he hopes to avoid seeing his pants being on fire." But there’s one more problem with the senator’s calculation: we don’t know what the premiums will be yet. Sweeney used projected premiums in his grid, but the new legislation calls for two new committees to design new plans with an anticipated start date of Jan. 1, 2012. The senator argues the new plans could reduce premium costs. Alan Monheit, a professor of Health Economics at the Newark-based University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, said the average premium may be lower than it would have been under the old system, because the new cost-sharing could drive employees to opt for cheaper plans. Still, premiums depend on a group’s level of health care spending, and the recent reform is mainly focused on shifting costs, Monheit said. Let’s review: Sweeney said in a radio interview that the average worker won’t pay higher health care costs until the third year of the new health benefits reform. But the senator’s own figures prove him wrong, showing increases starting in the second year. Also, the premiums at the heart of this debate have yet to be determined by the new committees.

pomt-14104	University of Texas undergraduate student debt "is less than $21,000… probably one of the lowest debts across the nation."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2016/may/12/bill-mcraven/bill-mcraven-university-texas-says-ut-students-gra/	The University of Texas System’s chancellor suggests that if you’ve been a UT undergraduate--on any campus--you’re likely not buried in school debt. Bill McRaven prefaced his January 2016 declaration: "I’m proud to say, and I checked these numbers for about the hundredth time yesterday, because I always make sure that I don’t get my pants on fire in terms of that Pants on Fire meter." "But across the University of Texas," McRaven told the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, "our undergraduates..., their debt is less than $21,000… That’s probably one of the lowest debts across the nation--and so we’re proud of that." We couldn’t resist checking his figure, finding it has a basis yet there are paths to a range of figures, especially if you bore in on graduates of particular UT institutions. A 12-year median Asked what McRaven was recalling, a UT System spokeswoman told us the median cumulative debt for certain UT graduates was $20,755 (meaning half the graduates had more debt, half had less) in inflation-adjusted 2014 dollars. By email, Jenny LaCoste-Caputo said McRaven’s figure, based on data collected for graduates from UT institutions over the dozen years through 2012-13, reflected borrowing related to tuition and fees, room and board, books and supplies as well as transportation and other expenses. Those figures show some graduates accumulating far less debt, others more. For instance, some 10 percent owe $5,415 or less while at the high end, 10 percent owe $42,051 or more. LaCoste-Caputo, asked why McRaven highlighted the 12-year median, said the chancellor seeks to show that a UT degree pays off. She said that according to a UT System analysis, median annual earnings of graduates 10 years after graduation run about $60,000. Whatever the chancellor's intention, 12 years struck us as a pretty wide time window. So to our request, LaCoste-Caputo provided the median debt for loan-taking graduates of UT schools solely for the latest available year, 2012-13. That median debt load was $23,350, some 13 percent greater than the 12-year median. Transfer students not considered We confirmed another wrinkle: UT's median debt figures don’t reflect every graduate or loan. LaCoste-Caputo said the median calculations consider only graduates who also had been first-time students on a UT campus--not reflecting any debts accumulated by transfer students from non-UT institutions such as community colleges. For the dozen years, she advised, McRaven relied on data for 43,900 bachelor’s degree recipients and didn’t have sufficient data for 82,380 degree recipients who borrowed money while attending other schools besides UT. Put another way, she said, the median figure McRaven touted considers information for about 35 percent of the student-borrowers to get a UT degree in the period. Brace yourself. We're about to share other ways of looking at UT student debt plus some national figures. Another Texas analysis More research made us think a graduate's debt level can be influenced by which UT school she or he embraces. On behalf of the coordinating board, spokeswoman Kelly Carper Polden replied to our email queries by saying loan-taking UT students who graduated in the 12 months through August 2015 had average debt ranging from less than $17,500 to more than $39,000, counting state, federal and reported parent loans. Average Debt, Loan-Taking Graduates, University of Texas Schools, Fiscal 2015 Institution Average Debt UT-Arlington $24,970 UT-Austin $39,305 UT-Brownsville $23,634 UT-Dallas $24,028 UT-El Paso $22,593 UT–Pan American $17,264 The University of Texas of the Permian Basin $20,516 UT-Rio Grande Valley* Not Available* UT-San Antonio $30,406 UT-Tyler $28,474 SOURCE: Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (chart fielded by email from Kelly Carper Polden, assistant director of communications, May 6, 2016) *UT-RGV, bringing together the former UT-Brownsville and UT-Pan American, started operations in September 2015. From beyond Texas, Sandy Baum of the Washington, D.C.-based Urban Institute nudged us to information on a federal website enabling us to peg the median federal-loan student debt for 2013-14 graduates from each of nine UT campuses. By our calculation, the median across the UT schools averaged $18,465. Graduates of UT-Pan American had the lowest median debt, $12,994. Graduates of UT-San Antonio had the biggest, $23,723. Also, Sara Goldrick-Rab at the University of Wisconsin responded to our inquiry by suggesting we consider work by the Oakland-based Institute for College Access & Success, an independent nonprofit that says it works to make higher education more available and affordable for people of all backgrounds. Next, the institute’s Matthew Reed said by email that according to data volunteered by the majority of U.S. colleges to Peterson’s, which publishes a college guide, among 2013-14 graduates from UT schools who took out loans, the average debt level (not adjusted for inflation) ranged, by campus, from $14,900, at UT-Pan American, to $27,337, at UT-San Antonio--with average debt at the Austin flagship being $27,207. An institute spreadsheet also showed average loan totals for graduates of UT-Dallas ($19,613), UT-Arlington ($23,210) and UT-El Paso ($24,000). All told, these figures suggest a 2013-14 average debt level for loan-taking UT graduates of $22,711--about $2,000 more than McRaven’s 12-year inflation-adjusted median figure. But the "transfers" caveat persists: Reed said that like McRaven, the institute was limited to data for students who went to the same institution before graduating; no transfers considered. What gives? Reed said colleges resist efforts to collect data for all students, saying it’s unfair to hold them accountable for students who borrowed while studying elsewhere. Separately, Mark Kantrowitz, a Chicago-based expert, said by phone that Congress even barred the government from tracking individual students and their respective debt loads. "Not perfect data," Reed said, "but they’re the best available." UT versus nation McRaven also said UT students probably carry smaller debt loads than peers nationally. Asked how he reached that judgment, LaCoste-Caputo pointed out the College Board’s Trends in Student Aid 2015 report, which states that in 2012-13, the average cumulative debt for bachelor’s degree recipients from U.S. public, four-year institutions was $25,500. Worth noting: 61 percent of students who earned bachelor’s degrees in 2013-14 from the public or private nonprofit four-year institutions at which they began their studies graduated with debt, the report says. Such borrowers, it says, averaged $26,900 in loans, reflecting an inflation-adjusted increase of 17 percent over a decade. Separately, we spotted an institute web page stating the average debt of 2013-14 graduates of public four-year institutions was $25,902 with the average debt in federal loans equaling $22,901. The average debt for graduates of private nonprofit institutions was $29,567, according to the page. And by our read of the spreadsheet provided by Reed, the average debt for loan-taking graduates of six reporting UT schools exceeded the average debt for graduates from about 200 other institutions nationally. But the UT average trailed the average for graduates of about 910 U.S. colleges and universities. By phone, Kantrowitz said that by his estimate, debt accumulated by 2015 loan-taking U.S. college graduates averaged $35,000, counting federal and private-institution loans. Worse: Kantrowitz said he projects 2016 graduates to average about $37,000 in accumulated debt. We wondered why his figures considerably outpace estimates from others. Kantrowitz said he rolls in data from more institutions, public and private. He also emailed us a spreadsheet indicating that about 70 percent of recent graduates carry some school-loan debt. Our ruling McRaven said that across the UT system, undergraduate student debt "is less than $21,000… probably one of the lowest debts across the nation." The experiences of graduates over a dozen years supports this figure. Data also support the notion that UT graduates wind up less debt-burdened than most peers. Still, UT's analysis (like others) doesn't account for debts piled up by transfer students. Significantly too, UT graduates in 2012-13 had a median debt of $23,350, which outpaces the long-term figure aired by McRaven by more than $2,000. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-08707	Jim Dunnam "has not lived in the district he represents for years now."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2010/sep/06/republican-party-texas/republican-party-texas-says-democratic-house-leade/	When the chairman of the Texas House Democratic Caucus goes home, does he stay in the Waco-area district he represents? That’s turf covered -- actually, re-plowed -- by the Republican Party of Texas in an Aug. 30 e-mail blast saying state Rep. Jim Dunnam "has not lived in the district he represents for years now." The party chairman, Steve Munisteri, had earlier levelled the same charge in a Waco press conference. We wondered what was what, and where. Some background: Article 3 of the Texas Constitution says House members must be Texas residents for two years and, before their election, must have lived for at least a year in the district they would represent. A similar one-year provision applies to Senate candidates, though they must have lived in Texas for five years; that hurdle has been in the news in connection with Republican Brian Birdwell’s eligibility to fill the Texas Senate seat he recently won in a special election. Birdwell has acknowledged voting for president in Virginia in 2004. Dunnam’s legal residency has been challenged before. After the 2002 elections, Dunnam was sued by his defeated GOP foe, who said the legislator, his wife and children had lived since 1998 near McGregor (a Waco suburb) in a house no longer in the district Dunnam represents. Dunnam’s house was cut out of his district when a state board redrew districts in 2001, according an Associated Press report from the time. The story quotes Dunnam saying he’d moved to a smaller house in his redrawn district (which he told us he later sold), but also kept the house near McGregor because he didn't want to uproot his kids from the Midway school district until absolutely necessary. The lawsuit was later dismissed by a judge. This August, the Waco Tribune-Herald quoted Munisteri saying the party now plans no legal challenge to Dunnam’s legal residency. The chairman said "residency cases are extremely difficult to win" because the state’s standard for determining residency is based in part on a candidate’s intended residence. "You can be absent from a location for a significant period of time and still be determined to be in the district legally," Munisteri said. But "there’s a difference between legally being in the district and really in the district." The Tribune-Herald and the Dallas Morning News subsequently quoted Dunnam saying he owns the house outside his district so his children can attend Midway schools--plus a rural home he considers his homestead in nearby Falls County, which is in Dunnam’s district. Dunnam told the Morning News that he votes in Chilton in Falls County where he and his wife built their house on 90 acres. Using Google Maps, we determined the Falls County home is about 20 miles south of Dunnam’s house near McGregor. On a website titled "Done With Dunnam," the GOP presents two from-the-road photos of the Falls County house, both taken July 31, according to a notation. The GOP’s caption: "No activity in and out of house and no cars in the driveway." The Republican Party also presents two photographs taken from the street of Dunnam’s house near McGregor, one taken July 18 and the other July 31. In one photo, two of three cars are clearly visible; one has a "state official" license plate. The photos are captioned: "Plenty of activity in and out of the house and cars bearing state official plates in the driveway." Dunnam, objecting to the criticism, told the Morning News: "My constituents have no issue with me and my roots. I've been there 46 years and was literally born in the district -- and my dad was too, and my kids were." Separately, the Texas Tribune quoted Dunnam saying that since his homestead is in his district, Dunnam was confident he clears the constitution’s residency hurdle. Falls County confirmed that Dunnam claims the house as his homestead. According to the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts, one can do so if the home is their "principal residence" on Jan. 1 of the tax year. We also checked the Midway district’s residency requirement. Its website says that admission is free to students if they "and either parent reside in the district." Generally, district spokeswoman Traci Marlin told us, students must live within the school district with a parent who has legal custody or a legal guardian. Marlin said for the purposes of enrolling a student, the district doesn’t weigh whether their families take their homestead exemption on a house outside the district. So, where does Dunnam actually live? When we initially put that question to the legislator, Dunnam said, "I’ll be in Houston tonight, I spent three nights in Austin last week ... I have a residence (the country place) and I spend time at various locations." Hmmm. Is it reasonable to conclude that Dunnam lives apart from his wife and children in his homestead residence in Falls County? Or -- since the Midway district requires at least one parent or guardian of a child to live in the district and Dunnam and his wife appear to be an intact couple -- does it make more sense to conclude the family stays mostly at the house near McGregor? In a follow-up interview, Dunnam said he lives in the Falls County house, which he’d earlier said the couple completed about five years ago. "I live in Chilton," Dunnam said. But "I do spend time at my other house." Dunnam said too that both he and his wife are registered to vote in Falls County and have driver’s licenses with the Falls County address. And, he said, the Midway district has the Falls County address as his home address. We asked if he’d provide us access to that record--which would confirm he’s told the district he doesn’t live at the home near McGregor. Dunnam said he’d do so if we could assure him that would "be dispositive" -- ending our inquiry. We couldn’t guarantee that. He added: "It is unreasonable for you to assume anything about my personal life because you don’t know." True, and neither does the Republican Party. The party’s statement hinges on what is meant by where someone "lives." By a strict interpretation -- the one used by the GOP -- that would be where Dunnam stays most often. But determining that would take significant detective work, far more than a few photos. A broader interpretation would allow for the possibility Dunnam hasn’t lived exclusively in his House district for years, but instead flits between -- and lives in -- both houses. Our take: The party’s statement has an element of truth, but more than that isn’t proven; we rate the statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Republican Party of Texas	None	None	None	2010-09-06T06:00:00	2010-08-30	['None']
pomt-04298	Says Matt Wand has sided with anti-choice activists "to restrict access to reproductive health care services."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2012/nov/01/democratic-party-oregon/did-matt-wand-side-activists-limit-acc/	The Democratic Party of Oregon has sent a mailer in a heated east Multnomah County legislative race, criticizing incumbent Rep. Matt Wand, R-Troutdale, as a know-it-all who doesn’t trust women to make their own medical decisions. "Wand wants to take away a woman’s right to make her own personal medical decisions," the mailer reads. "Matt Wand thinks he knows better than women or their doctors. Matt Wand has sided with extreme anti-choice activists to restrict access to reproductive health care services." The mailer urges a vote for the Democrat in the race, Chris Gorsek, who is endorsed by Planned Parenthood PAC of Oregon. We wanted to know whether Wand, who is endorsed by Oregon Right to Life, sided with activists "to restrict access to reproductive health care services." The mailer doesn't mention the word abortion at all -- not once -- but the evidence cited for the claim is Senate Bill 901 from 2011. The legislation would have re-defined Planned Parenthood and other clinics that provide abortions as "ambulatory surgical centers," subject to the same regulations as centers that do plastic surgery, spine surgery, vision laser surgery, and so on. The legislation would have applied to places that advertise as offering abortions, 10 or more in a month, 100 or more in a year. Wand, a freshman, signed on to the bill, along with 11 state senators, all Republicans. The legislation was introduced in February and assigned to a committee in March, where it died. There was no hearing. House Republicans, who suggested the fact check, and Oregon Right to Life, the anti-abortion group behind the legislation, say the bill was aimed at making abortions safer, not at restricting them. "Terming SB901 as a ‘restriction to reproductive health service’ is pretty much over the top," said executive director Gayle Atteberry in an email to PolitiFact Oregon. Oregon Right to Life opposes abortion except in cases where the mother’s life is in immediate danger. Planned Parenthood advocates, on the other hand, say that Atteberry’s characterization is highly misleading. Abortions are already safe, they say, and the bill is part of a national agenda to burden abortion clinics with structural regulations -- for example, corridor and door width -- that have nothing to do with patient safety. Jimmy Radosta, a spokesman for Planned Parenthood Advocates of Oregon, said the legislation would have required major renovation of its clinics. "The only way to comply would be to tear down and start all over again," he said. Clearly, the bill was aimed at clinics that offer abortion services, which are likely the first stops for women who lack insurance or a regular ob-gyn. Planned Parenthood also has contracts with insurers and provides abortions for physicians who contract with those insurance carriers. But it’s important to note that the legislation would not have applied to all abortion providers. Physicians could continue to offer both medical and surgical abortions at private medical offices, or at hospitals such as Oregon Health & Science University’s women’s health clinic. The legislation also would not have applied to the Lovejoy Surgicenter because the Northwest Portland facility is already an "ambulatory surgical center." Lovejoy is a significant provider and claims on its website that in calendar year 2008 the center performed 55 percent of the 7,100 abortions in the tri-county area. We figured we should hear from Wand on why he supported the bill. He said he couldn’t recall who had brought the legislation to him, although it was probably one of the state senators. Wand said it made sense to consider regulating abortion clinics the same way as places that do "face lifts and tummy tucks." He said Democrats’ "lying about my respect for women is pretty egregious." Trent Lutz, executive director of the Democratic Party of Oregon, noted in an e-mail that Wand has accepted campaign money and other assistance from Oregon Right to Life. "SB 901 would have effectively shut down every provider in the state. We continue to believe that Matt Wand is out of touch and wrong on women's health," he said. Whether Wand is out of touch is an opinion to which he and Democrats are entitled. We do, however, take issue with the assertion about the bill’s impact. Anyone reading the mailer cold might assume that Wand is an extreme anti-abortionist who wants to take away a woman’s right to make her own medical decisions. Given the "reproductive health care services" language, maybe he’s even against contraception. But the bill wasn’t nearly as drastic as that. The legislation focused on abortion, targeting clinics that provide them. But with abortions performed in a variety of places -- at private medical offices, at the women’s health center at Oregon Health & Science University, at Lovejoy Surgicenter -- the legislation would not have shut down every provider as Lutz claims. Wand co-sponsored legislation that in all likelihood would have translated into fewer places for women to go; his stated motivation was safety, not necessarily a desire to restrict access. We realize that for some advocates, this issue isall or nothing; either you’re with us or against us, on both sides. We take a middle road. The statement is partially accurate -- Wand did side with Oregon Right to Life on legislation that would have affected providers -- but it leaves out important details. The legislation did not target all providers and, in fact, would not have affected a significant provider in the metro area. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-01909	U.S. Senate candidate Jack Kingston "requested more earmarks than any other GA Congressman and all GA GOP members combined."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2014/jul/01/david-perdue/does-kingston-bring-home-bacon/	Earmarks are the money lawmakers yank from the federal budget to benefit their jurisdictions. Critics of the system tend to use the pejorative term "pork" for the same taxpayer-funded projects. A pivot to that first definition helped U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi beat a tough tea party-backed challenger in the GOP runoff last week. Cochran focused on the money he brought to the Magnolia State. A recent attack in Georgia’s tight Republican runoff for the U.S. Senate focused more on the second understanding of the term, with a tweet for all the Internet to see. "Jack Kingston requested more earmarks than any other GA Congressman and all GA GOP members combined." David Perdue wrote over pictures of pigs feeding at the trough, lest anyone miss his contempt. That’s a pretty specific claim. And if there’s anything PolitiFact Georgia loves to check, it’s the specifics, especially with the July 22 runoff between Perdue and Kingston looming. Perdue said he based his claim on databases created by the Center for Responsive Politics of OpenSecrets.org. Perdue, a former Dollar General CEO, is running as an outsider who sees earmarks as a type of overspending from longtime Washington representatives such as Kingston. "Before my congressman brings money back to Georgia, I want to know what debt I am going to be responsible for," Perdue said. "The earmark provision drives up the debt and is a free pass on the budget responsibility we want from our congressmen and senators." That kind of criticism prompted Congress to abstain from pork in 2010. Kingston told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 2008 that he had cut back on his requests for earmarks over those complaints. But he also noted his concern that other states would get more money if he and other Georgia lawmakers quit the practice. Open Secrets allows searches to see how much money members of Congress steered to their district for fiscal years 2008 through 2010. Fiscal years run from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30. Our review of those databases shows Kingston made 145 requests in those three years, pulling in about $211 million. His next closest colleague had 213 earmarks, totaling about $202 million. But that’s from U.S. Rep. Sanford Bishop, a Democrat from Albany. Next on the list from the GOP was U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey of Marietta, who lost to Perdue and Kingston in the May primary. He had 58 earmarks that totaled about $94 million. Together, Georgia’s GOP delegation had about $327 million in earmarks for the three years. Kingston’s total was larger than the other six Republican lawmakers combined. Rep Party/District 2010 2009 2008 Total Jack Kingston R-1 $66,787,000 $44,295,625 $100,273,800 $211,356,425 Sanford Bishop D-2 $60,565,000 $66,440,894 $75,141,000 $202,146,894 Lynn Westmoreland R-3 $0 $0 $4,976,000 $4,976,000 Hank Johnson D-4 $26,688,000 $24,785,750 $14,763,000 $66,236,750 John Lewis D-5 $24,529,000 $18,009,500 $15,135,500 $57,674,000 Tom Price R-6 $0 $0 $2,705,000 $2,705,000 John Linder R-7 $1,000,000 $0 $2,255,000 $3,255,000 Jim Marshall D-8 $40,781,000 $31,510,000 $50,070,500 $122,361,500 Nathan Deal R-9 $2,092,000 $0 $8,552,000 $10,644,000 Paul Broun R-10 $0 $0 $0 $0 Phil Gingrey R-11 $15,800,000 $48,537,750 $29,696,500 $94,034,250 John Barrow D-12 $5,350,000 $15,046,000 $21,280,000 $41,676,000 David Scott D-13 $38,828,000 $27,940,500 $13,432,500 $80,201,000 Tom Graves R-14 n/a n/a n/a n/a Source: Open Secrets website To double-check our numbers, we reached out to Taxpayers for Common Sense, who provides the raw data for the searchable Open Secrets site. The nonprofit, with staffers who have worked for both Democrats and Republicans, shows slightly different tallies for those years – but comes to the same broad conclusion. It counts 146 earmarks from Kingston, totaling about $213 million. That compares with $116 million in earmarks from the other six GOP congressmen. Kingston, who represents five of Georgia’s eight military installations, noted that much of the funding was for defense or military spending such as an IED simulator at Fort Stewart and hospital renovations at installations statewide. Kingston contrasted that record with Perdue’s, whose business record includes a brief leadership of Pillowtex, a troubled North Carolina textile firm that went under shortly after he left. "The majority of what we did was for the military," Kingston said. "I don’t know that we need lectures on fiscal responsibility from somebody with his abysmal track record." In isolation, those costs don’t appear to be a problem, said Steve Ellis, the vice president of Taxpayers For Common Sense. But money spent there is money not available for other projects that may be more critical. But without the procurement process that follows other federal spending, there’s no way to judge the merit of the projects being funded, he said. "If a congressman is saying they know their district better than a pointed-headed bureaucrat, that’s absolutely true," Ellis said. "But with earmarks, they’re saying they know what’s best for all 435 congressional districts. And that’s not true at all." Perdue said Kingston had more earmarks than any other congressman in the state and more than Georgia’s other GOP congressmen combined. Two separate databases back him up. It’s up to voters to decide whether that’s a good thing or a bad thing. There is one caveat to Perdue’s claim. It covers three years, and Kingston has been in office for two decades. It’s that bit of context that moves it down just a notch on the Truth-O-Meter. We rate Perdue’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-05263	Says Sen. Sherrod Brown "cast the deciding vote on the government takeover of health care."	false	/ohio/statements/2012/may/30/josh-mandel/josh-mandel-says-sherrod-brown-cast-deciding-vote-/	Republican Josh Mandel, the Ohio state treasurer hoping to unseat incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown from his U.S. Senate seat in November, makes the most of the 30 seconds in his TV ad "Change." The campaign spot makes at least five separate claims about the two candidates. PolitiFact Ohio will take a look at several of them in the days ahead. For this factcheck item we’ll look at the statement that Brown "cast the deciding vote on the government takeover of health care." The statement claim caught our attention because it combines two claims we've examined before. To back it up, the commercial cites the Senate's roll call vote of Dec. 24, 2009, on H.R. 3590, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the health care reform law commonly known as Obamacare. Did Brown cast the deciding vote? That depends on how you define "deciding." Mandel's campaign and the National Republican Senatorial Committee both have explained their logic in crediting or blaming Brown for the deciding vote: The measure passed with the 60 votes that were required. Anything short of that would have effectively killed the legislation through the equivalent of a filibuster. Every vote is decisive, therefore every vote is "deciding," they say. The NRSC has made the same claim about other Democratic senators, too. There is, however, also this to consider: Before the votes were taken, Democrats and Republicans kept a count of supporters and opponents, and Democrats could only round up 59 proponents to end debate -- until Ben Nelson of Nebraska agreed to join in. News coverage on that day, Dec. 19, 2009, described Nelson as the crucial 60th vote to break the filibuster. Brown’s vote was actually the seventh "yes" among the 60 senators who supported a Senate bill that had to be reconciled with a House version on Christmas Eve 2009. His vote was cast early in the roll call, which is done in alphabetical order. When the two sides came together and the Senate voted on the final version, on March 25, 2010, Brown voted eighth. Both measures passed with exactly 60 votes. Brown's vote was crucial. Following the rationale of the Mandel camp and of the NRSC, any of those 60 votes could be called a deciding vote. But Brown did nothing (such as holding his support until the last moment) that would justify singling him out. What about the other part of the claim, where Mandel's ad refers to the health care act as "the government takeover of health care"? Mandel’s ad repeats a claim that has been reviewed numerous times by PolitiFact and rated False or Pants on Fire. PolitiFact national recognized it as the 2010 "Lie of the Year." FactCheck.org called it "nonsensical" and a "whopper," saying the reform plan is neither "government-run" nor a "government takeover." The Washington Post Fact Checker classified it as myth. It is true that the law does significantly increase government regulation of health insurers. But it is a system that relies on private companies and the free market. Contrary to the claim, more people will get private health coverage. The law does not include the public option, a government-run insurance plan that would have competed with private insurers. Brown’s vote for the health care reform legislation was crucial, but was it the deciding vote? A listener hearing the Mandel ad could be lead to believe Brown’s vote had more weight than other votes. Yet, he certainly did not cast the 60th vote, and he did not have to be wooed for support. And it is not accurate to state that he voted for a "government takeover of health care." On the Truth-O-Meter, this claim from Mandel’s ad rates False.	None	Josh Mandel	None	None	None	2012-05-30T06:00:00	2012-05-23	['None']
pomt-01848	The Obama administration "manipulated deportation data to make it appear that the Border Patrol was deporting more illegal immigrants than the Bush administration."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/15/lou-dobbs/lou-dobbs-obama-administration-manipulated-deporta/	If you want to make a point about immigration, there’s probably a statistic for you. Immigration numbers are often more complicated than they appear, and the mire induces partisan fights among those who consider President Barack Obama a record-setting "deporter-in-chief" and others who say he’s doing a lousy job securing the border and handling the influx of migrant children. An enduring claim about Obama’s deportation numbers from Fox Business Network’s Lou Dobbs epitomizes this issue. "They manipulated deportation data to make it appear that the Border Patrol was deporting more illegal immigrants than the Bush administration," Dobbs said July 1, 2014. "The Homeland Security secretary had to admit before Congress that was not the case -- that, in fact, they were manipulating the numbers." Dobbs is not only accusing the government of fudging the numbers to make Obama look tougher, he’s saying a Cabinet-level adviser admitted as much. We found some debate about the deportation numbers, but Dobbs goes too far in calling it a deliberate scheme. We’ll walk you through it. Crash course: Immigration lingo Defining deportations is not as easy as it sounds. In federal government lingo, official judicial or administrative orders to leave the country are called "removals," and they can happen right at the border or anywhere else on American soil. A removal is what most people would consider a deportation. But for people caught illegally crossing the border and simply turned around, there’s another term: "return." Unlike removals, a return does not bar someone from legally entering the country someday, though that is hard for most because they do not have a family or employment connection necessary to get in line for citizenship, said David Martin, a University of Virginia School of Law professor. Martin also worked as Immigration and Naturalization Service general counsel in the Clinton administration and as DHS deputy general counsel from 2009-10 under Obama. The Border Patrol primarily handles voluntary returns to Mexico, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, equipped with immigration judges and detention center beds, generally handles removals. Over the past several administrations, the Department of Homeland Security has shifted its immigration focus to undocumented immigrants who commit crimes or are caught at the border. The idea is to get them out, and keep them out. The shift picked up in the George W. Bush administration and intensified under Obama’s watch. Whereas many immigrants previously caught at the border simply were bused back to Mexico, they now are returned with official deportation orders, prosecuted, or moved to different parts of the border so they cannot reconnect with their smuggler, Martin said. In short, these people previously would have been classified as a "return," but the policy has been to put them through removal proceedings. As such, they are classified as a "removal." Counting removals Dobbs said the government is twisting its statistics to make it look like it’s deporting more people than Bush. He didn’t return our request for comment, but it’s likely he’s focusing on the policy shift we just described to formally remove people trying to cross the border. What he’s getting at: Obama is boosting his "removal" statistics by including people who used to be on the "return" list. To check the numbers, we turned to two different sources, though each has its problems. The first comes from Immigration and Customs Enforcement data. The following chart from the Bipartisan Policy Center reflects the trend of more total removals, according to ICE data. Starting in FY 2008, the data is broken down by interior removals and border removals. Breakdowns of removals prior to 2008 are not available. . The chart shows the total number of removals is up, and the share of removals from the border has been increasing since 2008. By 2013, 64 percent of the year’s 369,000 ICE removals were people who crossed the border and put through a formal process before leaving the country, a jump of 28 percentage points from 2008. The number of people deported from within the country fell accordingly, from 64 percent in 2008 to 36 percent in 2013. The second set of data from the Department of Homeland Security’s Yearbook of Immigration Statistics, which measures removals and returns separately for each fiscal year (Oct. 1-Sept. 30). It includes data from ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which houses the Border Patrol. The most recent data is through 2012. According to Homeland Security data, removals have indeed climbed over recent years, starting in 2006 and continuing under Obama. But returns, which don’t carry formal consequences, have gone down. The recession and increased border resources are partially credited for the decline in returns, as is the shift in policy. "To me, the thing that really stands out with the lower number of returns is fewer number of people are getting apprehended at the border in the first place," said Matt Graham, a Bipartisan Policy Center immigration analyst. "(Obama) has fewer opportunities to return people." Removals are highest on an annual basis under Obama, says Theresa Brown, Bipartisan Policy Center director of immigration policy. But if you factor in returns, Bush indeed outpaces Obama. "If you want to say that he’s removed more people than any other administration, then that’s true," Brown said. "If you want to say he hasn’t actually expelled more people than any other president, that might also be true." People should be more precise so we know exactly what they mean by "deportation," Brown said. "It’s the difference between getting off with a warning and going to court." ‘Manipulating deportation data’ So that’s a look at the data -- and why it can be confusing. Now we want to look at Dobbs’ accusation that the Obama administration "manipulated deportation data to make it appear that the Border Patrol was deporting more illegal immigrants than the Bush administration." This, too, goes back to the policy change of how people crossing the border illegally are handled. Usually pundits and politicians say ICE is the agency inflating its numbers by formally removing people handed over from the Border Patrol. "These numbers show that the president is hardly the deporter-in-chief as so many of the ethnic advocacy groups have tried to paint him," said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that opposes Obama’s proposed immigration reforms. Right-leaning news sites and pundits revived these claims after Department of Homeland Secretary Jeh Johnson appeared before a House subcommittee to answer questions about his budget requests. Rep. John Culberson, R-Texas, tried to drill down into the agency’s methodology, and Johnson noted a large chunk of the 368,644 people deported by ICE in 2013 were essentially caught at the border. (Again, we’re talking about how people were previously handled as a "return" but are now processed as a "removal" with consequences.) Culberson: "But under the Obama administration, more than half of those removals that were attributed to ICE are actually a result of Border Patrol arrests that wouldn't have been counted in prior administrations." Johnson: "Correct." The "correct" was heard around the conservative blogosphere, with some sites taking it as Johnson finally admitting administrative malpractice. Vaughan’s Center for Immigration Studies billed it as "a truth finally admitted" that ICE is taking credit for arrests made by Border Patrol agents to beef up its deportation numbers. But is the change in tactics a manipulation of data? Experts we talked to said no. "Under these previous administrations, they would have been voluntarily returned, not formally removed," Brown said. "Now they are formally removed." "Transferring of people from Border Patrol to ICE is not trying to trick the numbers," said Alex Nowrasteh, a Cato Institute immigration policy analyst. "It’s a result of punishing illegal immigrants more heavily than they did before." Our ruling Dobbs said the federal government "manipulated deportation data to make it appear that the Border Patrol was deporting more illegal immigrants than the Bush administration." Deportations or "removals" under Obama are tracking higher than during the Bush years using the most literal deportation statistics, as well as those solely from ICE. Dobbs’ contention that the Obama administration is inflating its number is an interpretation of a change in federal policy to process and remove people trying to enter the country illegally rather than just turn them around. Whether you agree with the policy, those formal removals are occurring. That strategy is rooted in previous administrations but was accelerated by Obama so that people trying to cross the border illegally face more significant consequences and receive formal deportation orders. We rate the claim False.	None	Lou Dobbs	None	None	None	2014-07-15T11:00:00	2014-07-01	['Barack_Obama', 'George_W._Bush', 'United_States_Border_Patrol']
pomt-01132	Says President Barack Obama has said "that everybody should hate the police."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/dec/23/rudy-giuliani/giuliani-obama-propaganda-says-everybody-should-ha/	Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani blamed President Barack Obama for anti-police "propaganda" that eventually led to the shooting death of two New York City police officers. The Dec. 20 shooting happened amid rising tension between the black community and law enforcement across the country over racial disparities in the criminal justice system. Commenting on the shooting on Fox News, Giuliani said politicians’ rhetoric, as well as protests, exacerbate the tension. "We’ve had four months of propaganda, starting with the president, that everybody should hate the police," Giuliani said. "The protests are being embraced, the protests are being encouraged. The protests, even the ones that don’t lead to violence, a lot of them lead to violence, all of them lead to a conclusion: The police are bad, the police are racist. That is completely wrong." Giuliani’s claim that Obama said something akin to "everybody should hate the police" struck us as overheated right off the bat, so we decided to look into it. We asked Giuliani for a response but we didn't hear back. Almost one month ago, Giuliani faced backlash for some controversial remarks about race and the criminal justice system. He questioned why the same Americans protesting black deaths at the hands of white police officers do not voice similar outrage about black-on-black crime. In response to his most recent comments, we sifted through Obama’s statements and interviews on the subject since August, when the situation first bubbled up after a white police officer killed black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. Even the most distorted readings of Obama’s remarks cannot be interpreted as encouraging people to "hate the police." Obama has repeatedly emphasized that the work police do is dangerous to themselves but very important to the community. He has said that although "a gulf of mistrust exists between local residents and law enforcement" (an oft-repeated talking point), the vast majority of law enforcement officers do not carry out the law in a discriminatory manner. He has also argued that improvement -- achieved through peaceful and cooperative means -- is necessary. Part of Giuliani’s point is that Obama has been empathetic to the protesters, which he has been -- though cautiously so. And he has always discouraged violent protests and excessive police response. Here’s a selection of telling passages from Obama’s comments on race and the criminal justice system since August. We fail to see how they support Guiliani’s point. Aug. 14, Obama's first statement following Brown's death: There is never an excuse for violence against police, or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting. There’s also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests, or to throw protestors in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights.... Put simply, we all need to hold ourselves to a high standard, particularly those of us in positions of authority. Aug. 18, Obama’s second statement following Brown’s death: I’ve said this before -- in too many communities around the country, a gulf of mistrust exists between local residents and law enforcement... This is not an argument that there isn’t real crime out there, and that law enforcement doesn't have a difficult job and that they have to be honored and respected for the danger and difficulty of law enforcement. Sept. 28, speech at the Congressional Black Caucus awards dinner: In too many communities around the country, a gulf of mistrust exists between local residents and law enforcement… One recent poll showed that the majority of Americans think the criminal justice system doesn’t treat people of all races equally…. And that has a corrosive effect -- not just on the black community; it has a corrosive effect on America. It harms the communities that need law enforcement the most. It makes folks who are victimized by crime and need strong policing reluctant to go to the police because they may not trust them. Nov. 24, remarks following a grand jury’s decision not to indict the officer who shot Brown: Understand, our police officers put their lives on the line for us every single day. They’ve got a tough job to do to maintain public safety and hold accountable those who break the law…. The fact is, in too many parts of this country, a deep distrust exists between law enforcement and communities of color. Some of this is the result of the legacy of racial discrimination in this country. And this is tragic, because nobody needs good policing more than poor communities with higher crime rates…. There are issues in which the law too often feels as if it is being applied in discriminatory fashion. I don't think that's the norm. I don't think that's true for the majority of communities or the vast majority of law enforcement officials. But these are real issues. Dec. 1, remarks after meeting with community and law enforcement Ferguson laid bare a problem that is not unique to St. Louis or that area, and is not unique to our time, and that is a simmering distrust that exists between too many police departments and too many communities of color…. We also heard law enforcement and were reminded of what a tough job it is to be in law enforcement. Whether you’re in a big city or in a small community, as (Attorney General) Eric Holder put it, police officers have the right to come home. And if they’re in dangerous circumstances, we have to be able to put ourselves in their shoes and recognize that they do have a tough job. Dec. 3, remarks after grand jury decision not to indict New York City officers involved in death of Eric Garner I say that as somebody who believes that law enforcement has an incredibly difficult job, that every man or woman in uniform are putting their lives at risk to protect us, that they have the right to come home, just like we do from our jobs, that there’s real crime out there that they’ve got to tackle day in and day out -- but that they’re only going to be able to do their job effectively if everybody has confidence in the system. And right now, unfortunately, we are seeing too many instances where people just do not have confidence that folks are being treated fairly. And in some cases, those may be misperceptions; but in some cases, that’s a reality. Dec. 8, interview with BET And one of the things that I want us to make sure we understand is that, communities of color need good law enforcement. I mean, there’s a lot of crime, and one of the things that we talked about on Monday here was you’ve got young people who end up getting caught between police that they don’t trust and folks on the streets who are trying to rough them up…. And I’ve said it before: The vast majority of law enforcement officers are doing a really tough job, and most of them are doing it well and are trying to do the right thing. But a combination of bad training, in some cases; a combination in some cases of departments that really are not trying to root out biases, or tolerate sloppy police work; a combination in some cases of folks just not knowing any better, and in a lot of cases, subconscious fear of folks who look different -- all of this contributes to a national problem that’s going to require a national solution. Our ruling Giuliani said Obama has said "that everybody should hate the police." Throughout all of his comments since August, when the latest unrest over racial disparities in the criminal justice system began, Obama has continuously encouraged working with police to find solutions and make change. He has also repeatedly emphasized the importance of law enforcement in communities of color and the fact that police officers have a dangerous job. Giuliani’s claim is an outlandish distortion of what Obama actually said. We rate this Pants on Fire.

pomt-14440	Says Michael Bennet wants to close Guantanamo Bay prison and bring terrorists "right here to Colorado."	false	/colorado/statements/2016/mar/08/jon-keyser/jon-keyser-says-michael-bennet-wants-bring-gitmo-t/	Even before President Barack Obama sent a plan to Congress to close the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Republican opponents were accusing Colorado's incumbent Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet of pushing to "bring terrorists" to a Colorado prison. No one's banged the drum louder against Bennet than Jon Keyser, who's among more than a dozen GOP candidates vying to claim Bennet's Senate seat in the November general election. "We have about 90 terrorists that are left at Guantanamo Bay. Michael Bennet wants to close Guantanamo Bay with the president, and bring them right here to Colorado," Keyser said at a Feb. 11 GOP Senate candidates' forum at the University of Denver. Keyser and his campaign have made similar statements at other campaign stops, in news releases and on social media. We looked at Bennet’s record over the years on the Guantanamo Bay prison -- informally called "Gitmo" -- for evidence that he advocated bringing suspected terrorists to Colorado. Bennet's closing conditions Since 2009, Bennet has backed Obama's plan to close the Guantanamo Bay prison, saying: "I do support the closure because I think it is an important signal to the rest of the world about our devotion to the rule of law." The United States has faced international criticism about the treatment of prisoners at Gitmo, and some Western countries have said the accused terrorists should be granted prisoner of war protections under the Geneva Conventions. However, Bennet has placed conditions on his support for relocating Gitmo detainees from the start. He said they are being tried in military tribunals, so if they are moved to the United States, they should be held in a military prison. He also has pressed the administration to provide a plan on relocating detainees and consult with local and state officials before prisoners are moved. "President Obama and his administration owe the American people a much more detailed plan of what they are going to do with the detainees," Bennet said in 2009. Colorado doesn't have a military prison, and Bennet opposes housing detainees in the state’s civilian prisons, including the U.S. Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility in Florence -- known as ADX or "supermax" -- the highest-security federal prison in the country. In May 2009, Obama pledged to close the Guantanamo prison by January 2010. The move, without a plan of where the prisoners would be relocated, irked congressional lawmakers. On May 20, 2009, Bennet voted with fellow senators to reject an effort to spend $80 million to close the Guantanamo Bay prison and to relocate the terrorism suspects, possibly to U.S. prisons. But an amendment Bennet backed to prohibit funding to transfer Gitmo detainees to the United States was stripped out of the bill by a conference committee that irons out legislative language differences between Senate and House bills. Bennet did not serve on that committee. A freshman senator, Bennet got into a dust-up during the 2009 debate with senior California Sen. Dianne Feinstein -- a fellow Democrat -- who said in a floor speech that Colorado’s supermax prison would be a perfect home for Gitmo detainees. "This facility houses not only drug kingpins, serial murderers and gang leaders, but also terrorists who have already been convicted of crimes in this country," she said. Bennet disagreed in a statement, saying, "I strongly support the Senate's decision to withhold funding for the transfer of the detainees until the Administration comes up with a plan for the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. Because the detainees are being tried by military tribunals, they should be held in military facilities. Military detainees should not be transported to and held at Supermax because it is not a military facility." In the same 2009 bill, Bennet voted for a Republican senator's nonbinding resolution calling on the defense secretary to consult with state and local government officials before making any decision about where Guantanamo detainees may be transferred if Gitmo was closed by a presidential executive order. We asked the Keyser campaign for evidence supporting the candidate’s claim that Bennet wants to "bring [terrorists] right here to Colorado." Keyser campaign spokesman Matt Connelly replied that "Bennet knew that Colorado was at the top of the list" of U.S. prisons where the Obama administration has considered transferring Gitmo detainees. He cited a 2009 address in which Obama suggested that Supermax could be a potential home for detainees. "As we make these decisions, bear in mind the following fact: Nobody has ever escaped from one of our federal supermax prisons, which hold hundreds of convicted terrorists," Obama said. Yet, other prisons have also been reported as possible replacements for Gitmo, including military facilities like Fort Leavenworth, Kan., or the U.S. Navy brig in Charleston, S.C. Connelly said that Bennet has voted against two Republican amendments to ban the transfer of Gitmo detainees to the United States. He also voted against an amendment to block funds to prepare U.S. facilities to house detainees. Connelly said such votes effectively laid the groundwork for Gitmo detainees to be transferred to the United States, including Colorado. "It’s laughable that after years of silence, Sen. Bennet is now arguing that he didn’t want to send Gitmo terrorists to Colorado, even though he voted three times to make it happen," he said. Keyser's case Let’s examine the Keyser campaign’s defense of its candidate’s claims. They point to Bennet’s 2013 vote against an amendment by Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire that would have prohibited the transfer of detainees from Guantanamo bay to facilities in the United States. Congressional records confirm Bennet’s vote that helped kill the amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for the 2014 fiscal year. Bennet spokesman Adam Bozzi said Bennet disagreed with the Ayotte amendment’s requirements about how the Defense Department certifies the security of a foreign government before a Guantanamo detainee could be transferred to that country. Bennet supported another proposal for safeguards on transferring detainees to foreign countries, Bozzi said. Ultimately, Bennet voted with an 84-to-15 Senate majority for a compromise on Guantanamo, which retained a one-year ban on transferring detainees to the United States while easing the transfer of detainees to foreign countries. It was part of the defense-funding bill that was signed into law. Keyser’s spokesman added that Bennet also voted against a 2012 amendment by Ayotte to block funding for transferring Guantanamo detainees to the United States. But Bennet’s spokesman counters that the senator voted against the amendment because it would have imposed a permanent ban on funding the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to the United States, which a legislative report confirmed. The amendment would have also blocked other Obama administration options, including prosecuting detainees in a federal court in the United States. Given that Bennet supports closing Gitmo and potentially moving some detainees to a U.S. military prison, the senator opposed the permanent ban, his spokesman said. The permanent domestic-transfer ban amendment and a similar House amendment were left out of the final version of the 2013 defense appropriations bill to avoid a threatened White House veto. Records show Bennet instead voted for a one-year ban on transferring detainees to the United States that was included in the 2013 defense-funding bill. Lastly, the Keyser campaign points to Bennet’s 2009 vote to kill a Republican amendment that would have barred the use of funds to construct or modify prisons in the United States or its territories to hold Guantanamo Bay detainees. Bozzi, Bennet’s spokesman, again noted that Bennet, who supports closing Gitmo and moving at least some detainees to a U.S. military prison, of course opposed the amendment that would have blocked construction funding that could be used to prepare a military prison to securely hold the prisoners. "I’ve repeatedly said I do not support the transfer of prisoners from the Guantanamo Bay military facility to Colorado," Bennet said recently in response to President Obama sending his Guantanamo-closure plan to Congress. "I’ve voted to close the prison, but I believe military detainees should be held in military prisons. Colorado does not have that type of facility. This plan has done nothing to change my mind. These detainees should not be transferred to Colorado." Our ruling Keyser said, "We have about 90 terrorists that are left at Guantanamo Bay. Michael Bennet wants to close Guantanamo Bay with the president, and bring them right here to Colorado." Keyser’s campaign pointed to Bennet’s votes against a permanent ban on transferring detainees to a U.S. military prison and his opposition to blocking construction funding for a prison to hold Gitmo prisoners in the United States. While Bennet has long supported closing the Guantanamo Bay prison, his statements and legislative record show that, since 2009, Bennet has opposed attempts to relocate detainees from Guantanamo to a Colorado prison, including Colorado’s federal supermax prison. Bennet has said repeatedly he thinks detainees should be held in military prisons, and there is no military prison in Colorado. We rate the statement False.

pomt-08483	"Groups that receive foreign money are spending huge sums to influence American elections."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/11/barack-obama/president-barack-obama-says-foreign-money-coming-u/	Stumping for Democratic candidates in the past few weeks, President Barack Obama has repeatedly warned that foreign money may be bankrolling many of the attack ads being run against Democrats. And now he says he has found an Exhibit A: the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Here's what the president said at a rally on Oct. 7, 2010, on behalf of Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley: "Just this week, we learned that one of the largest groups paying for these ads regularly takes in money from foreign corporations. So groups that receive foreign money are spending huge sums to influence American elections. And they won't tell you where the money (for) their ads comes from." On ABC's This Week on Oct. 10, 2010, George Will connected the dots: "Well, he won't tell us who he's talking about. He's talking about the Chamber of Commerce, which does indeed receive dues from foreign entities that are associated with American business, just as the AFL-CIO receives dues from foreign entities associated with it. And -- and the shock and awe that we're supposed to feel from this is somewhat selective." We have looked previously at more general Obama administration claims about foreign money financing attack ads against Democrats. We will take a look at Will's retort about the AFL-CIO in a separate fact-check. But here, we will examine Obama's claim about the Chamber, that, "Groups that receive foreign money are spending huge sums to influence American elections." For example, the chamber has run ads against Democratic U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson in Florida, calling him a "lap dog" who supports "job-skilling energy taxes." The Chamber has also run ads against Senate candidates Charlie Crist in Florida and Richard Blumenthal in Connecticut, attacking them for supporting the health care law. Current federal law prohibits "a partnership, association, corporation, organization, or other combination of persons organized under the laws of or having its principal place of business in a foreign country" from making "directly or indirectly" a donation or expenditure "in connection with a Federal, State, or local election," to a political party committee or "for an electioneering communication." But Obama has repeatedly warned that a Supreme Court ruling in the Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission case opened the floodgates for special interests -– including foreign corporations (a claim many Republicans dispute). With independent groups outspending the actual campaigns in some midterm elections -- the Chamber has vowed to spend more than $50 million nationwide -- it's a theme that has been oft-repeated by Democratic party leaders lately. A video released by the Democratic National Committee states that "it appears they are even taking secret foreign money to influence our elections." First off, White House officials confirmed Obama's comment was, in fact, aimed at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. And when Obama said "just this week, we learned...," he's referring to a posting on ThinkProgress, a blog affiliated with the liberal Center for American Progress, which ran under the headline "Exclusive: Foreign-Funded 'U.S.' Chamber Of Commerce Running Partisan Attack Ads." The article details the Chamber of Commerce's many overseas affiliates, and claims the Chamber has "spearheaded an effort to raise money from foreign corporations, including ones controlled by foreign governments." The article claims foreign members of the Chamber send money either directly to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, or the foreign members fund their local Chamber, which in turn, transfers dues payments back to the Chamber, and that the funds are commingled with an account used to pay for the attack ads. Chamber officials readily acknowledged their group has 115 foreign member affiliates in 108 countries, and that it received foreign money. But Bruce Josten, chief lobbyist for the chamber, told the New York Times that overseas American Chambers of Commerce pay a total of less than $100,000 in membership dues that go into its general fund. In addition, the Chamber gets membership dues from foreign corporations. While the total was not quantified, Josten said it amounts to a small fraction of the group's total budget of more than $200 million. More importantly, the Chamber maintains that none of that foreign money is used to finance the Chamber's political agenda in the United States. The Chamber put out a statement saying all foreign money received by the organization is properly segregated from money used to fund political activity. "We're careful to ensure that we comply with all applicable laws," Chamber spokeswoman Tita Freeman said in a statement. "No foreign money is used to fund political activities. All allegations to the contrary are totally and completely false." According to ThinkProgress, however, "while the Chamber will likely assert it has internal controls, foreign money is fungible, permitting the Chamber to run its unprecedented attack campaign." But here's the thing: Neither Obama nor the DNC offer any evidence that foreign money is actually being used to fund the attack ads. Rather, the argument is that it could be a problem. "We simply don't know," said Dave Levinthal, a spokesman for the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. As a 501 (c)6 non-profit trade association, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is not required to disclose its donors. And it doesn't. Foreign companies with American divisions can form PACs and collect contributions from their American employees, or those with green cards. The Center for Responsive Politics lists more than 140 foreign-connected PACs, from pharmaceuticals like GlaxoSmithKline to BP. These PACS have raised more than $12 million this election cycle. "The law of the land right now is that if an organization like the Chamber of Commerce is using generally accepted accounting principles to show that you are not using foreign money to finance regulated activities, then you're in the clear," said Paul Ryan, an attorney for the Campaign Legal Center. "It is hard with no disclosure to pin it down," David G. Vance, a spokesman for the Campaign Legal Center. "That's the big problem. There's no way to check any of it. As it is, they just have one big pie, and no one knows where it all goes." So far, though, no one has offered any evidence that the Chamber of Commerce is not complying with that law. "It's unverifiable," Levinthal said. "You've got to take their word for it. There is no way to tell, unless the group wants to put up identifiable evidence on its own...The Chamber of Commerce is not volunteering that information. Nor do they have to by law." Levinthal cautioned that it's not just a problem with right-leaning groups. The same rules apply whether you are a left group or a right one, Levinthal noted. A New York Times story by Eric Lichtblau sums it up this way: "A closer examination shows that there is little evidence that what the chamber does in collecting overseas dues is improper or even unusual, according to both liberal and conservative election-law lawyers and campaign finance documents. "In fact, the controversy over the Chamber of Commerce financing may say more about the Washington spin cycle — where an Internet blog posting can be quickly picked up by like-minded groups and become political fodder for the president himself — than it does about the vagaries of campaign finance." Some Republicans say the Democrats' stance amounts to "guilty until proven innocent." David Axelrod, the president's senior adviser, was asked by Bob Schieffer on CBS' Face the Nation on Oct. 10, 2010, if he had any evidence that the chamber was using secret foreign funds to influence the election. ''Well, do you have any evidence that it's not, Bob?'' Mr. Axelrod said. ''The fact is that the chamber has asserted that, but they won't release any information about where their campaign money is coming from. And that's at the core of the problem here.'' President Obama and other Democrats may have a legitimate concern about disclosure. The campaign finance experts we spoke with said there's no way to know for sure if the Chamber of Commerce is keeping foreign money it receives separate from the pot of money used to fund attack ads -- other than the Chamber's assurances that it does. And the president is technically correct when he says the Chamber of Commerce "takes in money from foreign corporations ... So groups that receive foreign money are spending huge sums to influence American elections." But we think that statement suggests foreign money is, for sure, being used to directly fund the attack ads. The Chamber said it isn't. And Obama and other Democrats have offered no evidence so far that it has. And so we rule his statement Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2010-10-11T19:30:43	2010-10-07	['United_States']
pomt-01866	"There are more than 46 million Americans living in poverty today -- the largest number in 54 years."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2014/jul/11/kirk-cox/kirk-cox-says-number-americans-poverty-historic-hi/	House Majority Leader Kirk Cox, R-Colonial Heights, recently objected to Democrats’ claims of a moral high ground in their bid to expand the state’s Medicaid rolls. During a floor speech, Cox laid out reasons for the House GOP’s refusal to make Medicaid available to as many 400,000 additional low income and disabled Virginians -- despite the federal government’s offer to pay almost all the costs. He said the expansion was a broadening of ineffective Great Society programs, including Medicaid, that began under President Lyndon Johnson in the mid-1960s. Despite Johnson’s goal of launching a "war against poverty," Cox said blight persists. "There are more than 46 million Americans living in poverty today -- the largest number in 54 years," Cox said. There’s been a lot written about whether Great Society programs have succeeded. Coming to a conclusion on that debate is beyond the purview of a single Truth-O-Meter. But we were curious whether Cox is correct in saying more Americans are living in poverty than at any time during the last 54 years. Kelly Gee, Cox’s legislative aide, pointed us to figures from the U.S. Census Bureau. They show that in 2012, the latest year that figures were available, 46.5 million Americans lived in poverty. That’s the highest number going back to 1960, when 39.9 million lived below the poverty line. But several analysts told us economists typically measure poverty over time by examining the poverty rate -- the percentage of the population living in blight. While the number of people in poverty has risen, so has the nation’s population. In 1960, there were 179.5 million people in the U.S. and by 2012 that grew to 310.6 million. "It is important to put any number in context," emailed Greg Acs, director of the Income and Benefits Policy center at the Urban Institute. "If the population is growing, the number of people in any income category is likely to grow as well." The 1960 poverty rate was 22.2 percent. Had it stayed at that level, there would be 70 million Americans in poverty today, said David Betson, an associate professor of public policy and economics at the University of Notre Dame. "Both numbers are important, but when looking at poverty over a long period when population is growing, poverty rates in my opinion are a better indicator than the number of people in poverty to judge whether we have made progress or not," Betson wrote in an e-mail. The poverty rate in 2012 -- the latest year available -- was 15 percent. While it has dropped since 1960, the rate is high compared to more recent years. The rate has has hovered at 15 percent for a three-year period beginning in 2010. That’s the longest stretch at or above that threshold since 1959-1965, when the poverty rate started at 22.4 percent and wound up at 17.3 percent. "We are at very high levels of poverty, one of the highest streaks in recorded history," said H. Luke Shaefer, an assistant professor of social work at the University of Michigan. "We’ve been high since the start of the Great Recession. We are also at some of the highest levels of deep poverty." The average poverty threshold in 2013, the latest year available, is $15,156 annual income for a family of two and $23,836 for a family of four. Our ruling In arguing the Great Society programs have failed, Cox said more than 46.5 million Americans are living in poverty, more than at any time since 1960. Cox’s figures are correct, but offer an incomplete picture of the U.S. poverty over the last 54 years. What he fails to note is that the U.S. population has grown by 73 percent over that span -- or by about 131 million people. Analysts say a fuller measure is offered by poverty rate, which takes into account population growth. It shows that poverty has decreased, from 22.2 percent in 1960 to 15 percent in 2012 -- the latest year available. So Cox’s statement is accurate but, in its context of evaluating a half-century poverty trend line, needs additional information. That makes it Mostly True.

pomt-06864	"For the second quarter in a row, my campaign has raised more money than any other challenger in the nation and brought our fundraising total to over $800,000."	true	/florida/statements/2011/aug/02/patrick-murphy/allen-west-challenger-says-he-has-raised-more-mone/	Democrats may not yet agree on who offers the best chance to beat U.S. Rep. Allen West in 2012, but they all know this: it will take a lot of money. West raised more than $6.5 million in 2010 for his successful campaign against incumbent Democrat Ron Klein in a Broward/Palm Beach swing district. And he's only gotten more popular in many Republican circles since going to Washington. West has become something of a spokesman for the tea party movement (which also makes him a lightning rod for criticism), having appeared on NBC's Meet the Press as well as being a frequent guest on Fox News. West already has raised more than $2.2 million through the first two quarters of 2011. Yet Democrats think West may be vulnerable in a South Florida district that they say might not fully embrace his tea party mentality. Already, two Democrats have filed to run against him in 2012: former West Palm Beach mayor and state legislator Lois Frankel and Patrick Murphy, a 28-year-old businessman. Murphy -- a former Republican who switched party affiliation in January 2011 -- has never run for political office in his life, but on July 16, 2011, he claimed that he has raised more cash than any other congressional challenger in the country. "For the second quarter in a row, my campaign has raised more money than any other challenger in the nation and brought our fundraising total to over $800,000," he said on his website. "Some political insiders doubted we would be able to do it again, but our second quarter haul of over $450,000 proves that not only are people fed up with Allen West but that I am the candidate they want to replace him." Has Murphy two quarters in a row raised more money than any other challenger in the nation -- over $800,000? Through June 30 (the first two quarters of 2011), Murphy raised $808,671.59, according to the Federal Election Commission. The amount includes no loans, but Murphy did donate $36,100 to the campaign. (A donation is different from a loan in that Murphy has no expectation he'll be repaid.) We called the Federal Election Commission -- the repository of Congressional campaign finance reports -- and asked spokesman Christian Hilland if Murphy had raised more than any other congressional challenger in the nation two quarters in a row. Based on campaign finance reports submitted to the FEC, Hilland sent us back a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet of the top 10 fundraisers among congressional challengers in the first and second quarters in 2011. The chart shows that during the first quarter, Jan. 1 through March 31, 2011, Murphy took in about $352,448.99. He took in $456,222.60 during the second quarter, April 1 through June 30, 2011. A few other fundraisers taking on incumbents did take in more than Murphy in the first or second quarter. But they only surpassed Murphy because they either gave themselves large loans or because they transferred money from a U.S. Senate campaign. • John Atkinson of Illinois raised $173,550.18 more than Murphy in the first quarter of 2011 but included a $270,000 loan. (Atkinson dropped out of his House race in June 2011.) • Abel Maldonado of California raised $80,867.40 more than Murphy in the second quarter. But his figures included a $250,000 loan. And then there were two candidates from Texas with the last name of Williams who switched their campaigns from the U.S. Senate to the U.S. House. • Roger Williams' total for the second quarter was $1,017,535, but he launched his U.S. Senate campaign in 2008 and then switched to a congressional race in June 2011. • Michael Williams raised $418,619.20 during the first quarter, which was $66,170.21 more than Murphy's, but he launched his U.S. Senate campaign in 2008 and then switched to a congressional race in June 2011. For the record, Murphy's Democratic primary opponent also made the top 10 list: Frankel raised $698,545.88 for the first two quarters combined. Murphy said, "For the second quarter in a row, my campaign has raised more money than any other challenger in the nation and brought our fundraising total to over $800,000." A couple of other candidates technically raised more money, but that is thanks to either personal campaign loans or switching from a statewide U.S. Senate campaign to a run for the House. We think Murphy is on solid footing to leave those scenarios out when making his claim. So, we rate it True.	None	Patrick Murphy	None	None	None	2011-08-02T09:05:23	2011-07-16	['None']
pomt-07871	"Before this law was passed, Americans were told they could keep their current health care plans. After it became law, the administration issued regulations stating nearly half of Americans would lose their current plan."	half-true	/florida/statements/2011/feb/08/bill-posey/rep-bill-posey-claims-nearly-half-will-lose-curren/	Do you have a one-in-two chance of losing your health care plan as a result of the 2010 health care law? That's what Republican Congressman Bill Posey, who represents Florida's 15th District in Central Florida, claims in a Feb. 1, 2011, letter to Florida Today. He wrote to explain to voters "which aspects of the health care law I’m against," and this was his first point: "Before this law was passed, Americans were told they could keep their current health care plans. After it became law, the administration issued regulations stating nearly half of Americans would lose their current plan." He also argued that the law will not produce savings in health care costs, nor will it reduce health care spending. But for this fact-check, we are going to look at Posey's first statement. Before the health care law passed, were Americans told they could keep their current plans? And after the law passed, did the federal government issue regulations that result in nearly half of Americans losing their current plans? On Feb. 4, Posey spokesman George Cecala sent us two 2009 videos of Obama posted on You Tube. In the first video, Obama said: "If you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan. Period. No one will take it away. No matter what." In the second video, he said: "If you like your doctor or health care plan, you can keep it." Three experts on the health care law whom we interviewed all agreed the message was clear: Obama told Americans that they could keep their health plan. Our experts are Michael Tanner, senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, which has been critical of the health care law; Edwin Park, co-director on health policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which has supported the health care law; and Gerard Anderson, a professor and director at the Center for Hospital Finance and Management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. The second part of Posey's claim -- that nearly half of Americans would lose their current plan -- is more complicated. Our colleagues at National PolitiFact reviewed a similar claim on Feb. 2 by Texas Republican Blake Farenthold, that the health care law would force 70 percent of workers to "lose their current health plan." Here's what we found: How grandfathering works The law allows plans that existed on March 23, 2010, to be "grandfathered," which means that they do not have to comply with new requirements that took effect last fall, such as providing preventive services without cost-sharing and direct access to ob-gyn care without a referral. To keep their grandfathered status, these plans must not significantly cut benefits or increase out-of-pocket spending for consumers. (Minor policy changes and increases to keep pace with medical inflation do not threaten a plan’s grandfather status.) A fact sheet provided by the Obama administration on HealthCare.gov estimates how many plans are expected to opt for grandfathered status, both for the 133 million Americans whose plans are provided by large employers and the 43 million with plans provided by small employers (fewer than 100 employees). Together, those groups account for 91 percent of insured Americans. According to administration projections, between 36 and 66 percent of the large-employer plans will remain grandfathered by 2013. For small employers, the administration expects between 20 and 51 percent to be grandfathered in 2013. Cecala also sent us a link to a June 2010 Federal Register report that looks at how many employer plans will relinquish their grandfathered status in 2013, rather than how many retain it. Table 3 estimates between 39 and 69 percent of all employer plans will relinquish that status. So Posey's claim refers to plans that will lose their grandfathered status, and "nearly half" is clearly within the government's own estimates. But the question is whether losing grandfathered status means the same thing as losing your current plan. Just because a consumer's plan loses its grandfathered status doesn't mean he or she will be forced to switch to an entirely different provider or a radically different plan. What PolitiFact found The Truth-O-Meter on Farenthold summarized it this way: "Health care specialists said they expect that in many cases an employer (or the insurance carrier the employer uses) will change the plan in ways that are significant enough to end grandfather status but which will not terminate the plan or result in a radical change in its coverage. While some employers may decide to end health care coverage entirely (and thus pay a penalty under the law), many will continue to offer a similar plan but perhaps with more extensive requirements mandated under the law, possibly along with higher premiums." Also, when Obama made his promise that Americans could keep their plans, he failed to acknowledge that many Americans already don't keep their "current" plan every year. Insurers change rules and costs, employers switch providers, and Americans lose or change jobs or retire, effectively switching their plans. That is something that Farenthold, and now Posey, also fail to explain. The Feb. 2 Truth-O-Meter attempted to quantify how many Americans switch plans unrelated to the new law and found a study by Mercer, a private consulting firm that does an annual national survey of employer-sponsored health plans. Beth Umland, the head of research for Mercer's health and benefits consulting practice, said that in each of the years from 2005 to 2008, roughly 25 percent of companies said they made changes to their plans that would result in employees paying a greater share of the cost. In 2009 and 2010, she said, that percentage rose to one-third of companies. PolitiFact concluded that the data is too scattershot to know how many workers change plans every year, but it seems reasonable to assume that the number is not trivial. The experts on grandfathering Our experts also weighed in on the second part of Posey's claims. Park said he wouldn't equate grandfathering with losing your health plan. "Let's say the same plan loses grandfathering status because it raises the deductible," Park said, but employees are kept on a revised Blue Cross plan. "It's still a Blue Cross plan -- it's the same insurer, the same rules, the same providers being covered, and now it doesn't have the grandfathered status. Essentially it's the same plan with some changes to comply with the health reform law. The rhetoric implies that the plan is completely different. ... 'Losing your plan' makes it sound like you are being forced out of your plan into something else completely. These kinds of changes happen all the time, and it happens today with or without the enactment of the health care law." Anderson also agreed that losing grandfathered status shouldn't be equated with consumers losing a plan. Tanner explained: "Over time the current plans are likely to go away and the new plans will all meet the government's requirements. To some degree, that is an advantage for people who get benefits they don't get now, but it will also likely cost them more to do so. It's a little bit like telling everybody who has a Toyota now they have to get Lexus. They got more car, but it cost them more." And initially Americans were told they could keep that Toyota and now they can't, he said. While some consumers may not be forced from one plan to another -- say from Kaiser to Aetna -- consumers who have Blue Cross now may still have Blue Cross "but the plan itself will have different benefits and different costs." The differences will really affect smaller businesses that are offering bare bones coverage now and will have to provide more expensive policies, Tanner said. We asked Cecala, why does Posey believe that a plan that loses its grandfathered status is equivalent to Americans losing their current plan? "It is a different version of what you were having before," Cecala said. If an employer can't afford the new option, then the employer might drop the plan entirely or switch to a different plan, he said. Our ruling On the first half of Posey's claim, we agree that "before this law was passed, Americans were told they could keep their current health care plans." But the second half of his claim, that "After it became law the administration issued regulations stating nearly half of Americans would lose their current plan," is not so simple. Posey's math is correct when he points to the government estimates of employer plans that will lose grandfathered status. But telling the public that "half of Americans would lose their current plan" implies that they will be forced into a different provider's plan, a substantially worse plan or even no plan at all. By that definition, some Americans "lost" their current plans routinely for years before the health care law was signed. For those omissions, we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-14518	"Two-thirds of our kids can’t read at grade level."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/18/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-two-thirds-us-kids-cant-read-grad/	Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio pulled out a stunning statistic about the current state of K-12 education while making the case for school choice. "Two-thirds of our kids can’t read at grade level," Rubio wrote in a recent Medium post. We wondered whether the situation in American schools was really that bad, so we took a closer look. Rubio’s source was the National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP, a closely watched, federally sponsored standardized-testing effort. The most recent NAEP data for fourth- and eighth-grade students covers 2015. It offers four categories of achievement. From lowest to highest, they are "below basic," "basic," "proficient," and "advanced." The two most relevant categories for this fact-check are basic and proficient, and neither level’s definition mentions reading on grade level. Basic is defined as "denoting partial mastery of prerequisite knowledge and skills that are fundamental for proficient work at each grade assessed. Proficient is defined as "representing solid academic performance for each grade assessed" and "competency over challenging subject matter, including subject-matter knowledge, application of such knowledge to real-world situations, and analytical skills appropriate to the subject matter." Rubio is using the proficient level as his benchmark, and the picture that produces isn’t pretty. In 2015, just 36 percent of American fourth graders were categorized as either proficient or advanced in reading. Here’s the chart: And that same year, just 34 percent of eighth graders rated as either proficient or advanced in reading. Here’s the chart: Using that metric, Rubio supports his point. But education experts advised caution. Most important is that it’s a bit of a stretch for Rubio to equate a NAEP rating of "proficient" with being "at grade level." "There is no commonly accepted definition for what ‘grade level’ performance is or should be," said Christopher B. Swanson, vice president of Editorial Projects in Education, which publishes Education Week. NAEP, he said, is developed independently of the knowledge required by any specific state, district or school. David Bills, a professor of education at the University of Iowa, agreed. "As far as I know, no one has ever tested those labels against what kids actually need to know to do well in school," Bills said. Indeed, after the No Child Left Behind education law was enacted under President George W. Bush, "each state had to choose a level of ‘proficiency,’ and on average, this came closer to the NAEP basic level," said Eric Hanushek, a senior fellow in education policy at the conservative Hoover Institution. If this is the case, then one could instead use the "basic" level under NAEP and find that the success rates are 69 percent and 76 percent for fourth and eighth graders, respectively. Still, despite such words of caution, experts said Rubio’s decision to use the "proficient" level as his benchmark was defensible. Experts also ratified Rubio’s use of the NAEP tests as his data source. "Sure, there are lots of problems and it’s not a perfect measure, but that doesn’t mean it’s meaningless in all contexts," said Patricia M. Cooper, an associate professor and program coordinator for early childhood education at Queens College-City University of New York. There aren’t many credible alternatives to the NAEP numbers, she said. Cooper added that even the best-case scenario isn’t that great. "Even if Rubio’s off by half, that means one-third of our kids aren’t reading on grade level," she said. "Would that make us feel better?" Our ruling Rubio said that "two-thirds of our kids can’t read at grade level." The numbers from the NAEP reading test for fourth and eighth graders provide some support for his statement. However, experts said that there is no accepted definition of what being at "grade level" means under the NAEP tests. While Rubio's use of NAEP's higher "proficient" standard is a reasonable choice, experts said, it's not the only one -- many states have set standards aligned with NAEP's "basic" level instead. We rate the statement Half True.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2016-02-18T17:02:20	2016-01-26	['None']
pomt-10640	"There's not a major bill I know with Hillary's name on it."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/07/joe-biden/clintons-work-has-been-low-profile/	Before he bowed out of the race, Sen. Joe Biden dismissed the legislative accomplishments of three Democratic primary rivals with whom he served. Biden was particularly direct summing up Clinton's tenure, saying, "There's not a major bill I know with Hillary's name on it." In some ways, Biden's assessment is correct: Clinton has not been the lead sponsor of legislation dealing with a major national issue that made its way to President Bush's desk. But New York's junior senator has had comparatively few opportunities after spending four of her seven years in the chamber as a member of the minority. Instead, she has worked the way many senators do, introducing bills that wind up getting included in another's initiative, drafting a Senate companion bill to a popular House initiative or working with home state Republicans to send money to New York or protect local interests. After eight years as first lady, Clinton deliberately sought a lower profile in the Senate, respecting the seniority system and tending to steer away from contentious national debates such as health care. She also has adopted moderate — some would say carefully calibrated — rhetoric on abortion, the war in Iraq, fiscal policy and social issues. The approach surprised many of her critics, who suspected she would stake out more liberal positions and primarily use New York and the Senate as a stepping stone for her national ambitions. She was the leading Democratic sponsor of a 2003 law that gave the Food and Drug Administration the power to order drug companies to test their drugs to determine the proper dosages for children. The effort was inspired by cases in which children died or were injured taking drugs or using medical devices shown safe for adults. She worked with South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham in 2006 to get portions of legislation she authored to extend health coverage to National Guard troops and reservists included in a fiscal 2007 defense authorization bill. After the Sept. 11 attacks, Clinton authored a companion bill to House legislation ensuring that public safety officers killed or injured in the line of duty during the attacks would receive expedited payment of benefits. On another matter closely related to her home state, Clinton worked with Republican congressman Tom Reynolds to keep the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station open at a time when the Pentagon was closing bases — a move that saved 800 jobs. Clinton has effectively used her senatorial power to influence a handful of issues and to focus on local politics. Biden is correct when he says her name is not on a major bill, but as Biden knows better than most, that's not a fair measure of a legislator's accomplishments. We rule his statement Mostly True.

pomt-13265	"After how hard you work and how much you pay in taxes, New York City ends up getting the money. I'm Chris Jacobs. I think it's time we have someone in Albany that's making sure our region gets our fair share"	false	/new-york/statements/2016/oct/14/chris-jacobs/state-spends-more-western-new-york-it-receives-tax/	It’s not a new tactic for upstate Republicans running for state office: link rival Democrats to New York City, where more than half of state lawmakers come from, and promise to stand against that big liberal base. Republican Christopher L. Jacobs is following a similar tack in his Senate race in Buffalo. In an ad released in September, Jacobs says Buffalo does not receive its fair share from the state. "After how hard you work and how much you pay in taxes, New York City ends up getting the money," Jacobs says. "I'm Chris Jacobs. I think it's time we have someone in Albany that's making sure our region gets our fair share." Jacobs, the current Erie County Clerk, seeks to replace outgoing State Sen. Marc C. Panepinto. Panepinto, a Democrat who has held the seat since 2014, decided not to seek re-election. Jacobs is running against Democrat Amber Small, the executive director of the Parkside Community Association. Is Jacobs right? Does Western New York not get its fair share from the state? Where your money goes A 2011 report from the Rockefeller Institute found downstate New York typically pays more to the state in taxes than it gets back. Jacobs implies Western New York pays more to the state than it gets back. Data from the state Department of Budget shows otherwise. In total taxes collected by the state, 4.1 percent comes from the Western New York counties of Erie, Niagara, Chautauqua, Cattaraugus and Allegany. Three percent comes from Erie County. And 56 percent of the state’s tax collection comes from New York City. The State Legislature passed a $147.8 billion budget in April. The Department of Budget estimates $96.2 billion of that is state spending. The state said it could not break out total spending by region. But it did provide data showing the state receives less in taxes from Western New York than it spends in the region in major spending categories like education, economic development, roads and human services. Economic development The Department of Budget says $5.6 billion of the state’s economic development spending went to Western New York between 2012 and 2016. That’s 10.4 percent of the spending in that category statewide. It includes funds meant to boost the economy broadly through recreation, hospital capital and more. It also includes spending on job creation and business incentive programs like the Buffalo Billion. When looking at economic programs like those alone, Western New York received about 25 percent of the state’s spending over that time. Roads and bridges State infrastructure funds are also included under the economic development category. From 2012 to 2016, the state spent $1.6 billion on the region’s infrastructure. That’s another category in which Western New York received a bigger share of the money than the 4.1 percent it contributed in taxes. The state spent 9.7 percent of its road and bridge money in the region. Education aid The same is true for education aid, one of the largest spending categories. • Western New York received 9.1 percent of the state’s school aid in the most recent budget. That came to about $2.2 billion, the state says. • Erie County received 5.5 percent. • New York City received 39.9 percent. The state puts a cap on property tax increases. New York City does not have such a cap. State foundation aid to school districts is based on a formula from the State Education Department. It’s another source of revenue. Districts receive other state funds, like reimbursement for construction or BOCES funding, but foundation aid is the largest source of funding from the state for a district. More foundation aid was spent on students in Buffalo than New York City last school year. Buffalo Public Schools received close to $465 million in foundation aid during the last school year. With some 32,165 students, according to the department, that averages out to $14,450 per student. New York City’s schools, attended by slightly more than 1 million students, received almost $6.8 billion in the foundation aid. That averages out to $6,500 per student. Human services Western New York also gets a disproportionate share in human services spending, which includes child welfare, food stamps, foster care and more. New York City also receives more than it puts in for these services. • Western New York received 6.8 percent of human services spending in the last budget. That’s about $979 million, according to the state. • Erie County received 4.6 percent. • New York City received 59.1 percent of the human services spending, a percentage that is slightly more than its percentage contribution to the state’s tax receipts. Medicaid Western New York and Erie County hold almost even in Medicaid spending. • Western New York received 4.5 percent of Medicaid spending. • Erie County received 3.1 percent. • This is another spending category in which New York City receives a bigger percentage than its percentage contribution in taxes. New York City received 58.4 percent of Medicaid state spending. What’s he talking about? Jacobs’s campaign says his ad refers to local issues like education funding and the cost of electricity. Data shows he’s wrong on education aid. His claim on electricity refers to the Niagara Power Plant. "New York State has literally taken billions of dollars over the decades out of that plant to subsidize the other power plants that lose money and worse yet, billions have been dumped into New York State’s general fund budget," Jacobs said. The New York Power Authority confirms the Niagara plant ranks as the most lucrative among its 16 generating facilities. A certain amount is earmarked for Western New York, and any surplus power is sold on the open market. The power authority says its other facilities have not relied on revenue from the Niagara Power Plant. But how the power agency chooses to use the revenue is besides the point in the context of upstate versus New York City. The power plant is a state facility - not a regional one. "While the Niagara project is a cornerstone for the Western New York economy, it is a statewide asset," said Paul DeMichele of the authority. Our Ruling In his ad, Jacobs says "New York City ends up getting the money" from taxes paid by Western New York residents. Data obtained from the Department of Budget shows Western New York, including Erie County, consistently receives a bigger percentage share of state spending than its residents’ percentage contribution in taxes.

pomt-07050	Says President Obama "has fired more cruise missiles than all other Peace Prize winners combined."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/30/yard-sign/yard-sign-claims-barack-obama-has-fired-more-cruis/	The decision by the Norwegian Nobel Committee to award the Nobel Peace Prize to Barack Obama in 2009, the first year of his presidency, has long rankled his opponents, who felt he was inexperienced and hadn't earned the prestigious award. And even many of Obama’s supporters were disappointed by his decisions to continue the U.S. role in Iraq and send more troops to Afghanistan. So when Obama in March 2011 decided to enforce a "no-fly zone" to prevent Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi from crushing rebel forces, criticism flared. One of the most cutting lines, which ricocheted around blogs and even appeared on bumper stickers from a Libertarian website, stated: "Obama’s fired more cruise missiles than all other Nobel peace prize winners combined." A version of that slogan was put on a sign (with "missles" misspelled) along Route 12 near Keene, N.H., by Mark Edgington, a libertarian talk-radio host whose program, Free Talk Live, is heard on about 100 stations around the country. Edgington said he believes the sign is true because of what he's read on the Internet -- plus the fact that cruise missiles were not so available when other wartime leaders won Nobel peace prizes. "They didn’t have cruise missiles around then, so I felt relatively confident that it was true," said Edgington, who said his concern was also directly tied to Obama’s decision to intervene in Libya without seeking congressional authorization. "I find the actions to be unconstitutional. And I still think there is a greater message: he’s an awfully big killer to have received the Peace Prize, and I would have said the same thing about (former President George W.) Bush," he told PolitiFact. But is Barack Obama really a warmonger? And does the Dalai Lama (winner, 1989) know about this? First, a crash course in cruise missiles. They include everything from the short-range Chinese Eagle Strike missile to the U.S. Tomahawk Land Attack missile, which has a range of 1,500 miles. The Federation of American Scientists, an independent Washington-based group created in 1945 to analyze national security issues related to science and technology, defines cruise missiles as "an unmanned self-propelled guided vehicle that sustains flight through aerodynamic lift for most of its flight path and whose primary mission is to place an ordnance or special payload on a target." More simply put, cruise missiles, often fired from sea or air, are jet-propelled, as opposed to rocket-propelled missiles. Rather than the arc of a rocket, they fly more like a plane to avoid radar. At least 12 exporting countries -- Great Britain, the United States, China, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and Taiwan -- have developed them, according to the FAS website, and dozens of other countries have some variant in their arsenals. They aren’t cheap, either -- Tomahawks now cost about $1.1 million apiece, the Navy said recently. Cruise missiles can trace their antecedents to the infamous German V-1, or "buzz bomb," of World War II. And some countries have had short-range, anti-ship cruise missiles for years. John Pike, the director of GlobalSecurity.org, a Washington-based website of military information, said the U.S. relied on them as part of its nuclear arsenal for most of the Cold War and then began to deploy them as conventional weapons. Pike said current-day cruise missiles’ major debut came in 1991 during the Gulf War under President George H.W. Bush. That campaign saw almost 300 Tomahawk cruise missiles fired. An elite group Given the limited time frame that cruise missiles have been used, the number of Nobel laureates who could have fired them is limited. For starters, Nobel laureates such as the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (1997), Burmese human rights activist Aung San Suu Kyi (1991) and Doctors Without Borders (1999) aren’t going to be firing cruise missiles -- ever. Similarly, while the United States fired them in Serbia as part of a NATO air campaign, they can’t be attributed to 1991 Nobel laureate Kofi Annan, the secretary-general of the United Nations, which had peacekeeping troops in the Balkans. And former President Jimmy Carter, who won the prize in 2002, was not directly involved in any major hostilities while in office, outside of trying to rescue the American Embassy hostages in Iran. Mikhail Gorbachev (Nobel, 1990) was known for helping to end the Cold War and reducing the nuclear arsenal, but did preside over the Soviet Union during its final years in its invasion of Afghanistan. Pike noted that western accounts of the Soviet war in Afghanistan are "necessarily incomplete," but says he "cannot imagine what type of cruise missile they would have used" there. And while the Israelis have also developed cruise missiles over the years, some reportedly for nuclear purposes, they have held them largely in check. Accounts of the 1973 Yom Kippur War indicate that the Egyptians used about two dozen short-range Soviet-made anti-ship cruise missiles against the Israelis, which would implicate then-Egyptian President Anwar Sadat (who won the Nobel along with Israel’s Menachem Begin in 1978). And the Israelis reportedly fired anti-ship Gabriel missiles at Egyptian and Syrian targets, sinking 10 of their boats. But even if these were to be considered true cruise missiles, future Israeli prime ministers Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, who shared the prize with Yasser Arafat in 1994, were not in power at the time, nor was Begin. And the numbers fall short of U.S. salvos. The Obama Tally So is Obama a cruise-missile-firing standout among Nobel laureates? He has fired at least 192, according to the Pentagon’s March 28 briefing about Libya, and is the fourth American president in a row to launch them. But he's the only president in that group to win the peace prize. Vice President Al Gore, who went on to win his Nobel in 2007 for his work on global warming, supported the American use of cruise missiles in the 1999 NATO effort to protect Kosovo. And, in fact, as president, Bill Clinton deployed Tomahawks repeatedly, sending well over 600 cruise missiles during his administration at targets in Iraq, Serbia, Sudan and Afghanistan. But, Clinton was commander in chief, not Gore. It’s also worth noting that the 1973 Nobel Peace Prize winner, former Secretary of State and National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger, has been linked to the secret bombing of Cambodia during the Vietnam War. But he and Richard Nixon used bombers, not nuclear-tipped cruise missiles, for that campaign. Experts said they believe the sign's claim about Obama and cruise missiles appears technically true, but also merits some context. George R. Lucas Jr., the chairman in ethics at the Stockdale Center for Ethical Leadership at the U.S. Naval Academy and a professor of ethics and public policy at the Naval Postgraduate School, said by e-mail that the statement was probably "true by definition" and undoubtedly "deliberately ironic" to score a point. "My own sense is that this president (has) behaved very responsibly with the use of military force, but that, like all recent presidents, he has faced circumstances that are profoundly complex, and in which the decisions to use force are open to question and criticism," Lucas wrote. For his part, Obama, in a March 28, 2011, speech, defended the Libyan strikes, saying they were for a humanitarian purpose, intended to save the city of Benghazi "and the people within." Based on our review of historical records and interviews with military historians, it appears the sign along the New Hampshire highway is correct. The next closest contender was Sadat during the Yom Kippur war, but it appears he was far short of the number fired by Obama, even in combination with other laureates. If we hear of additional evidence, we'll revisit this item. But in the meantime, the numbers indicate the sign is correct. We rate the statement True.

pomt-09163	"Our school test scores are right at the bottom."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2010/jun/08/thurbert-baker/baker-says-test-scores-show-georgia-failing-studen/	When you're a candidate for governor from a party out of power, you look for the ruling party's weak spots. So when Democrat Thurbert Baker recently made his kickoff speech for his run for governor, he mentioned a litany of problems in the state, including Georgia's low educational ranking. "Now, we may be No. 1 in bank failures, but our school test scores are right at the bottom," Baker said. "This isn't the fault of our teachers or our students. It's the fault of our leaders who talk a good game about education but do nothing. In fact, they do worse than nothing. Whenever the politicians go looking for money to fund their pet projects, guess where they get it? They cut education!" In his speech, the outgoing attorney general gave us plenty of red meat to chew on. We decided to take a look into his claim about school test scores. Is Georgia "right at the bottom"? Baker campaign official Edward Chapman was happy to tell us where his boss came up with that statement: an Atlanta Journal-Constitution article last year reporting how Georgia's students fared on the SAT. "Georgia finished ahead of only South Carolina, Hawaii, Maine and the District of Columbia," the Aug. 30, 2009, article reported. (That may not be something to boast about, but Georgia's students ranked last in the nation in 2004, so they've improved.) So, with the caveat that educators often warn against state comparisons because of wide variations in the types of students who take the tests, yes, the SAT alone indicates Georgia is close to the bottom. But we decided to look at scores on another college admission test -- the ACT. (There's a caveat with this one, too, because a smaller percentage of Georgia students take it than in many other states.) Georgia fared better here. It ranked ahead of 10 states and the District of Columbia in the average ACT composite score. Another element of the ACT measures the percentage of students who passed its benchmark scores in English, math, reading and science. On this one, Georgia finished 38th, ahead of 13 others states, and just below students in the District of Columbia. Baker campaign officials still contend their candidate's statement is true because more Georgia students take the SAT as opposed to the ACT. "We have always been at or very near the bottom among the states," Chapman said. So overall, Georgia's test scores on the two main college entrance exams paint different pictures. On the SAT, the state ranked 47th. But on the ACT, the state was 38th or 40th. So it's not, as Baker said, "right at the bottom." We find his claim Half True.

pomt-11215	"Eric Schneiderman helped NXIVM sell child sex slaves to the Clintons"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/may/10/ny-evening-news/no-eric-schneiderman-didnt-sell-child-sex-slaves-c/	After New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman stepped down amid allegations that he abused women, a story without any evidence circulated on Facebook that he covered up a sex cult. "Eric Schneiderman helped NXIVM sell child sex slaves to the Clintons," said a May 9 headline by the NY Evening News, a website that has sections on conspiracies and UFOs. The story attributed the information to Your News Wire, which frequently posts fake news. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The story smashes together an actual federal criminal case against organizers of a sex cult to falsely allege that it involves Schneiderman selling children to the Clintons. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Schneiderman resigned May 7 following a report by The New Yorker that four women accused him of physical assault. He denied the allegations. The NY Evening News story said, "Schneiderman used his position as Attorney General to cover-up the crimes of NXIVM – a cult recently exposed as selling child sex slaves to the Clintons." The criminal case about the sex cult NXIVM (pronounced Nex-e-um) is real, although the NY Evening News story makes up details. We previously rated a claim that defendant Allison Mack, an actress on the TV show Smallville, sold sex slaves to the Clintons as Pants on Fire. Mack and co-defendant Keith Raniere face real federal charges for sex trafficking, sex trafficking conspiracy and forced labor conspiracy. Both have pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors said that Mack recruited women to join what was portrayed as a female mentorship group that was led by Raniere. The victims were then exploited, including sexually. We searched news accounts for connections between Schneiderman’s office and the case. In March, Schneiderman’s office filed a court case asking a judge to order Brandon B. Porter, a medical doctor who conducted controversial research on behalf of NXIVM, to turn over records related to studies. The case also asked Clare F. Bronfman, heiress to Seagram and NXIVM operations director, to turn over records. But Schneiderman’s office suspended the state investigation after the March 25 arrest of Raniere on federal charges. A 2017 story by the Albany Times-Union said that law enforcement had fielded complaints about NXIVM for years and that Schneiderman’s office had begun to examine dealings. "The new interest comes after multiple law enforcement agencies, including Schneiderman's office, had for years brushed aside the concerns from Raniere's critics and others about the murky inner workings of NXIVM, which one expert has characterized as an 'extreme cult,' " the Times-Union wrote. We read federal court records and news articles about the case and found no evidence that Schneiderman helped "NXIVM sell child sex slaves to the Clintons."

pomt-01858	"This president has offered fewer executive actions than almost any other president preceding his presidency in recent history."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/13/beto-orourke/texas-democrat-obama-offered-fewer-executive-actio/	Lately, President Barack Obama has emphasized his willingness to take as much action as he can without congressional approval, much to Republicans’ chagrin. For example, at the end of June, Obama announced that he would do as much as he could by himself to address immigration reform -- an issue magnified by the recent influx of an estimated 52,000 undocumented child immigrants from Central America. He painted House Republicans as unwilling to move forward with critical legislation. "I take executive action only when we have a serious problem, a serious issue, and Congress chooses to do nothing," he said. "America cannot wait forever for them to act. And that's why today, I'm beginning a new effort to fix as much of our immigration system as I can on my own, without Congress." Republicans are saying his actions are brash and unconstitutional. Some, like former vice presidential candidate and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, say it’s grounds for impeachment. The topic came up on the Sunday talk shows amid discussion of immigration legislation and House Speaker John Boehner’s plan to sue Obama over his decision to delay the Affordable Care Act’s employer mandate. On CNN’s State of the Union, Rep. Beto O’Rourke, D-Texas, stood up for Obama and his use of presidential power. "This president has offered fewer executive actions than almost any other president preceding his presidency in recent history," said Beto, who is from El Paso. We decided to check it out. Obama’s place in executive order history Earlier this year, we looked into how many executive orders Obama had signed compared to previous presidents. Executive orders are official actions taken by the president directing the federal government and bureaucracies. They carry the power of law, but can be revoked or amended by future administrations and are limited in scope. For example, Obama cannot use executive orders to raise the minimum wage for the entire country, but he did use an executive order recently to raise the minimum wage for workers hired under new federal contracts to $10.10 an hour. The use of executive orders picked up under Ulysses S. Grant, who issued 217 executive orders, nearly 140 more than his predecessor Andrew Johnson, who himself almost doubled Abraham Lincoln, the previous record holder. The current record holder is Franklin Roosevelt, who issued 3,522 executive orders throughout his time in office. Here’s what we found for the past 10 presidents, according to the American Presidency Project at the University of California Santa Barbara: President Number of executive orders Obama 182 George W. Bush 291 Bill Clinton 364 George H. W. Bush 166 Ronald Reagan 381 Jimmy Carter 320 Gerald Ford 169 Richard Nixon 346 Lyndon Johnson 325 John F. Kennedy 214 So in the past 50 years, Obama has so far signed fewer executive orders than every other president except two -- Gerald Ford (who finished Richard Nixon’s second term) and George H. W. Bush (who served one term). And he’s signed fewer per day than every president back to Grover Cleveland, according to research by the Brookings Institution. But O’Rourke said ‘actions’ O’Rourke is on solid ground had he said "executive orders." But he said "executive actions." That’s a different and tougher to prove statistic. Executive action is a hard-to-define and broad category that encompasses any unilateral presidential action -- including the executive orders listed above, pardoning criminals, amending the internal structure of the executive branch, issuing signing statements, writing letters and memoranda, and more. The White House recently released a document touting 45 solo actions Obama has taken this year alone. The list includes his executive order to raise the minimum wage for federal employees. It also talks about his recently unveiled Environmental Protection Agency plan to reduce carbon emissions by 30 percent, which is not an executive order. And there are smaller measures, like creating working groups and encouraging local leaders to commit to end veteran homelessness. John Woolley, a political science professor at University of California Santa Barbara, outlined three types of executive actions: Officially enumerated orders and proclamations; Presidential orders conveyed in writing in forms other than executive orders and proclamations; Discretionary actions by executive agencies that a president encourages or tolerates and could stop or reverse. Woolley noted, though, that while the federal register catalogs executive orders, there is not a consolidated tally of all executive actions. This makes comparing Obama’s use of unilateral action to other presidents’ difficult, said Kenneth Mayer, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. "There is no single metric you can point to and say, ‘This president has executed more unilateral actions than other presidents,’ " Mayer said. Additionally, some scholars and politicians might disagree on what counts as unilateral presidential action and how important that particular action is, he added. But based on his research, Mayer said Obama has done nothing exceptional in terms of unilateral actions, compared to other presidents. Similar criticisms have been thrown at presidents from the opposing party for centuries, starting with George Washington’s decision to proclaim neutrality in the war between England and France. But unless agencies or scholars start to tally and examine all executive actions, not just orders, it may be impossible to quantify a president’s use of unilateral power. "People who say Obama has issued fewer (or certainly no more) executive orders than his immediate predecessors are correct," Woolley said. "However, the claim that he has directed fewer executive branch discretionary actions is far less certain. For the record, O’Rourke’s office provided us evidence about executive orders, not executive actions. Our ruling O’Rourke said, "This president has offered fewer executive actions than almost any other president preceding his presidency in recent history." People often point to the number of a president’s executive orders to indicate his use of unilateral action, and by that metric, Obama has a lower record than most presidents in recent history. That’s likely what O’Rourke meant when he said "executive action." But executive action includes much more than just orders, and there’s no way to definitively calculate how many Obama has carried out in order to compare him to other presidents. O’Rourke is right when it comes to one type of executive action -- executive orders -- but the rest of the record is unclear. As such, we rate, we rate O’Rourke’s statement Half True.

pomt-03949	"Every dollar we invested in high-quality, early education programs can save more than $7 later on by boosting graduation rates, reducing teen pregnancy, even reducing crime."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/feb/19/barack-obama/does-obama-get-education-claim/	President Barack Obama called on Congress to expand access to early childhood education in his State of the Union address. "Every dollar we invest in high-quality early childhood education can save more than $7 later on – by boosting graduation rates, reducing teen pregnancy, even reducing violent crime," Obama said. Obama name-dropped Georgia and Oklahoma as states that have prioritized early education, and traveled to an early childhood education program in Decatur to reinforce his point. The president used nearly the same language about the economic benefits of early education in his speech at the College Heights Early Childhood Learning Center in Decatur and posted the claim on his Twitter account. We wanted to know whether "high-quality" pre-school really provides states about $7 in bang for their buck and whether Obama’s right about the other aspects of these programs. Obama is touting a number familiar in the debate on Head Start, the federal program created by President Lyndon Johnson in 1965 that aims to prepare children from birth to age 5 from low-income families for school. Services for enrolled children and their families include health, nutrition, social services and education. Others have questioned efforts by Georgia and other states to implement universal preschool for 4-year-olds, citing the cost and its results. A White House official referred us to a recent report on a prominent long-term study aimed at determining whether early education programs can have a positive impact on a child’s future. A White House fact sheet says Obama plans to expand the federal government’s Early Head Start program, which serves children from birth to age 3. First, let’s look at whether the president’s math is correct. In the early 1960s, a team of researchers started what’s known as the HighScope Perry Preschool Program. The study targeted 123 economically disadvantaged, at-risk African-American children in a small town called Ypsilanti, Mich., which is about 30 miles from Detroit. Fifty-eight of them were randomly selected to participate in a program to which they had access to early care education; the rest received no preschool program. The 123 students were tracked over various stages of their childhood and at the ages of 19 and 27. Obama’s press team pointed us to a University of Chicago’s report that analyzed the benefit-cost ratio for the Perry program in the footsteps of other studies. The paper said "each dollar invested returns in present value terms 7 to 12 dollars back to society." A 1999 report by the Libertarian Cato Institute concluded there’s scant empirical evidence to back up the claim that there is a $7 return for each dollar invested in these programs. Our friends at PolitiFact Ohio explored a similar claim about the economic effectiveness of Head Start in 2011. Their fact check focused on a 2007 study on Head Start by Jens Ludwig, a University of Chicago professor, and Deborah A. Phillips of Georgetown University. PolitiFact Ohio rated the claim Mostly True. W. Steven Barnett, a co-director of the National Institute for Early Education Research at Rutgers University, wrote a commentary where he included a benefit-cost analysis using data from three programs similar to Head Start (including Perry). The estimated return for Perry was 16.1 to 1. Now, let’s examine whether Obama has a point about the impact of early education on graduation rates, teen pregnancy and crime. The students who had access to the early education program in Michigan were more likely to graduate from high school and earn higher salaries, and less likely to be arrested, Perry researchers concluded. One of the University of Chicago researchers also told us that they found girls who enrolled in the early care program were half as likely to be pregnant as teenagers compared with those who did not enroll in the program. Some researchers are less impressed by the Perry program, saying the sample of students studied was too small and it was designed to help enrollees do well. The author of the 1999 Cato study cites other research that says students who enrolled in the Perry program dropped out of school at higher rates than students who were not considered at-risk and that there is no consensus on what components of the program were responsible for the children's gains. Regarding Head Start, some researchers found children who experienced Head Start were more likely to finish high school and have better jobs with greater earning power, and less likely to commit crime when they grew up. They also thought an emphasis on medical screenings and preventive care reduced Medicaid expenses. Head Start critics say the program is inefficient and wasteful. Some point to a 2010 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services study of Head Start that showed few advantages by the end of the third grade for students who entered the program as 3-year-olds as opposed to children who enrolled in Head Start at the age of 4. Since Obama mentioned the programs in Georgia and Oklahoma, we thought we should see what has been the extended impact of them in those states. A 2009 study of Georgia’s pre-k program concluded it was a positive learning environment, but "leaders may want to consider increasing time spent on literacy and math while continuing to ensure that children engage in a broad array of activities." Oklahoma news outlets have reported that fourth grade math and reading scores have declined in the past decade since that state was declared a leader in early education. Our ruling The president says every dollar the federal government invests in high-quality early education programs can save more than $7 later on by boosting graduation rates, reducing teen pregnancy and crime. Obama’s figure is widely shared and based on academic reports that have tried to determine the cost of Head Start and the Perry program. Whether these programs are "high-quality" is a more difficult discussion. There is debate about the long-term effectiveness of the Perry program and of Head Start because there are so many factors involved in a child’s development after the child leaves these programs. Additionally, there’s little research on the long-term impact of these programs in Georgia and Oklahoma, so the president’s remarks seem to be a stretch at this point. The president’s statement is partially true but needs an awful lot of context to be fully understood. We rate Obama’s claim Half True.

pomt-07003	"Fifty-one percent -- that is, a majority of American households -- paid no income tax in 2009. Zero. Zip. Nada."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/08/john-cornyn/john-cornyn-says-51-percent-american-households-pa/	In a July 7, 2011, floor speech, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, offered a striking statistic about how few American households pay federal income taxes. "Let's talk about federal tax reform," he said, referring to suggestions that a restructuring of the tax code could emerge from bipartisan negotiations over extending the federal government’s ability to borrow money. "There has been a lot of discussion about that, where we want to take the tax code with all of its multiple provisions and get it on the table and take a look at it to make sure it is, in my view, flatter, fairer and simpler. "But right now, the fact (is) that according to the Committee on Joint Taxation, 51 percent -- that is, a majority of American households -- paid no income tax in 2009. Zero. Zip. Nada. … Actually, to show how out of whack things have gotten, 30 percent of American households actually made money from the tax system by way of refundable tax credits -- the Earned Income Tax Credit, among others. So 51 percent of American households paid no income tax in 2009, but 30 percent actually made money under the current system." In a sign that this is becoming a Republican talking point, Cornyn’s comments echoed those made on the floor the same day by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. So, is it true that a majority of Americans aren’t paying any federal income tax? The answer is that Cornyn is correct. And the backstory is interesting. As Cornyn noted, his statistics come from a document produced by the Joint Committee on Taxation, a respected bipartisan committee of Congress. The JCT found that for tax year 2009, roughly 22 percent of "tax units" (not exactly "households," but we’ll give Cornyn a pass on the terminology) ended up without any tax liability. Another 30 percent got money back from the government, through mechanisms such as the Earned Income Tax Credit, a longstanding policy that encourages low-income Americans to work by refunding money through the tax code. By contrast, JCT found just 49 percent of Americans owed anything to the government. How did we get to the point where most Americans don’t pay federal income taxes? Our colleagues at PolitiFact Virginia explained it a few months ago while checking a similar claim by House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va. The main reason is that the U.S. employs the tax system not just to collect funds but to distribute them as well. Bob Williams, a tax policy specialist at the nonpartisan Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, said this is largely carried out through popular tax breaks, which are sometimes called "tax expenditures." "There are lots and lots of them," he said. "We estimate they total more than a trillion dollars a year in reduced taxes, and in fact the bulk of those go to the top end of the income distribution." However, because high earners have so much income liability, the breaks they get still don’t lower their taxes to zero. By contrast, popular lower- and middle-income breaks such as child credits and mortgage interest deductions do get a big share of the population off the hook. Concern about the wisdom of providing so many tax expenditures is one of the reasons why some are calling for fundamentally restructuring the tax code, perhaps as part of the ongoing debt ceiling negotiations. A tax code that included fewer specialized exemptions and deductions would enable basic tax rates to fall for all tax brackets. As an added benefit, the tax code would become simpler. We should note that Cornyn worded his statement carefully enough to avoid potential pitfalls. Here are a few of them: Cornyn made clear that he meant 2009. The percentage of households with no tax liability bounces around quite a bit year by year, partly due to changes in the tax code and partly due to changing economic conditions. Figures from the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center show that since 2004, the percentage of no-liability tax units has been as low as 39.9 percent in 2007. In fact, 2009 -- the year Cornyn cited -- may prove to be a high point. The center’s projections suggest that the rate could fall to 49.5 percent for tax year 2010 and 46.4 percent in 2011. Cornyn took care to refer to households that pay no "income tax," rather than suggesting that they paid no taxes at all. Many Americans who pay no income tax pay other federal taxes, most notably the payroll tax, which funds Social Security and Medicare and is deducted from every working American’s paycheck. Estimates by the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center project that for tax year 2011, 46.4 percent of households won’t have any income tax liability. However, of this number, 28.3 percent will pay payroll taxes, the center projects. Of the remaining 18.1 percent with neither income nor payroll tax liability, 10.3 percent are elderly and 6.9 percent are not elderly but have incomes lower than $20,000. In other words, all but a tiny sliver of Americans without either income tax or payroll tax liability are either elderly or poor. Some families who pay no federal income tax may be liable for state income taxes (and local property taxes, sales taxes and the like). But Cornyn began his remarks by talking about "federal tax reform," so we won't fault him for not mentioning that. There are enough different ways to look at the tax burden to allow all sides to pick and choose tax statistics that favor their positions. Conservatives have a point that richer Americans pay the lion’s share of federal taxes. In 2007, according to the Urban-Brookings Center, the richest 20 percent paid 68.9 percent of federal taxes, and the top 1 percent paid 28.1 percent. (One would expect the rich to pay more, since they earn more, but these percentages are even higher than their share of the nation's total income. According to one frequently cited academic study, the top 20 percent earned 61.4 percent of income in 2006 and the top 1 percent earned 21.3 percent of income that same year.) In addition, the richest 10 percent, 5 percent and 1 percent of taxpayers each paid significantly higher effective tax rates than Americans lower on the income spectrum. On the other hand, PolitiFact rated as Mostly True a recent statement by President Barack Obama that "if you're a … wealthy CEO or a … hedge fund manager in America right now, your taxes are … lower than they've been since the 1950s." And by international standards, the U.S. tax burden remains modest. In other words, scoring points on tax policy depends on how you frame the issue. So where does this leave us? A full understanding of U.S. tax policy requires a lot of additional context that Cornyn didn’t supply. Still, at PolitiFact, words matter, and on the specific point Cornyn was making -- that a majority of American households paid no income tax in 2009 -- he not only accurately cited a credible study but also took care to cite a specific year and to explain that he only meant to refer to federal income taxes. So we rate Cornyn’s statement True.	None	John Cornyn	None	None	None	2011-07-08T16:07:55	2011-07-07	['United_States']
pomt-03906	In annual surveys of Rhode Island communities that receive Drug Free community grants, many report that more than 50 percent of youth surveyed do not think daily marijuana use poses any serious risk of harm.	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/mar/01/nancy-devaney/chairwoman-ocean-state-prevention-alliance-says-ma/	As Rhode Island lawmakers debate proposals to legalize marijuana, health officials and others opposed to drug use are warning of serious consequences. Among their concerns is that efforts to legalize the drug may lead teenagers to believe there is no risk of serious harm in using it. Some national surveys say that marijuana use among young people has increased in recent years, after surveyed declines during the late 1990s and early 2000s. Nancy Devaney is chairwoman of the Ocean State Prevention Alliance, a Rhode Island organization that opposes marijuana legalization. In a Feb. 20 news release from the Alliance, this statement is attributed to her: "In annual surveys of Rhode Island communities that receive [federal] Drug Free community grants, many report that more than 50 percent of youth surveyed do not think daily marijuana use poses any serious risk of harm." PolitiFact Rhode Island contacted Devaney to ask about the claim. She e-mailed us numbers she said came from surveys conducted in five of the eight Rhode Island communities that make up the alliance, which works to pursue grants aimed at preventing and reducing drug use. Devaney said the communities conducted the surveys to fulfill requirements of federal grants they received. Devaney gave us survey numbers but not the survey questions and results, so we sought to verify them. We contacted officials from the communities involved and got results from six of the eight communities in the Prevention Alliance. Some of the communities surveyed middle school students and some didn’t, but all surveyed high school students, so we’ll focus on those results. When we looked at the numbers, things became a bit complicated because the communities asked the question and tabulated the results in different ways. Tiverton, Middletown and North Kingstown, for example, asked high school students whether daily use of marijuana posed risk of serious harm -- the way Devaney phrased her statement. But other communities asked variations of the question. For example, some asked whether smoking marijuana a few times a week -- not daily -- posed a serious risk. And when the responses were tabulated, some grouped results, combining "moderate" and "great risk." All of the survey results we reviewed, however, supported Devaney’s general point -- that a majority of young people didn’t believe that regular marijuana use was risky. PolitiFact Rhode Island also looked at national research. The survey Monitoring the Future, done yearly by University of Michigan researchers since the 1970s, asked more than 45,000 students in grades 8, 10 and 12 questions including about their perception of the risk of harmfulness of marijuana. Asked about people who smoke marijuana "regularly," according to Monitoring the Future, about 67 percent of eight graders said great risk. In the 2012 survey, about 51 percent of 10th graders said great risk of harm for people who smoke marijuana regularly and 44 percent of 12th graders said they perceive great risk of harm. By contrast, in the early 1990s, the percentages of 12th graders who saw great risk of harm for marijuana were in the high 70s. A survey released in September 2012 by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, said that nationally 44.8 percent of people ages 12 to 17 in 2011 perceived great risk in smoking marijuana once or twice per week. And less than 28 percent perceived great risk in smoking marijuana once a month. That survey said that in Rhode Island, from 2010 through 2011, an estimated 21.5 percent of people ages 12 to 17 perceived great risk for those who smoked marijuana once a month. In other words, the national surveys generally supported Devaney’s claim as well. Our ruling Nancy Devaney, chairwoman of Ocean State Prevention Alliance, said in a news release: "In annual surveys of RI communities that receive Drug Free community grants, many report that more than 50 percent of RI youth surveyed do not think daily marijuana use poses any serious risk of harm." The percentages from surveys in several communities we checked generally supported her statement, though not all students asked about their perceptions of risk based on daily use of the drug. For those reasons, we rate the statement Mostly True. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at politifact@providencejournal.com.

pomt-07585	Woonsocket needs a garbage-burning power plant because "residents are paying through the nose for electricity that’s fueled by foreign oil, at prices that are skyrocketing."	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2011/mar/27/jon-brien/rep-brien-says-woonsocket-needs-garbage-burning-po/	State Rep. Jon D. Brien, D-Woonsocket, has proposed legislation that would override Rhode Island’s 20-year ban on trash incinerators and permit Woonsocket to host a waste-to-energy plant. In a news release from the State House, and later at a hearing on Thursday before his House Committee on Municipal Government, Brien made two arguments. First, he said it makes no sense to continue dumping garbage at the Rhode Island Central Landfill, which the state has to continually expand, especially because the garbage could be transformed into a viable alternative energy resource. "Rather than burying trash in the ground and that being the end of it, why not use it to create electricity?" Brien said in an interview. That puzzled us, because the state’s Resource Recovery Corporation already generates electricity from garbage, collecting methane gas produced by the decomposing trash deep in the landfill and piping it to a commercial plant that burns the gas to produce power. But it was his second point -- that the waste-to-energy plant is needed because "residents are paying through the nose for electricity that’s fueled by foreign oil, at prices that are skyrocketing" -- that really jumped out at us. Power plants in Rhode Island converted long ago from burning oil to burning natural gas. Most new plants burn natural gas. The one big exception remains the Brayton Point power plant in Somerset that burns coal, and a little natural gas. So we wondered how the Woonsocket waste-to-energy plant that Brien supports would have any effect on our dependence on foreign oil. We contacted ISO New England, the independent, not-for-profit corporation that oversees the distribution of electricity throughout New England. Spokeswoman Ellen Foley directed us to a chart showing electric power energy sources in New England. The chart shows that natural gas accounted for 32 percent of the power generation in New England in 2010. Nuclear was the next biggest source, at 29 percent. Coal generated 11 percent of New England’s power. Hydropower generated another 5.5 percent. Renewable sources such as wind, solar, and landfill gases provide 6 percent. The power plants that can run on either oil or natural gas produced 12 percent of the region’s power. But ISO officials say they burn mostly gas, because oil is so expensive. In fact, it’s so expensive that the amount of power generated by oil, according to ISO, was only 0.4 percent. In other words, nearly zero. When we asked Brien about this discrepancy, he insisted that oil is used to generate electricity used locally. And with oil trading at a two-year high, he said it is possible that oil is affecting electricity prices. That is certainly true nationally, he said. No, it’s not. Nationally, oil produces less than one percent of the nation’s electricity, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Bottom line: an extremely small percentage of Rhode Island’s and New England’s electricity comes from high-priced foreign oil. One would expect a state representative who is pushing a power plant in his district to know that. We rule his statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-01793	Under President Ronald Reagan, illegal immigrants "were not pouring in like" they are now.	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/24/deirdre-imus/deirdre-imus-more-illegal-immigrants-pouring-now-u/	The crisis of young Central Americans showing up at the border has presented pundits another opportunity to compare the records of President Barack Obama and President Ronald Reagan. We caught Deidre Imus, a Fox Business contributor, debating presidential immigration scorecards with Fox News analyst Lis Wiehl on July 23, 2014. "What has happened under President (Barack) Obama, is people thinking they can come here, especially unaccompanied minors, thinking they are getting amnesty," Imus said on her husband Don’s show Imus in the Morning. Wiehl shot back that this had been going on a long time and in fact, it was no different under Reagan. Imus was nonplussed. Imus: "They were not pouring in like that, Lis. Are you really going to say that?" Wiehl: "Yes, they were. They were pouring in. Yes, they were." Imus: "No, they weren’t. No, they were not." A reader asked us to find out who was right. The weight of the evidence favors Wiehl, not Imus. Less people are illegally entering, or trying to illegally enter, the country under Obama than Reagan. There are two ways to measure the pressure at the border. You can look at total apprehensions by the U.S. Border Patrol and you can look at changes in the estimates of the undocumented population in the country. Neither is perfect, but apprehension numbers have the advantage that at least they are based on the actual reports of people detained by federal agents, rather than surveys by the Census Bureau. We’ll look at the apprehension data first. Apprehensions Using data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection we can see the number of people stopped along the southwest border. This table covers the number of attempted crossings during the Reagan years. Year Apprehensions 1988 942,861 1987 1,122,067 1986 1,615,844 1985 1,183,351 1984 1,058,276 1983 1,033,974 1982 745,820 1981 749,808 Average 1,056,500 And this one covers the same border for the Obama years. Year Apprehensions 2013 414,397 2012 356,873 2011 327,577 2010 447,731 2009 540,865 Average 417,489 It’s worth noting that apprehensions include everyone who is caught in the United States illegally. This would include the unaccompanied minors who have stirred such concern recently. We know the number of these young people has been rising rapidly and the data in this table only run through 2013. It’s fair to ask if the exponential growth among children would be enough to change the results of this comparison if we had a complete count for 2014. The answer is, not likely. In 2013, the unaccompanied children represented about 6 percent of the total. While they might be the focus of the current debate, even if they continue to grow dramatically, they have a limited impact on the overall numbers. There is another issue. Susan Martin, a migration policy expert at Georgetown University, cautions that border patrol tactics changed between the 1980s and today. "The basic strategy in the 1980s, and before, was to apprehend and then return people immediately back to Mexico," Martin said. "A substantial number attempted re-entry until they were successful. It was, in effect, a revolving door. Beginning in the Clinton administration, the strategy shifted to deterrence." For a while, that deterrence strategy, which included fingerprinting and a hardened border, tended to push the numbers down. For the purposes of this fact-check, the point is that changes in tactics and policies will change the apprehension statistics. With that caveat, there were far more apprehensions during the Reagan administration than during the Obama administration. Estimated undocumented population Measuring the number of undocumented people during most of the Reagan years is difficult. Before 1986, the Census Bureau made no allowance for people who were in the country without authorization. The bureau’s best estimate was that starting in 1980, about 200,000 undocumented people entered the country each year. In 1986, the Census Bureau began tracking these numbers, but much more significant than survey methods, 1986 brought a major immigration reform law that offered amnesty to people who had been in the country continuously since 1982. In short order, more than 1.5 million people applied for and gained legal status. The standard way to measure the flow of unauthorized people into the country is to see how that population changes from year to year. But with people converting from illegal to legal status, simple comparisons became tricky during the last two years of Reagan’s term. Jeffrey Passel is a senior demographer with the Pew Research Center and is a leading authority on immigration statistics. Allowing for the people who changed their status, Passel finds "a net increase of about 1.6 million" during the Reagan years. To put that in annual terms, while the flow might have gone up and down, the average rate of 200,000 per year held true throughout Reagan’s administration. For Obama, Passel said the numbers are "far less than under Reagan." Passel said there was a net increase of 370,000 undocumented people and the average annual change was 120,000 from 2009-12. Data from the Department of Homeland Security show an actual decline. The estimated undocumented population in 2010 was 11.6 million. For 2011, it was 11.5 million, and in 2012, it was 11.4 million. (We don’t include 2009 because of a major revision in Census Bureau methodology that prevents a direct comparison.) By definition, estimating is not an exact science and so Homeland Security summarized the trend as "little to no change." "It is unlikely that the unauthorized immigrant population increased after 2007," the department wrote in 2011, "given relatively high U.S. unemployment, improved economic conditions in Mexico, record low numbers of apprehensions of unauthorized immigrants at U.S. borders, and greater levels of border enforcement." Martin at Georgetown University underscored that much of the trend is due to basic economics. "Employer demand is certainly a major factor in explaining shifts in movement," Martin said. "When the economy tanked in 2008, particularly in sectors such as construction, the number of new arrivals plummeted to what is estimated to be net zero growth in undocumented migration." According to the Pew Research Center, the unauthorized immigrant population rose slightly in 2012 to 11.7 million. But that still leaves the Obama years with fewer new undocumented people than Reagan. Our ruling Imus said that people "were not pouring in" under Reagan like they are now. The numbers tell a different story. The apprehension figures, even allowing for changes in tactics, show an average of over a million attempts by people to cross the border during the Reagan years. For Obama, the average is about 417,000. If we count the size of the undocumented population, the best estimates are that it rose 200,000 per year under Reagan. The highest estimate for Obama is 120,000 per year. We rate the claim False.	None	Deirdre Imus	None	None	None	2014-07-24T16:02:43	2014-07-24	['None']
pomt-09319	"Americans now spend 100 days out of the year working for government before we even start working for ourselves."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/16/sarah-palin/palin-says-americans-spend-100-days-paying-their-t/	On April 14, 2010, former Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin addressed a tea party event in Boston and tried to characterize the scale of the tax burden in the United States. "Americans now spend 100 days out of the year working for government before we even start working for ourselves," she said. By making her point this way, Palin was using a yardstick that receives both attention and criticism every April 15, the day federal tax returns are due. So we thought it would be as good a time as any to look once again at the skirmishing over "Tax Freedom Day." (We last studied the question more than two years ago, when Republican presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee cited a similar statistic.) Tax Freedom Day is the date when "Americans . . . have earned enough money to pay this year's tax obligations at the federal, state and local levels," according to the Tax Foundation, the Washington, D.C.-based group that has calculated it for decades and also determined it retroactively back to 1900. The foundation calculates Tax Freedom Day by taking the amount of tax revenue collected and dividing it by national income created, producing "an average tax burden for the U.S. economy as a whole." That percentage is then multiplied by 365 to calculate the number of days over the course of a year it would take to pay off the entire tax burden. (The calculation counts every day of the year, not adjusting for weekends, holidays or leap years.) To determine tax revenue, the foundation adds together individual income taxes paid at every governmental level; payroll taxes, the federal levies that fund Social Security and Medicare; sales and excise taxes, which are typically collected at the state and local level; corporate income taxes; property taxes; and other miscellaneous taxes such as those for car licenses, energy or mineral production and estates. The Tax Foundation also offers state-specific Tax Freedom Days. These range from 85 for Alaska (Palin's home state) and Louisiana to 117 for higher-tax Connecticut. But the national average is 99. So if we measure Palin by how closely her figure tracks with the current Tax Freedom Day statistic, she scores well. She rounded up from 99 to 100 -- close enough in our book -- and she used the national average rather than any state figure, which is appropriate. Still, before giving Palin the Truth-O-Meter seal of approval, we need to determine whether she described the number's meaning accurately. And this requires delving into the annual debate over how useful the Tax Freedom Day concept is. The Tax Foundation's loyal antagonist in this annual battle is the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. CBPP doesn't suggest that Tax Freedom Day is a bad statistic; it acknowledges that it's a perfectly fine tool if you need to compare the level of taxation in different countries, or measure how the tax burden has changed over time. However, CBPP does cite a number of complaints. We're ignoring a bunch that aren't addressed by Palin's comment, such as concerns over how the state-by-state tax burdens are calculated. The one criticism by CBPP that we do think is relevant to Palin's comment is the argument that Tax Freedom Day ignores differences in how much Americans of different income levels pay in taxes. The Tax Foundation's number represents an average tax burden for the economy as a whole. But CBPP argues that the foundation's number is not a good measure of what a "typical" taxpayer pays. To explain the difference, CBPP offers the following example: "Suppose four families with incomes of $50,000 each pay $2,500 in taxes — 5 percent of their income — while one wealthy family with income of $300,000 pays $90,000 in taxes — 30 percent of its income. Total income among these five families is $500,000, and the total amount paid in taxes is $100,000. Thus, 20 percent of the total income of the five families goes to pay taxes. But the 20 percent figure is highly misleading as an indicator of the typical tax burden for families in this group," since four of the five families have tax rates just one-fourth of that amount. This is obviously an extreme case, and William Ahern, the Tax Foundation's director of policy and communications, countered that in the real world of taxation, the differences between taking a strict average (as the Tax Foundation does) and using a median figure (which would more closely reflect patterns of income distribution) aren't that great. CBPP cites research showing that the difference is significant. CBPP argues that there's enough income inequality in the United States, and enough progressivity in the tax code, to undermine the usefulness of Tax Freedom Day calculations. That's because a sizable majority of taxpayers must work significantly fewer days to pay off their tax bill -- and a minority must work significantly more days. So any attempt to suggest that Tax Freedom Day represents the experience of a typical American -- as opposed to one on the higher end of the income spectrum -- may be problematic. The good news for the Truth-O-Meter is that we don't have to resolve this dispute in order to rate Palin's comment -- we only need to make sure that Palin described accurately the statistic she was using. The bad news in this particular case is that Palin's phrasing is a bit elliptical, making it difficult to parse her words. Palin said, "Americans now spend 100 days out of the year working for government before we even start working for ourselves." That's pretty close to what the Tax Foundation said in its own release -- "Americans will work well over three months of the year — from Jan. 1 to April 9 — before they have earned enough money to pay this year's tax obligations at the federal, state and local levels." Both Palin and the Tax Foundation avoid saying that Tax Freedom Day represents the experience of "a typical American," which would have been a more problematic phrasing. Our graduated tax system, which is weighted more heavily on the wealthy, means that the average amount paid is skewed upward by a smaller number of wealthy people who pay a lot. In other words, there are many, many more people who would fall under the 100-day threshold mentioned by Palin than over it. We think listeners take Palin as referring to what a typical American pays in taxes, since she didn't specify otherwise. Leaving that impression in listeners' minds, we knock her statement down to Mostly True.	None	Sarah Palin	None	None	None	2010-04-16T11:21:44	2010-04-14	['United_States']
pomt-02134	A 2013 state law would allow the operator of an iron ore mine in northern Wisconsin to "fill in pristine streams and ponds with mine waste."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/may/08/dan-kaufman/Dan-Kaufman-claims-wisconsins-new-mining-law-would/	Debate over the proposed Gogebic Taconite iron ore mine in far northern Wisconsin has quieted since the 2013 passage of a state law relaxing environmental protections for iron mining. But it has not disappeared. Gogebic wants to build a $1.5 billion open pit iron mine in the Penokee Range in Iron and Ashland counties, and has begun what is expected to be a long permitting process with the state Department of Natural Resources. The agency is one of several, including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, that will weigh in on the project. Company officials and state business leaders say the mine will provide thousands of jobs in an economically depressed part of the state. Opposition comes from environmentalists, some local residents and members of the Bad River band of the Chippewa, whose reservation lies near the site. Opponents have dug in -- some literally in a North Woods encampment, and some in higher profile venues such as the pages of the Sunday New York Times. Environmental arguments against the project dominated a March 29, 2014 opinion piece in the Times by Wisconsin native Dan Kaufman, a writer and musician who now lives in Brooklyn N.Y. (Kaufman is also a fact checker who works as a freelancer for the Times.) Kaufman’s piece was titled "The Fight for Wisconsin’s soul" and detailed the size and scope of what all agree will be an immense project. (In a separate item, we rated Half True a Kaufman claim that the mine "could be extended as long as 21 miles.") Gogebic had a hand in drafting the 2013 law, which Kaufman says would give the company "astonishing latitude" when it came to building the mine -- including this startling claim: "The new law allows the company to fill in pristine streams and ponds with mine waste." When asked for backup, Kaufman said portions of the law, Section 295, mandate that the state approve the filling of ponds and streams, providing the company re-creates -- the legal term is mitigates -- the filled-in area in another location. "So, an applicant shall receive DNR approval if they do something to ‘mitigate or compensate’ for the destruction elsewhere," Kaufman said in an email interview. But that important point was not mentioned in his original piece. In the interview, Kaufman noted the law doesn’t say where the company would have to do the mitigation work. It could, he argued, be nowhere near the mine. Kaufman’s overall interpretation of the mining law is correct, said Larry Lynch, a hydrogeologist with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. He is the agency’s top official overseeing the project. For years, state law has allowed developers who build on wetlands to re-create an equivalent wetlands in another location. The mining law applied a similar standard to some bodies of water that would be affected by the Gogebic project, Lynch said. "You can do that under limited situations," he said. "If they are going to have to impact surface waters, they can propose to mitigate." The law applies to small lakes and streams -- lakes that are smaller than two acres and streams that have a watershed smaller than two square miles. The question of where Gogebic will store waste rock is an important aspect of the mine project. That’s because to get at the iron deposits, the company will have to dig out and remove tons of undesired material from two pits that are each estimated to be two miles long. The rock that’s embedded with the iron is then removed, crushed and the iron removed with giant magnets. Preliminary plans call for the waste rock to be piled on the surface of the ground, an enormous pile called a "waste facility." Lynch said the company has not told the state where on the site they propose to locate such a facility -- or said whether any bodies of water could be affected. Tentative plans call for Gogebic to use waste rock from the second pit to backfill the first pit, while the remaining rock would remain on the surface. At this point, the company has not proposed filling in any streams or ponds. "It will depend on the design submitted at that time," Lynch said. "They may lay it out so that it doesn’t have any impact on streams or lakes." Our rating The state law aimed at paving the way for the Gogebic mine relaxed environmental regulations for iron mining, and sped up the permit process, steps aimed at giving the company more certainty. Kaufman says that law also lets the company "fill in pristine streams and ponds with mine waste." Kaufman’s correct that the new mining law allows streams and ponds to be filled in at the mining site. But he left out an important point -- that before that takes place the company and state would have to strike a deal for comparable streams and ponds to be created elsewhere. We rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Dan Kaufman	None	None	None	2014-05-08T04:59:00	2014-03-29	['Wisconsin']
pomt-05456	"The total unemployment rate for Hispanic or Latino workers has increased from 10% to 10.3%" between January 2009 and March 2012.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/apr/24/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-hispanic-unemployment-has-risen-u/	In a mid April Pew poll, Mitt Romney trailed President Barack Obama among Hispanic voters, who gave the president a whopping 67 percent to 27 percent margin. In an effort to bolster his standing with this key electoral group, Romney’s campaign on April 20, 2012, released a statistical graphic that takes a shot at Obama’s record on Hispanic unemployment. Among the statistics cited was this one: "The total unemployment rate for Hispanic or Latino workers has increased from 10% to 10.3%." The time frame was between January 2009 and March 2012. We decided to take a closer look. We turned to unemployment data produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official agency for such numbers. We found that the Hispanic unemployment rate in January 2009 was indeed 10.0 percent, and the rate in March 2012 -- the most recent month available -- was 10.3 percent. But that isn’t the whole story. Obama took office on Jan. 20, 2009, about two-thirds of the way through the month. One could just as easily have considered the first month on his watch to be February 2009 -- the first month during which he was president for the entire time. And if you start the clock in February 2009, just one month later, the picture is significantly different. In February 2009, the Hispanic unemployment rate was 11.1 percent. Using that as the baseline, Hispanic unemployment fell by eight-tenths of a percentage point by March 2012 -- instead of rising three-tenths of a percentage point. The fact that there is a major difference if you move the starting point by just one month is not surprising. Hispanics are heavily represented in the construction industry, a sector that was hit unusually hard in the first year of the recession. Indeed, job prospects for Hispanics were in a free fall by the time Obama took office. In the year-long span between January 2008 and January 2009 -- a period when George W. Bush was president -- Hispanic unemployment rose from 6.5 percent to 10.0 percent, far faster than it did during Obama’s tenure even if you do begin counting in January 2009. The point isn't that starting the count in February is vastly superior to starting in January. But when two plausible options offer such widely divergent results, picking the one that spins the claim in a way much more favorable to Romney is clearly cherry-picking. In the meantime, there’s also an argument -- one we’ve made before -- that it’s unfair to blame Obama for job losses very early in his term. In fact, the pattern seen when you start in February only gets stronger the further you go into Obama’s first year. If you start counting six months into his tenure, the reduction in Hispanic unemployment on his watch has been 2.2 percentage points, and if you start counting nine months into his tenure, it's been 2.7 percentage points -- a sharply different scenario than the one in Romney’s graphic. One additional factor: There’s a lot of uncertainty in the data that casts doubt on whether it can be used to support sweeping conclusions. When you slice the monthly unemployment data by ethnic groups, such as Hispanics, "the sample sizes become small enough to introduce a fair amount of sampling error into the resulting statistics," said Steven J. Davis, an economist at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, who served as an outside adviser to John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign. Davis noted that according to BLS, the approximate margin of error for the monthly unemployment rate for Hispanics is 0.34. That’s more than twice as wide as the margin of error for the measurements of men and women, and more than three times as wide as the margin of error for unemployment figures for the population as a whole. So in reality, the January 2009 figure might have been as high as 10.3 percent instead of 10 and the March 2012 figure could have been as low as 10 percent instead of 10.3. (Or it could have risen from 9.7 percent to 10.6 percent over the same period -- we just don’t know.) "It is hard to say whether the January or February 2009 data provide a more accurate indication of the likely Hispanic unemployment rate at the beginning of the Obama Administration," Davis said. "Similar points apply to the March 2012 measure." Our ruling The Romney campaign said that "the total unemployment rate for Hispanic or Latino workers has increased from 10% to 10.3%" between January 2009 and March 2012. The numbers the Romney team cites are accurate, but they may not be statistically significant, and if you use equally plausible time frames, the numbers tell a dramatically different story. These amount to missing critical facts that would have given a different impression. That's our definition of Mostly False.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-04-24T12:14:46	2012-04-20	['None']
pomt-02501	Of minimum wage workers in Rhode Island "only 14 percent serve as sole income earner for their family."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/feb/14/mike-stenhouse/minimum-wage-workers-rhode-island-only-14-percent-/	Michael Stenhouse, chief executive officer of the Rhode Island Center for Freedom and Prosperity, frequently appears on radio and in public forums to argue for lower taxes and, lately, to oppose efforts to increase Rhode Island’s minimum wage. Since July of 2009 the federal minimum wage has been $7.25 an hour. States are free to set their own minimum wage rates, as long as they don’t go below the federal level. Last year, the General Assembly increased Rhode Island’s minimum wage to $8 an hour, effective Jan. 1, 2014, and there are proposals to increase it further. Stenhouse argues that the economic effects of raising the minimum wage are exaggerated by those who want to increase it. Most workers who support a family are already getting more than the minimum wage, he says, while those earning the minimum wage are usually young people supplementing an already above-the-minimum combined family income. On Jan. 27, in a news release, Stenhouse quantified that claim. Of Rhode Islanders who are earning minimum wage, he said, "only 14 percent serve as sole income earner for their family." When we asked Stenhouse about his statement, he said the source of the data was the Employment Policies Institute, a business-backed, Washington, D.C.-based organization that produces research critical of state and federal minimum wages. The employment institute prepared the research for the Rhode Center for Freedom and Prosperity last spring, when the General Assembly was considering raising the minimum wage to $8.25, so that was the figure used in the study. The legislature wound up approving an $8-an-hour minimum wage. The report is posted on the Center for Freedom and Prosperity’s website, rifreedom.org, with a pie chart that illustrates its findings. Michael Saltsman, research director of the Employment Policies Institute, told us that its analysis was derived from a regular monthly survey conducted by the Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics in which people are asked about their incomes and family status, among other things. The institute found that, of Rhode Islanders earning less than $8.25-an-hour, 8 percent were single parents and 6 percent were married and the sole family earner. Stenhouse said he added those together to get his 14 percent. He said he picked those two categories specifically, because he was focusing on families getting by on minimum wage. We weren’t able to recreate Saltsman’s results, but other groups that have used the same data have ended up with similar findings. Heidi Shierholz is an economist with the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group, based in Washington, D.C., that advocates increasing the minimum wage. She said the numbers Stenhouse used didn’t seem out of line, but she added he was carving a narrow demographic slice from the total population affected by minimum wage increases. But, as Stenhouse points out, he specifically limited his statement to families, not the broader category of households. Our ruling Michael Stenhouse says only 14 percent of Rhode Islanders earning minimum wage or less are the sole earners for their families. Stenhouse was citing figures from an established research group that another research group, with an opposite political philosophy, found to be credible. The study he cited was based on an $8.25 wage, rather than Rhode Island’s $8 rate. But that’s not enough to make a big difference. We rule his claim True.

pomt-14365	Says Donald Trump promised "to take care of everybody (through government-run healthcare and) the government's going to pay for it."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/21/club-growth/club-growth-claim-ignores-key-points-donald-trumps/	Club For Growth is trying to make it appear that Donald Trump is in favor of more government-run health care. In a television ad attacking the billionaire Republican, the conservative Washington-based anti-tax group features a female announcer stating, "Some people think government-run, taxpayer-paid health care is a disaster, and some don't." The commercial cuts to Democrat Hillary Clinton promising "we will have quality affordable healthcare for every American," and then to CBS News anchor Scott Pelley questioning Trump by declaring, "Universal healthcare," and Trump responding, "I'm going to take care of everybody." There's a quick cut back to Pelley asking, "Who pays for it?" and Trump responding, "The government's going to pay for it." The announcer continues, "Ask Donald Trump why he sides with Hillary Clinton and why he wants more government healthcare." For this fact check, we will try to look at whether Club For Growth was accurately depicting Trump's stand. In the Republican debates, Trump has repeatedly called for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Obamacare is not government-run health care. It is, however, a system of private insurance plans where the government sets minimum standards for those plans, helps people compare plans and sign up for a plan through a "marketplace," subsidizes some of the cost for low-income people, and penalizes people who don't purchase a plan. Trump has consistently characterized that system as "a disaster." So why is Club for Growth saying that Trump wants more government healthcare? First, we checked to see if the group accurately portrayed what Trump said. We located the Pelley interview and found the group had taken his points out of context. The interview aired on 60 Minutes on Sept. 27. As always, Trump attacks the act. "What's your plan for Obamacare?" Pelley asks. "Obamacare's going to be repealed and replaced," says Trump. "Obamacare is a disaster if you look at what's going on with premiums where they're up 45, 50, 55 percent." (A claim with cherry-picked data that PolitiFact later ruled to be Half True.) Pelley asks, "How do you fix it?" "There's many different ways, by the way. Everybody's got to be covered," says Trump. "This is an un-Republican thing for me to say because a lot of times they say, 'No, no, the lower 25 percent that can't afford private.' But —" At this point, Pelley seems to interrupt. "Universal health care?" he asks. "I am going to take care of everybody," Trump says. "I don't care if it costs me votes or not. Everybody's going to be taken care of much better than they're taken care of now." Pelley: "The uninsured person is going to be taken care of how?" Trump: "They're going to be taken care of. I would make a deal with existing hospitals to take care of people. And, you know what, if this is probably —" Pelley: "Make a deal? Who pays for it?" "The government's gonna pay for it," Trump says. "But we're going to save so much money on the other side." Yet in the next breath, the candidate seems to talk about people buying their own plans, a key point Club for Growth has left out. "But for the most part, it's going to be a private plan and people are going to be able to go out and negotiate great plans with lots of different competition with lots of competitors with great companies and they can have their doctors, they can have plans, they can have everything," he says. We note that some of the goals Trump is talking about are very similar to the goals of Obamacare, which was an attempt to get everyone covered, let private plans provide the coverage, let the private plans compete for customers and let people have their own doctors. (That last element wasn't fulfilled for some people who found they could not, despite President Barack Obama's vow, keep their old health plan and, by extension, may have been forced to use a different physician. In addition, although he told Pelley, "Everybody's got to be covered," the healthcare plan on his website calls for eliminating the Obamacare penalty for not purchasing insurance. "No person should be required to buy insurance unless he or she wants to," it says. Trump has also expressed support for other ideas that go beyond the ACA, such as letting insurers market the same plans across state lines, letting taxpayers deduct health insurance premiums the way businesses do, expanding the use of Health Savings Accounts so any member of a family can tap into it without penalty and make them inheritable, and allowing the government to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies for lower drug prices, a change in federal law that, he says, would save about $300 billion a year. But none of these proposals constitute more government-run, government-paid healthcare, and Trump has said he opposes a single-payer system. We contacted both Club for Growth and the Trump campaign about the ad and Trump's plans, but we didn't get a response. Our ruling Club for Growth says Trump promises "to take care of everybody (through government-run healthcare and) the government's going to pay for it." It's clear from Trump's website and some of his public comments that he wants a market-based approach to healthcare, not a system run by the government, which makes the Club for Growth ad wrong. Because Trump wants a program to cover the poor — "the lower 25 percent that can't afford private" insurance — doesn't mean, as the ad contends, that "he wants more government healthcare." After all, the poor already get health coverage under Medicaid, which is jointly funded by the states and the federal government. We rate Club for Growth's claim False.

pomt-13326	Says Donald Trump "hasn’t broken his promise" to release his tax returns.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/05/mike-pence/pences-false-claim-trump-hasnt-broken-tax-return-p/	Donald Trump’s tax returns became a fiery point of contention between vice presidential nominees Tim Kaine and Mike Pence in their first and only debate. "Donald Trump started this campaign in 2014, and he said, ‘If I run for president, I will absolutely release my taxes,’ " Kaine charged. "He's broken his first — " "And he will," Pence interjected. "He's broken his first promise," Kaine insisted. "He hasn't broken his promise," Pence said. "Look, Donald Trump has filed over 100 pages of financial disclosure, which is what the law requires. The American people can review that. And he's going -- senator, he's going to release his tax returns when the audit is over." "Richard Nixon released tax returns when he was under audit," Kaine countered accurately, before the moderator directed the discussion to Social Security. Kaine was referencing a 2014 interview Trump did with Irish TV. While he didn't use those exact words, Kaine's quote is largely accurate. That was before Trump was actually running for president. But Trump has said he would release his tax returns multiple times since annoucning his candidacy as well. "Will you release any of your tax returns for the public to scrutinize?" NBC’s Chuck Todd asked Trump in January 2016. "Well, we're working on that now. I have very big returns, as you know, and I have everything all approved and very beautiful and we'll be working that over in the next period of time, Chuck. Absolutely," Trump replied. A few weeks later, Trump told the Today Show in February 2016 that he’ll release his tax returns "probably over the next few months." Since those comments, Trump has repeated the promise but with conditions. Recently, he’s said he would release them once Clinton releases all of her emails. And as Pence mentioned, Trump has said repeatedly he has yet to do so because an ongoing IRS audit. (He’s also suggested he probably won't before election day.) According to his tax attorneys, Trump has been "under continuous examination by the Internal Revenue Service since 2002." But he’s also promised to release his tax returns without this condition and, presumably, while under audit in 2011, 2014 and 2015. As Buzzfeed reported, Trump suggested he’d "love" to release his tax returns in 2011, when he was flirting with a presidential bid and questioning Barack Obama’s birthplace. "Maybe I’m going to do the tax returns when Obama does his birth certificate," Trump said in an April 18, 2011, interview with ABC. "I may tie my tax returns, I’d love to give my tax returns, I may tie my tax returns into Obama’s birth certificate." When the White House released Obama’s birth certificate a week later, Trump told ABC he would fulfill his pledge and release his tax records "at the appropriate time." A few years later, Trump had yet to release his tax returns, prompting an Irish television host to ask him about it in a May 2014 interview. "You questioned his citizenship during his campaign, and you said afterwards if he produced that long-form birth certificate, you’d produce your tax returns. But you didn’t do it, did you?" asked TV3’s Colette Fitzpatrick. "Well I don’t know, did he do it?" Trump said. "If I decide to run for office, I’ll produce my tax returns, absolutely and I would love to do that." Trump also repeatedly agreed to release his tax returns in a February 2015 interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. If he ran for president, Trump said, "I would release tax returns and I’d also explain to people that as a person that’s looking to make money — you know, I’m in the business of making money until I do this — and if I won, I would make money for our country." "How many years back?" Hewitt asked. "Three years, five years?" "The answer is I would do it. But I will tell you upfront, as a private person, and I’m very proud of this, I want to pay as little taxes as I can as a private person," Trump said. "Of course. That’s the American way. Legally," Hewitt agreed. "But how many years back would you go back? Three, five? "I don’t know. I actually have not even thought of that. But I would certainly show tax returns if necessary. Well, what have they been doing? They’ve been really doing one year other than people that never made anything. But I would certainly — I’m very proud of what I’ve done. I do pay tax, but I’m very proud of what I’ve done," Trump said. "I have no objection to showing any tax return." Nineteen months later, and five weeks before the Nov. 8 election, Trump still has not released any returns. Our ruling Pence said Trump "hasn't broken his promise" to release his tax returns. Trump said he would "absolutely" release his tax returns in January 2016 and that it'll happen "probably over the next few months" in February without the stipulation of an IRS audit. He also made the promise in 2011, 2014 and 2015 without conditions. There’s still 33 days left before Election Day, so Trump still has time to honor this pledge. But, as of Oct. 4, 2016, when Pence made his claim, Trump has yet to show the public the money. We rate Pence’s claim False.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c16efa7a-3fbe-4856-b346-c47835a06d8b	None	Mike Pence	None	None	None	2016-10-05T17:08:21	2016-10-04	['None']
pomt-04264	"Wisconsin still ranks first among the 50 states in manufacturing jobs per capita."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/nov/11/rebecca-kleefisch/Rebecca-Kleefisch-says-Wisconsin-ranks-first-among/	Wisconsin’s is unmatched nationally on a key jobs measure, Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch asserted while promoting a fall summit of small-business owners and officials of Gov. Scott Walker’s administration. "You probably already know we lead the nation in making cheese, and you definitely know the Packers will always be at the top," Kleefisch said while delivering the governor’s statewide radio address Nov. 1, 2012. "But did you know that Wisconsin still ranks first among the 50 states in manufacturing jobs per capita? That’s right!" Kleefisch’s radio statement also ran as an opinion piece that was published by various new outlets. It’s well documented that Walker promised in the 2010 governor’s race that Wisconsin would add 250,000 private-sector jobs by the end of his first term, in January 2015. Through nearly two years of his four-year term, job gains total 31,911. It’s also pretty well known that Wisconsin has lost a big chunk of its manufacturing sector going back a decade or more. So is it possible the state is still the king of making things? There’s more than one way to skin this statistical cat, but Wisconsin scores high on several manufacturing-job measures. Manufacturing dependency: The factory sector here employs a bigger share of the state's workers than any other state except Indiana, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported on Oct. 7, 2012. Idaho-based Economic Modeling Specialists Intl. reported in March 2012 that "Indiana is 86% more concentrated in manufacturing than average and just nudges Wisconsin for the top spot in our analysis." Indiana is home to Subaru and Honda auto plants, which give the state a boost. Manufacturing vs. government jobs: Calculations by the Wisconsin Budget Project have shown that Wisconsin and Indiana are neck-and-neck for the highest ratio of manufacturing jobs to government jobs in the nation -- a ratio viewed by some as a good measure of a state’s economic health. But Kleefisch referred to a third measure: Manufacturing jobs per capita. We located U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports and crunched the numbers behind her claim. We separately enlisted Jon Peacock, research director of the Wisconsin Budget Project, an arm of the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families. Wisconsin -- as Kleefisch claimed -- tops Indiana and every other state when you compare factory jobs to the overall state population. Peacock took a slightly different tack, comparing those jobs to the overall pool of potential workers -- the non-institutional population age 16 and older. "Wisconsin is #1, and by a much larger margin than I anticipated," Peacock said. "What I found is that 10 percent of Wisconsin’s population age 16 and older works in manufacturing. Indiana is #2 at 9.6 percent, followed by Iowa at 9.1 percent, and Kansas at 7.5 percent. The national average is 4.9 percent." That’s good news and bad news, Peacock said. It’s a point of pride -- and manufacturing jobs are extremely important for Wisconsin. But the state economy might be stronger if it diversified and became less dependent upon a sector that will probably continue to decline as a percentage of the national workforce, Peacock said. Kleefisch, though, is on target with the numbers. Part of the explanation is that Wisconsin dropped a smaller share of its manufacturing jobs than many other big factory-reliant states in the 2000s. Those job losses in the sector began to reverse in about January 2010, both nationally and in Wisconsin. Walker took office in January 2011. Still, though, Wisconsin is 150,000 manufacturing jobs short of its January 2000 total, according to September 2012 federal figures. Our rating Kleefisch claimed that Wisconsin "still ranks first among the 50 states in manufacturing jobs per capita." Economists debate the wisdom of heavy reliance on that sector, but Kleefisch accurately describes the state’s ranking. We rate her statement True.

pomt-02687	Fifty-three percent of graduates from liberal arts colleges these days can’t find jobs.	false	/georgia/statements/2014/jan/07/johnny-isakson/isakson-doesnt-make-grade-his-claim-about-college-/	Parents who scrimp, save and borrow to put their children through college don’t like hearing that a four-year degree may not be the door-opener they hoped. But that’s what U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, among others, is out there saying. And Isakson is pointing fingers at a specific type of school -- liberal arts colleges. "Career academies are the future," Isakson said at a Dec. 4 town hall meeting in Coweta County. "Fifty-three percent of graduates from liberal arts academies couldn’t find employment, but almost 89 percent who graduated from technical schools did so." Isakson repeated the claim about liberal arts school students in a visit to The Newnan Times-Herald on the same day. Those are steep unemployment statistics for college graduates of any stripe. PolitiFact Georgia decided to do some homework on the senator’s numbers. Isakson based his statement on data developed by The Associated Press in 2012 with help from researchers. Those numbers show 1.5 million adults, or 53.6 percent of bachelor’s degree-holders under age 25, were either jobless or underemployed in 2011. In both Georgia appearances, Isakson applied the worrisome AP statistics to liberal arts school graduates. But the AP report was about all graduates, not any specific degree holders. "I am certain that Sen. Isakson’s intent was to convey the general message of the AP study," said Lauren Culbertson, the senator’s deputy communications director. Isakson is hardly the first to cite the AP report, which some education researchers say overstated the difficulties that graduates were having finding employment or landing jobs that matched their skills. Just a day before he visited Coweta County, Isakson attended the Cobb County Economic Forecast breakfast, where Albert Niemi Jr., nationally acclaimed dean of the Cox School of Business at Southern Methodist University, gave a speech that referenced a 2012 article in The Atlantic on the AP findings. Niemi said about half of the college graduates between 2007 and 2012 were unemployed or underemployed. He used the findings to make the case that a college diploma isn’t worth what it once was and that today’s graduates need teachable "hard skills," if they hope to get hired. Isakson left the Cobb breakfast with a hard copy of Niemi’s PowerPoint presentation, Culbertson said. Anthony P. Carnevale, director and research professor at the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, said the 2012 report "grossly misrepresents the truth" about college grads in general. The unemployment rate for college graduates is under 5 percent now, Carnevale said. In 2011, it was about 7 percent for new college graduates, substantially less than the unemployment rate for high school graduates, he said. It was that way throughout the Great Recession, Carnevale said. "College unemployment went up, but much less than the unemployment rates of non-college graduates," he said. "The value of college is still high." Other educators and researchers say they see nothing to reflect major struggles for liberal arts school graduates as opposed to other degree holders. The Association of American Colleges and Universities is about to release a report that suggests the unemployment rate for liberal arts graduates is quite low and not much higher than other graduates, said Debra Humphreys, the association's vice president for policy and public engagement. Enrollment has been "strong" at the public liberal arts colleges and universities that are part of the North Carolina-based Council of Public Liberal Arts Colleges, said Bill Spellman, the consortium’s director. "Students and parents are feeling that that well-rounded education is going to be an advantage, if not initially, then midway in their careers," Spellman said. They see the importance of having "those transferable skills of critical thinking, writing and speaking and of being able to be nimble for jobs that haven’t even been created," he said. Colleges throughout Georgia offer bachelor of arts degrees. And at Georgia College in Milledgeville, the state’s only recognized public liberal arts college, 78 percent of students in the Class of 2012 reported having jobs within three months of graduation, said Brittiny Barber Johnson, the college’s manager of media relations. The results were based on responses from 241 of the 1,136 undergraduates who received their degrees in May 2012, Johnson said. Of the students who responded, 43 percent said they were working in a job "highly related" to their major, she said. But to people who listened to Isakson at a town hall meeting at the Coweta campus of West Georgia Technical College, a much different picture emerged. Isakson told the audience 53 percent of graduates from liberal arts academies weren’t finding jobs. By contrast, he said nearly 89 percent of tech school graduates had landed jobs. Mike Light, longtime spokesman for the Technical College System of Georgia, said Isakson's numbers for the state’s technical schools appear spot-on. Officials at individual technical schools are seeing about 90 percent of their graduates finding jobs and, systemwide, that number is about 85 percent, Light said. "They’ve got the in-demand careers," he said. So where does that leave us? Isakson said that 53 percent of graduates from liberal arts colleges can’t find a job. On the face of it, he incorrectly quoted an AP report, which makes no attempt to single out liberal arts graduates and their ability to find work. He also failed to mention that the 53 percent figure included not only jobless grads, but also many people who were finding jobs, albeit in lower-paying positions than one might expect. And even that report is viewed with suspicion in some quarters. Some college graduates are having trouble finding work. Isakson is correct about that. But his statement misquotes numbers in a study that itself has been questioned. We rate Isakson’s statement False.	None	Johnny Isakson	None	None	None	2014-01-07T06:00:00	2013-12-04	['None']
pomt-05147	"(Assembly Democrats) wanted to raise the gas tax by $2.4 billion. We said no to that....They’re down on the ground. They’re sweating. They’re twitching. It’s ugly, ‘cause I keep saying no."	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jun/21/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-he-stopped-assembly-democrat/	The way Gov. Chris Christie makes it sound, Democrats in the state Assembly are a bunch of crazed junkies looking for their next fix of raising taxes and he’s the one forcing them into withdrawal. At a June 13 town hall meeting in Atlantic County, the Republican governor pointed to his opposition to a proposed gas tax increase as an example of him fighting off the Democrats’ addiction. "Now I’ve been governor now for over 800 days and we vetoed two income tax increases. They wanted to raise the gas tax by $2.4 billion. We said no to that," said Christie, according to a video posted June 14 on YouTube. "Imagine now if you’re paying 20 to 25 cents more a gallon. That’s what the Assembly Democrats would have gotten for you. We’re saying no to all that stuff. "So now…you got to see what’s happening with the Assembly Democrats. They’re like people going through withdrawals. They haven’t gotten to raise a tax in over 800 days. They’re down on the ground. They’re sweating. They’re twitching. It’s ugly, ‘cause I keep saying no." Such colorful language, and yet so misleading, PolitiFact New Jersey found. There has been a proposal to raise the motor fuels tax by about $2.4 billion, but despite Christie’s suggestion, it hasn’t been pushed by the Assembly Democratic leadership and stopped by the governor. In fact, the legislation has never made it to the governor’s desk for him to take any action. State Assemblyman Albert Coutinho (D-Essex) has introduced the bill twice over the last roughly two years, but has never received additional legislative sponsors or a committee hearing. The full Assembly has never voted on the proposal. As Coutinho put it, "this bill is going nowhere." First introduced in May 2010, Coutinho’s bill called for annual increases of 8-cents-per-gallon in fiscal years 2011 through 2013. According to the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services, those increases were projected to generate a total of about $2.4 billion over the three-year period to go toward the state’s Transportation Trust Fund. Coutinho said the tax hike would allow the state to stop borrowing for the fund, which supports various transportation projects. But the bill, which Coutinho reintroduced in January for the current legislative session, hasn’t moved an inch since being referred to an Assembly committee. "Leadership’s not looking to do this," Coutinho told us. "Nobody seems willing to politically have that conversation." Tom Hester Jr., a spokesman for the Assembly Democrats, explained that Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver does not support raising the gas tax. "Hundreds if not thousands of bills are proposed each session without getting a hearing. Nothing unusual about it at all," Hester said in an e-mail. "The governor is once again misleading the public." Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak noted how other Democrats have indicated support for a gas tax increase, including state Sen. Raymond Lesniak and state Assemblyman and state Democratic Party chairman John Wisniewski. As for Christie’s role in stopping such a tax hike, Drewniak added: "The Governor was emphatic many times amid this discussion by Democrats that he would not sign legislation increasing the gasoline tax and add a new tax burden on over-taxed New Jersey residents. "The unambiguous promise of a veto is often just as effective in stopping legislation in its tracks as is the actual act of a veto." Our ruling At a town hall meeting, Christie claimed Assembly Democrats "wanted to raise the gas tax by $2.4 billion. We said no to that." Now Democrats are "down on the ground. They’re sweating. They’re twitching. It’s ugly, ‘cause I keep saying no," Christie added. The governor’s right about there being a Democratic proposal to raise the motor fuels tax by about $2.4 billion, but Assembly Democratic leaders have stopped the bill from moving forward. Since its first introduction in May 2010, the bill has never received additional legislative sponsors or a committee hearing. Since Christie’s claim "ignores critical facts that would give a different impression," we rate the statement Mostly False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-01665	"In six years, (U.S. Rep. Gary) Peters introduced zero bills that became law."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/20/ending-spending-action-fund/conservative-group-claims-michigan-senate-candidat/	A group founded by conservative billionaire Joe Ricketts, who spent millions to help Republican Mitt Romney in 2012, is on the air in Michigan where there’s a heated race to replace retiring Democratic Sen. Carl Levin. Ricketts’ group, Ending Spending Action Fund, launched an ad Aug. 13 that attacks the record of Rep. Gary Peters, the Michigan Democrat hoping to succeed Levin. Peters is running against Republican Terri Lynn Land, former Michigan Secretary of State. "Can you think of a single thing he’s accomplished?" a narrator asks in the 30-second spot. A clock ticks. "In six years, Peters introduced zero bills that became law." We decided to see if that’s accurate. Peters was elected in 2008. In that time, he has sponsored 49 bills. A quick search found that four of them passed the House, but none of them made it through the Senate and onto President Barack Obama’s desk. In the past we’ve found that experts are critical of such a narrow measure of legislative success, noting that it hardly captures a lawmaker’s effectiveness or track record for moving legislation. Lawmaking is a collaborative process, so sometimes many people contribute even though only one person is listed as the original sponsor. A deeper dive into Peters’ tenure finds several legislative victories that fly in the face of the ad’s claim. On June 9, Obama signed into law H.R. 724, an act "to amend the Clean Air Act to remove the requirement for dealer certification of new light-duty motor vehicles." Basically, the certificate required for these new vehicles was duplicative, since laws already required these standards to be met during production, thus creating red tape for these dealers. While the bill’s listed sponsor is Rep. Robert Latta, R-Ohio, Peters was widely recognized for his contributions to the bill. Multiple reports indicated that he co-wrote it with Latta, and Peters was listed as the lone "original co-sponsor" of the bill. Latta’s website even says that he "along with Congressman Gary Peters introduced" the legislation. In 2010, Peters sponsored a bill he called the State Small Business Credit Initiative. The bill did not pass the House as standalone legislation. But during the markup of the Small Business Lending Fund Act of 2010 (later called the Small Business Jobs Act) in the House Financial Services Committee on May 19, 2010, Peters offered an amendment to incorporate his bill into the larger legislation. It was approved on 39-23 vote. So essentially, when Obama signed the Small Business Jobs Act, he was also signing Peters’ bill into law. Indeed, Peters’ profile on Congressional Quarterly notes he keeps a pen from Obama’s bill signing in his office, as Peters "was the author of an amendment that created a collateral support program for small businesses struggling to get loans because the capital they owned had decreased in value during the recession." Peters also introduced the Animal Torture Prevention Act of 2010. The bill came in response to a Supreme Court ruling that said an existing law against so-called animal crush videos that show animals being abused was too broad and may violate First Amendment rights. While Peters’ bill did not pass, a similar bill did. Peters’ bill is listed as a "related bill" on Congress’ bill-tracking service because it is "a companion measure, an identical bill, a procedurally-related measure, or one with substantive similarities," according to Congress.gov. Peters has also co-sponsored 44 bills that eventually became law, and was listed as an "original co-sponsor" on five of them. Not all of those bills are significant, nor did he play a significant role in crafting all of them. But within the walls of Congress, he can at least claim partial victory. Those examples don’t include committee work where Peters took part in shaping bills that would later become law. For example, Peters served on the powerful Wall Street Reform Conference Committee that produced the final version of Dodd-Frank, the bill that emerged in the aftermath of the recession and ensuing bailouts. Our ruling The Ending Spending ad claims that Peters hasn't accomplished anything, making this statement: "In six years, Peters introduced zero bills that became law." If you search congressional databases, you won't find a bill introduced solely by Peters that became law. But we found several instances in which Peters was credited with writing the legislation that did become law, sponsoring a bill that became part of a larger package signed by Obama, offering a bill similar to one that became law, or was an original co-sponsor. There’s a shred of truth in the claim by Ending Spending, but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate the claim Mostly False. Update: After we published this piece, we heard from Brian Baker, president of Ending Spending Action Fund. Baker pointed to the evidence (which is included in our fact-check) that Peters was not sole sponsor on any bill that became law and stood by the group’s claim. "First, it is great that PolitiFact acknowledges, as it must, that ‘if you search congressional databases, you won’t find a bill introduced solely by Peters that became law.’ This sentence confirms the truth of the central assertion in our advertisement," Baker said. We stand by our original analysis and keep the rating the same at Mostly False.	None	Ending Spending Action Fund	None	None	None	2014-08-20T10:54:22	2014-08-13	['United_States']
pomt-04458	Bill Nelson "leased land that he owned for six cows, taking advantage of an agricultural tax loophole to dodge $43,000 in taxes just last year."	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/oct/10/american-crossroads/american-crossroads-attacks-bill-nelson-agricultur/	In a TV ad, Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson is a down-home farmer in denim overalls, wielding a pitchfork and tending to six animated cows. The point of the political attack: Nelson is using a farm facade to get out of paying his fair share of property taxes. "After 40 years in politics, Bill Nelson has learned how to milk the system. He leased land that he owned for six cows, taking advantage of an agricultural tax loophole to dodge $43,000 in taxes just last year," says the ad from American Crossroads, the conservative super PAC founded by Karl Rove. "Then he sold the land for home development, pocketing at least $1.4 million." The ad’s kicker: "Tax breaks and big profits for him, higher taxes for the rest of us." This claim echoes past criticism from Nelson’s Republican challenger, U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV. The attacks stem from a February 2012 Tampa Bay Times story that scrutinized Nelson’s qualifications for a "greenbelt" property assessment, a designation that spares him from paying higher property taxes on his family’s 55-acre pasture along the Indian River in Brevard County. Thanks to the "greenbelt" designation, Nelson’s land is taxed at a much lower agricultural rate. We wanted to examine the group’s claim that Nelson used six cows and a loophole to "dodge" $43,000 in his 2011 taxes. Whether he "sold the land for home development" is the subject of another check. Nelson said the Crossroads ad is very misleading. "Of course, they don’t tell you that that has been a cow pasture for 60 years," Nelson said in an interview. "That was my 4-H club project that started in the early ’50s and has been ever since." When the Times story broke, Mack’s campaign rushed to create a singalong cartoon ad called "Udder hypocrisy." Before an animated barn, a hokey Nelson figure and six cows sang, "Bill Nelson’s farm’s the place to be / Just six cows and hypocrisy / Milking taxpayers like you and me / This is typical liberal hypocrisy." ‘An agricultural tax loophole’ The greenbelt law was enacted in 1959 as a financial incentive for farmers to keep their land instead of selling to developers who wanted it for highways, shopping malls and homes. "It costs a lot to farm," said Adam Basford, the Florida Farm Bureau Federation director of legislative affairs. "And a lot of times people could see a higher use in that land for development." Farmers are fond of the greenbelt law. Critics, though, say the law is too generous and too vague. The decision to tax land on the lower agricultural rate is determined by county property appraisers, who must weigh if the land is used "primarily for bona fide agricultural purposes." The lack of specifics in Florida law invites oft-documented abuse. A 2005 investigative series by the Miami Herald chronicled several instances of property owners growing modest plants or paying ranchers to keep cows on their land to garner agricultural tax breaks on land they obviously intended to develop. The classification also creates money gaps for counties that must be made up by other taxpayers or is lost. In 2011, nearly 248,886 properties were classified as agriculture on tax rolls, according to the Florida Department of Revenue. Even though the market value for those properties was $58 billion, the assessed value was just $5 billion. The total lost tax revenues for local governments was about $969 million in 2011. Nelson on the farm Nelson’s camp says his situation is different than the abuses chronicled by the Miami Herald. He gets a greenbelt designation for his Brevard County pasture because he leases the land to small-time cattle owners. The current lessee, cattleman Jeff Darby, has a herd of about six cows and leases the land free of charge, though he is required to keep up with maintenance. The land has been in Nelson’s family since 1924. It’s been a cattle pasture since 1960, including when Nelson raised and sold a herd of cattle to pay for his education at Yale University. Nelson has said he is not abusing the designation because he is preserving the land and keeping it in his family. He used to live in a home attached to the property but sold it when he moved to Tallahassee to serve as Florida’s treasurer and insurance commissioner. Still, the savings is considerable. Without the designation, he would have paid 13 times the amount of taxes that he did in 2011. In 2011, the market value of Nelson’s property was $2.76 million. Nelson got the lower agricultural value of $210,870 in 2011. Instead of paying $48,380 in property taxes, he paid nearly $3,696.66, according to tax records, a difference of more than $44,000. The Brevard County property appraiser’s office has tried to remove Nelson’s greenbelt designation in the past, but Nelson fought to keep it and won in court. (An inspector in 1999 went to his property and found no cows; Nelson argued they escaped via a hole in the fence.) Contrary to the ad’s suggestion, Nelson is not shirking his tax responsibility, a spokesman said, nor is he covertly planning to develop or resell his land. "You are not dodging taxes when you pay all the taxes that are owned on the property," said Dan McLaughlin, his spokesman. Those who scoff at the size of the herd grazing there now should know it’s on par with most cattle businesses in Florida, McLaughlin said. About one-third of Florida farms, or 7,165, are comprised of fewer than nine cattle or calves, according to 2007 federal data. One expert told the Times that Nelson is making an effort to "maintain some aspect of what’s a heritage family site in agriculture." "I think that would be something that the state would encourage," Stan Geberer, who works for Fishkin & Associations, a Florida economic consulting firm, told the Times. Our ruling The ad’s claims and figures about Nelson’s tax bill and Brevard County property are rooted in a report from the Tampa Bay Times. It’s accurate to say that Nelson was shielded from paying about $43,000 in property taxes because of his land has a greenbelt designation. The group emphasizes that Nelson is leasing the land, though the Times story is clear he does not charge for the Melbourne farmer to graze cows there. We think American Crossroads is stretching the truth by claiming Nelson is "dodging" his taxes. That’s a derogatory phrase commonly used for someone who doesn’t pay what they owe. That’s not the case here, though people may disagree with Nelson paying the lower agricultural rate based on the presence of six cows on a vast pasture. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-08811	Said he won the Democratic primary "without one ... negative TV spot."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2010/aug/17/roy-barnes/barnes-said-he-ran-positive-tv-campaign-primary/	The day after last week's nasty primary runoff for the Republican gubernatorial nomination, the Democratic contender, former Gov. Roy Barnes, emerged unbruised. It had been a rancorous couple of weeks for the GOP. Candidate Nathan Deal accused opponent Karen Handel of running an entirely negative campaign, a claim PolitiFact Georgia ruled Mostly True in an earlier item. Handel called Deal "a corrupt relic of Washington, D.C." Supporters of Deal, who won the runoff, claimed Handel supports aborting children with Down syndrome. We ruled that Pants on Fire. Barnes, who won his party's primary without a runoff, took full advantage of the rival party's ugliness during a Channel 2 Action News interview. He called his Republican opponents "honorable people" and said that it's possible to run a campaign without calling names. "Well, you know, I think that we were proud that we ran the Democratic primary without ... one negative TV spot," he told anchor Carol Sbarge. Really? Not a single one? As the front-runner, Barnes didn't need to go negative, Emory University political science professor Merle Black said. Polls consistently indicated Barnes could win the Democratic primary without a runoff. That allowed him to stay on the sunny side of politicking, Black said. "It was not in his interest to run anything negative because he was so far ahead of everybody else," Black said. "One of his main goals is to unify his party, and you don’t do that by going negative." To make sure Barnes played a clean game, we examined his eight 30-second TV campaign spots for evidence of negative campaigning. "Providence" In this commercial, Barnes sits on a pew in a sunny church. A harp plays in the background, and Barnes gives a 'mea culpa' for the sins he committed during his term as governor. At the time, critics complained he was heavy-handed. Voters ousted him in 2002 in favor of Sonny Perdue. "As governor, my heart was in the right place, but I didn’t listen or slow down to explain why I had to make some difficult decisions. For that, I apologize," Barnes says. Barnes' only swipe was against the Georgia General Assembly, which, he says, "plays its games." "Taxes" Sitting before the front porch of a bungalow, Barnes says he has a record of lowering taxes for homeowners. Once again, Barnes' bogeymen are "the politicians under the Gold Dome" who "took away our tax cut" to give money to special interests, he says. "It’s not right. It’s not fair. And when I’m governor, it won’t stand," he finishes. "Chalkboard" This commercial starts with Barnes pointing over a hilly vista, holding what appears to be architectural drawings. "Roy Barnes will make Georgia work again," a male announcer says. The voice adds that the number of jobs in the state grew during Barnes' term as governor, a claim we ruled Half True in a previous item. He also promises to end teacher furloughs "forever" and to "scrub corruption." The commercial reserves its harshest words for the state Legislature and "big business." "Foreclosure" Barnes returns to the bungalow in "Taxes" to plug his plan to ease the suffering of homeowners by ensuring banks negotiate before foreclosing on homes. The commercial features a crying mom, a boy clutching a stuffed elephant and a law enforcement officer who helps the woman carry possessions from her home. The bad guys? Bankers and their lobbyists. "They slapped you on the back to lend you the money and slapped you in the face when you got in trouble," Barnes says. "Education" Barnes sits with ordinary people at a diner and tells them his plans on education. He promises he won't furlough teachers or "cut the school year in order to pay for special-interest tax breaks." "I will make smaller classes. I will increase teachers pay. I will make education No. 1," he says. "Pine Pellets" Sun shines through thick stands of pine trees. Birds twitter and a slide guitar sighs. An announcer pitches Barnes' plans to get Georgia into the renewable energy business and calls the state the "Saudi Arabia of pine trees," a claim we ruled Barely True in a separate item. "When I’m governor, we’ll turn our renewable forests into a job-creating industry," Barnes says. The ad says nothing negative. "State Buildings" This ad featured Roy Barnes' plan "to put people to work -- immediately," as an announcer says. Barnes tells a group of men and women wearing hard hats that he can put tradespeople in jobs retrofitting state buildings for energy independence or efficiency. The group nods in agreement. "I think a paycheck would be great," one man replies. Again, nothing negative. "Travel for Jobs" Barnes walks through an airport, meets with people in a boardroom and concludes "we can’t bring jobs to Georgia with the rest of the country laughing at us." Once again, the General Assembly is the problem, but Barnes doesn't single out any particular legislator. The commercial says the Legislature passed goofy laws about microchips in the brain and stem cell research and talked about seceding from the union, a claim we ruled Mostly True. Those actions make Georgia look too weird for businesses interested in relocating, he says. So did Barnes run an all-positive TV campaign? While Barnes took quick jabs against special interests, banks, lobbyists and the General Assembly, these were mainly brief asides in otherwise positive commercials. The ads focused on his record and campaign promises and made no attacks against specific primary rivals. Two of Barnes' key opponents in the primary agree with Barnes' contention that he kept things positive -- at least on TV -- in the Democratic primary. Russ Willard, a spokesman for state Attorney General Thurbert Baker, said Baker agrees that Barnes kept it clean in the primary. "He [Baker] agreed with that Roy did not run negative TV ads during the primary campaign," Willard said. Another Barnes opponent in the primary, state Rep. DuBose Porter, D-Dublin, said Barnes had such massive statewide name recognition that Barnes did not have to go on the attack. "I think that’s probably correct," Porter said of Barnes’ positive-campaign pronouncement. "He just kept stealing all of my ideas." Still, Barnes' commercials were no love fest. Although he did not target candidates, he bad-mouthed special interests and big business. He also threw some punches at the state Legislature. We rule Barnes' claim Mostly True.

pomt-04741	The Obama administration "even proposed banning farm kids from doing basic chores!"	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/29/john-thune/barack-obama-proposed-banning-farm-kids-doing-basi/	Hey kids on farms! Set down your screwdrivers and bags of seeds! Put your feet up and relax! Fire up the Xbox! The federal officials in the big urban city of Washington D.C. have put a target on family farms and part of that includes banning chores, says Sen. John Thune, R-S.D. "The big-government bureaucrats of the Obama administration have set their sights on our way of life," Thune said during the Republican National Convention in Tampa on Aug. 29. "Instead of preserving family farms and ranches, President Obama's policies are effectively regulating them out of business. His administration even proposed banning farm kids from doing basic chores!" Is it true that Obama’s administration proposed banning farm kids from doing basic chores? We’ve heard similar claims about a proposed U.S. Department of Labor rule change about children working on farms. Members of Congress such as U.S. Rep. Tom Rooney, R-Fla., said the proposed rule "would threaten generations of farm tradition and culture....The language of the proposed rule is so specific it would even ban youth from operating a battery-powered screwdriver or a pressurized garden hose." Rooney was particularly concerned about regulations on power equipment. We ruled his statement Mostly False, though, in April 2012. The proposed rule didn’t specifically mention hoses or screwdrivers, and the Labor Department specifically said it had no intention of banning children from using such equipment. Thune introduced legislation in March 2012 to block the Labor Department from enacting the proposed restrictions. The Labor Department wrote that the goal was to increase safety and provide parity between rules for children working on farms and non-farm settings. The department was specifically concerned about actual cases of minors killed or maimed in incidents with equipment on farms. But the widespread criticism prompted the Labor Department to yank its proposal, which never went into effect. Parental exemption Thune mentioned "family farms," which suggests Obama’s administration wanted to ban kids from doing chores even on their own parents’ farms. By saying "chores" rather than something such as "paid work" Thune seems to also be suggesting that this is work on their own parents’ farms. For decades, though, a parental exemption has allowed children to do any job on a farm owned or operated by their parents. That means if Dad puts using a screwdriver or garden hose on the list of the kids’ chores, the feds won’t raise a fuss. The summary of the proposed rules stated they "would impact only hired farm workers and in no way compromise the statutory child labor parental exemption involving children working on farms owned or operated by their parents." As we wrote in a fact-check of a similar claim from U.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., that meant no matter the government rules, if a parent who owns a farm tells a child to crank up the milking machine, there’s nothing to prohibit it. That seems like an important and broad exception, given that the bill sponsored by Alexander and 44 others has as its title: "Preserving America's Family Farm Act." If you’re working your own parent’s farm, the proposed rules wouldn’t have applied at all. The way the department interpreted that parental exemption -- that farms had to be wholly owned by parents for kids to work -- led to an outpouring of angry letters from family farmers who didn’t quite meet that strict definition. In February, the department announced that it would rework that section by 2012 and any decision on a final rule would follow. But that still left a lot of proposed no-nos for children working somewhere other than their own parents' farms. Children under 16 would have been banned from harvesting tobacco, doing certain work with animals, and working from ladders or structures at elevations higher than 6 feet. Violators would have faced fines, and the government could have stopped shipment on crops. Our ruling Thune said that the Obama administration "even proposed banning farm kids from doing basic chores." There was a proposed rule, prompted by cases of children suffering injury or death while working with agricultural equipment. But the rule did not apply to kids working on their parents' farms. We should note there was controversy because some farmers felt that the Labor Department was interpreting the exemption too strictly. In the end, the whole proposed rule was tossed in the trash by federal officials after an outpouring of complaints. But while the proposal was alive, federal officials did not propose banning children from doing basic chores on their parents’ farms. It's ridiculously false to suggest it applied to children of family farmers and even sillier to say it applied to "chores." Pants on Fire!

pomt-00530	The original compromise for the Confederate battle flag in South Carolina "was to put it on the back side of the statehouse, out of public view so it would not have any appearance of sovereignty."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/21/james-clyburn/james-clyburn-says-original-confederate-flag-compr/	The Confederate flag has returned as a flashpoint in South Carolina politics. While the flags of the United States and the state itself hang at half-staff over the state capitol in honor of the nine victims at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, the Confederate battle flag on the statehouse grounds remains at full-mast. As part of a 2000 law, it remains on statehouse grounds. That law itself was the result of protests and an economic boycott aimed at getting the Confederate flag off of the capitol dome. Over 46,000 people marched in Columbia, and the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce lobbied lawmakers to remove the flag. In what was billed as a compromise, the symbol of the South’s battle against the Union ended up alongside a monument to Confederate soldiers located in front of the statehouse. Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., said that law and that placement effectively betrayed an earlier deal. "The compromise was to put that flag in front of the Wade Hampton office building next to the Wade Hampton statue," Clyburn said on NBC’s Meet the Press on June 21, 2015. "What happened was when some people rejected the compromise, the Legislature, out of defiance, put that flag where it is today in front of the statehouse. That is not what the compromise was. The compromise was to put it on the back side of the statehouse, out of public view so it would not have any appearance of sovereignty." We decided to see if the bill that passed in 2000 undermined a package that had emerged from previous negotiations. To get started, it helps to get a feel for where things are on the statehouse grounds in Columbia. Here’s a map of the statehouse area. From this, Clyburn’s characterization of his preferred location seems pretty accurate. The next question is, did that spot represent a consensus plan? Several ideas in play We reached out to Clyburn’s office and did not hear back by the time we published. However, we did talk to Rep. Gilda Cobb-Hunter, the South Carolina House Democratic minority leader in 2000. Cobb-Hunter remembers the plan Clyburn had in mind, but she also remembers that there were several ideas on the table. "There were a number of conversations back in 2000 held by a number of different people," Cobb-Hunter said. "It would not be accurate to say that there was one plan that had reached a consensus." Cobb-Hunter and a top House Republican lawmaker had co-sponsored a proposal for a new installation on the statehouse grounds that they called the Circle of Flags, in which the Confederate flag would have been one of several from South Carolina’s history. Another approach suggested the flag move to the state’s Confederate Relic and Military History Museum. The plan to place it by the Wade Hampton statue (Hampton was a Confederate Civil War general who served as governor and U.S. senator in the 1870s and 1880s) did have significant support. In February 2000, then-governor Democrat Jim Hodges got behind the move, and at the time, Cobb-Hunter said it was a viable option. But it never caught on, not with House Republicans, nor with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Angela Ledford co-authored a study on the flag controversy while getting her doctorate at the University of South Carolina. Now a political scientist at the College of St. Rose, Ledford remembers that plan as "an informal agreement with some of the legislative leadership." The compromise that emerged -- first in the state Senate and then affirmed in the House -- sent the flag to its present location by the monument to the Confederate Soldier. In a bit of legislative log-rolling, the Senate passed the bill after the House approved making Martin Luther King, Jr. Day a state holiday. South Carolina was the last state in the country to officially recognize MLK Day. The majority of African-American House members voted against the bill, and the NAACP opposed it as well. Our ruling Clyburn said that there was a compromise measure to place the Confederate flag in a more discreet location on the South Carolina state house grounds. Such a proposal did exist and had the backing of the governor and black lawmakers. But it was not the only compromise plan in play and it failed along with other proposals backed by black lawmakers. Clyburn’s claim leaves out that context. We rate it Mostly True.	None	James Clyburn	None	None	None	2015-06-21T17:37:29	2015-06-21	['South_Carolina', 'Confederate_States_of_America']
pomt-05377	Says that U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio says troops are leaving Iraq "too fast."	true	/florida/statements/2012/may/08/wrongwayrubiocom/anti-rubio-group-says-rubio-thinks-troops-are-comi/	A website created by Florida progressives is attacking Sen. Marco Rubio's positions on women's rights, government spending, immigration, Social Security reform and more, pointing out apparent contradictions and allegedly unethical behavior. WrongWayRubio.com, a joint project by Progress Florida and Florida Watch, also takes issue with his foreign policy, a particularly important focus for a potential Republican vice presidential nominee. The site provides terse commentary on several issues, allowing readers to tweet the statements -- and the website's source material for the claim -- through their own Twitter accounts. One of these tweetable missives reads, "Rubio says troops are leaving decade-old war 'too fast'." It refers to Rubio's reaction to President Obama's military exit from Iraq last year. Among many negative claims about the senator, that one caught our attention: What was Rubio's position on the end of the Iraq War? WrongWayRubio.com provides links for each of its tweets, so the first thing we did is click the link. It sends readers to a clip of Rubio on Fox News' Studio B, discussing Obama's drawdown of armed forces from Iraq on Oct. 21, 2011. Obama announced that day U.S. forces would leave the country by the end of the year, which they did on Dec. 15. Right away, there is a difference between what Rubio said and what WrongWayRubio.com implied. What we found didn’t seem to support the tweet’s claim. "Here's my fear," Rubio told acting host Trace Gallagher, "my fear is that if the pull out happens too fast, Iran and their surrogates are going to come in there and take over and start exerting influence and creating havoc for us." Rubio was speaking there in hypothetical and not declarative terms. That means we had to dig deeper to see where the senator really stood on the withdrawal. Rubio has made foreign policy a major focus of his time in the Senate, and he’s been making major speeches on America's role in the world since last year. He has focused primarily on United States policy in Latin America, Europe, and Central and East Asia. But he has used Iraq and the Middle East as examples of a region requiring stronger American involvement. "It has been suggested that the advice of military commanders in Iraq be completely ignored in favor of a dramatic troop drawdown that even Iraqis say is too drastic," Rubio said in a speech in Wingate, N.C., on Sept. 13, 2011. He chided some of his contemporaries as doing only what is "politically self-serving," and not in the best interests of the country. "America, and the entire world for that matter, needs resolute leadership in this era of historic but volatile transformation, particularly in the Middle East and particularly in Iraq." Military involvement in foreign affairs has been a recurring theme in his speeches -- he mentioned the necessity of intervention in Egypt, Libya and Afghanistan, saying about the latter, "even the slightest impression that the U.S. is looking to get out is devastating." We also found a more specific statement Rubio about Iraq. On Oct. 21, 2011 -- the same day as Rubio's Studio B appearance -- Rubio issued an official statement expressing disappointment in the drawdown Obama had just announced. "I am disappointed that U.S. and Iraqi governments could not agree on a framework that would have allowed several thousand U.S. troops to stay in Iraq to combat Al Qaeda in Iraq and continue the training mission that is vital to Iraq’s future," he said in the statement. "I urge the Administration not to allow today’s announcement to become an obstacle to further negotiations on an enduring security relationship with Iraq. We should remain open to renewing discussions to bring back a robust U.S. force at the Iraqi government’s request that can do counterterrorism and support the Iraqi Security Forces." That seems to be drawn-out politispeak saying, in essence, U.S. forces are leaving too soon. Our ruling The statement from WrongWayRubio.com reads, "Rubio says troops are leaving decade-old war 'too fast'." But the message offered a news story as evidence that doesn’t prove the point. Still, when we looked more broadly at Rubio’s public statements on Iraq, we found the tweeted message did accurately summarize the views he had in September 2011. During a recent foreign policy speech, Rubio didn’t mention Iraq, but we found nothing to indicate Rubio has changed his mind. Given Rubio's stated views -- that U.S. forces should remain in Iraq to provide stability -- we rate the statement True.

pomt-01643	New Glarus Brewing Co.’s Spotted Cow is available only in Wisconsin.	true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/aug/25/mary-burke/mary-burke-says-spotted-cow-beer-available-only-wi/	During a "getting to know you" Q&A with ABC News, Democrat Mary Burke fielded a question that hardly will change the course of Wisconsin’s future. But it did present a dilemma for the would-be governor of the state of beer and brats. The question: Spotted Cow or Summer Shandy? The question forced Burke to choose between two well-known Wisconsin beer makers: New Glarus Brewing Co. and Chippewa Falls-based Leinenkugel’s. She had to choose between a regional craft brewery and a much larger company. And between a slightly cloudy "farmhouse ale" and a wheat beer mixed with lemonade. Burke didn’t equivocate in her reply. "Spotted Cow," she said. "New Glarus is a great brewery and Spotted Cow, you can only get it in Wisconsin and (it's) one of my favorites." Wait, what? We didn’t realize Spotted Cow was so exclusive. And when we asked some beer drinkers — journalists know a few — several seemed surprised that the brew wouldn’t be available beyond the border. "People love when politics and beer collide," noted Milwaukee Journal Sentinel columnist Jim Stingl. So we decided to set aside policy debates (it is late August, after all, and we are planning that Labor Day cookout...) and tap this claim. Is Spotted Cow available only in the Badger State? Breweries and their brews Spotted Cow is the most popular beer produced by New Glarus, the brewery founded in 1993 by Deb and Dan Carey in the village of the same name in south central Wisconsin. New Glarus has enjoyed rapid growth, including a $21 million expansion, and then another $11 million addition. But compared to the Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Co., New Glarus is tiny. Last year, New Glarus sold 146,000 barrels, making it the 17th largest craft brewery in the nation, said Eric Shepard, executive editor of Beer Marketer’s Insights, a trade publication. Leinenkugel sold almost seven times as much, 975,000 barrels. Also, Leinenkugel is a subsidiary of Chicago-based MillerCoors ,which has breweries in Milwaukee and other locations around the country. New Glarus is privately owned with 27 investors. More important, for Burke’s claim, is where the suds are sold. New Glarus sold beer in Illinois for about six years before making a business decision to pull out in 2003. At the time, the Careys said they were unable to keep up with the demand and wanted to focus only on Wisconsin. In 2010, Deb Carey gave a little more colorful elaboration to the Madison Beer Review, a beer-oriented website. "Brewers call Chicago a whores' market," she said. Carey said New Glarus pulled out because "it didn't want to participate in illegal business practices such as giving away beer to get bars to carry its products." "Everyone has a hand out and everyone wants some cash, (free) beer or a discount," she said in the story. "As far as I'm concerned, it's not worth the graft and hassle." She added: "Small brewers can't afford to pay to play. I really blame the big domestic brewers for creating this mess." In an interview, Carey said that even though the brewery has ramped up production and could reach 250,000 barrels a year, the sales strategy won't change. "I'd be happy to die and not sell beer out of state," she said. "We're going to really drill down and focus on our No. 1 asset, which is (brewmaster) Dan, and make world class beer for our friends in Wisconsin." New Glarus' website highlights the Wisconsin-only status with the prominent message: "Only in Wisconsin." Labels say: "Drink Indigenous" Shepard says New Glarus’ strategy is unique among small brewers. "New Glarus is by far the biggest craft brewer available in a single state," he said in an email. Shandy also a hit Introduced in 2007, Summer Shandy became a huge hit for Leinenkugel. Like Spotted Cow, it’s the company’s top seller. But it’s a lot easier to find a bottle of Shandy. Leinie’s brews are advertised nationally, including during the NCAA men’s basketball tourney. They’re found in all 50 states. New Glarus does virtually no advertising. Of course, you can find Spotted Cow in fridges around the country, thanks to visitors who snare a case on their way home from Wisconsin, or who use the online gift shop. So let’s drain this one. Our rating Burke chose Spotted Cow as her beer of choice, saying she liked the beer and the fact it was available only in Wisconsin. The brewery made a business decision and stopped out-of-state sales about 11 years ago. And that’s become an important, if not entirely well known, selling point for the brewery ever since. We rate her statement True. Correction: This item originally stated that Summer Shandy was introduced in 2011. The correct year is 2007.

pomt-03927	"What concerns me is there is only two sentences that have been written about minority business."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/feb/22/vincent-fort/statement-stadium-minority-businesses-short-info/	The Atlanta Falcons may not have made it to the Super Bowl this year. But their future is potentially brighter than ever. Team owner Arthur Blank* is pushing for a new $1 billion retractable-roof stadium to be built in downtown Atlanta in time for the 2017 NFL season. The Georgia World Congress Center Authority -- which owns the Georgia Dome, where the Falcons currently play, and would own the new stadium -- agreed to a framework for a deal in a nonbinding term sheet. That term sheet will provide the foundation for more negotiations later on any binding agreement between the GWCCA and the Falcons. Left to be decided is who pays for the project. The latest funding plan has the Falcons contributing most of the money for construction, along with an upfront public contribution of $200 million paid through bonds issued by Atlanta’s economic development agency. The bonds would be backed with hotel-motel tax money. While those negotiations continue, state Sen. Vincent Fort , D-Atlanta, questioned another part of the project: minority business participation. "What concerns me is there is only two sentences (in the term sheet) that have been written about minority business," Fort said in a Twitter post earlier this month. We wondered whether Fort’s comments about the 24-page document were correct and what this meant for the project. The term sheet for the stadium project is available on the Georgia World Congress Center website. On page five of the term sheet under a category titled "Additional Considerations," the first of four bulleted items addresses minority businesses. "The Falcons and GWCCA will adopt a M/WBE participation program to be included in design and construction contract requirements pursuant to all applicable and/or customary governmental M/WBE requirements or guidelines." The one-sentence item is three lines long, so Fort is mostly correct on the simple logistics of the statement. But he appears to have a larger concern. The federal government requires state and local governments to implement the federal disadvantaged business enterprise program if they receive federal money for transportation projects. The program is meant to level the playing field for businesses that are disadvantaged because of income or other factors when competing for federal dollars. Many state and local governments also establish their own programs for disadvantaged or minority and women-owned businesses in sectors outside transportation, and they set goals for contracts awarded to those businesses. PolitiFact Georgia submitted questions to the GWCCA about disadvantaged business participation in the stadium project. In a detailed response, the authority’s chief operating officer said that records on that information did not exist. But the details are almost sure to be outlined in the final contract before any work is done, said Lloyd Atkins, a consultant in the minority business development office of the University of Georgia’s Small Business Development Center. "These minority and disadvantaged business participation goals are usually established early on because if not framed in the legal parameters of a contract there is no incentive to reach the goals," Atkins said. With the proposed stadium’s probable public-private partnership, a lot of the push for minority participation will be "political will," Atkins said, with adherence to any goals set possibly monitored by the city of Atlanta’s contract compliance office. (PolitiFact Georgia asked that office about any involvement in the project but received no response.) Since Fort’s tweet and subsequent comments to PolitiFact Georgia, some members of the Atlanta City Council this week have lobbied for about 30 percent of the stadium work to be completed by minority contractors. Falcons executives said there will be an "equal opportunity employment commitment" at every stage of the project. The GWCCA’s administrative policies and procedures for procurement of supplies, equipment, goods and contractuals services states: "It is the Authority’s policy to affirmatively encourage and solicit participation with respect to purchases of goods and services by qualified business enterprises to include disadvantage business enterprise (W/MBE) Women and Minority Business Enterprise." Although the Falcons stadium term sheet is one very early step in the process, Fort said the brevity of the statement did not bode well for the participation of minority businesses in the project. "In a state with such a sorry history of using African-American vendors, I was not comfortable with ‘a wink-and-a-nod, trust me approach,’ " Fort said. Fort pointed to last year’s audit of the Georgia Department of Transportation’s disadvantaged business enterprise program. That audit -- publicized during the campaign for a regional transportation sales tax -- found that the state agency had fallen below its targets for awarding contracts to minority and/or women-owned businesses that met the federal definition of disadvantaged. Between 2009 and June 2011, the Transportation Department awarded eligible firms owned by African-Americans just 2.4 percent of its contracts even though those firms make up 14.1 percent of all companies available to perform construction and engineering work. Women owned-businesses received 8.4 percent of the work, and Hispanic-owned firms received 1.1 percent. After the audit, the Georgia Department of Transportation increased its existing targets for awarding contracts to minority and women-owned disadvantaged firms. And Fort used the numbers as part of his campaign against the regional transportation sales tax. When the Georgia Dome was built in the early 1990s and opened in 1992, disadvantaged businesses accounted for 20.7 percent of the contracts, valued at $36.8 million. The total value of construction related contracts on the Dome was $177.8 million, according to information provided by the GWCCA. Removing two sole-source contracts from the available construction work increased the disadvantaged business participation to 23.6 percent. Under the federal definition, white, male-owned businesses can qualify as disadvantaged if they meet certain criteria including personal net worth of the business owner. Fort said the current term sheet that lays out nonbinding terms approved for the new stadium contains only two lines dealing with minority business participation. He uses this brief mention as a reason to be leery of the state’s promise to carry out minority participation promises. A simple look at the term sheet shows that Fort’s statement is correct. But the explanation doesn’t stop there. Already City Council members are pushing for specific minority business participation goals, and whatever goals are set are likely to be included in the final contract before any construction work has begun. Because the details are not yet complete, it is impossible to make inferences on what the goals would be. Fort’s statement is partially accurate but needs a lot additional information. We rate his statement Half True. *Arthur Blank is on the board of directors of Cox Enterprises, whose media holdings include The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

pomt-10296	Obama plans "a tax increase for everyone earning more than $42,000 a year."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/12/john-mccain/obamas-tax-plan-hits-200000-and-up/	A snarky Web ad from Sen. John McCain calls Sen. Barack Obama "The One" and shows his supporters saying things like "Hot chicks dig Obama." "We know he doesn't have much experience and isn't ready to lead, but that doesn't mean he isn't dreamy," jibes an off-screen narrator. Of most interest to us, though, was the ad's claim of what Obama supporters — his "fan club" — will get. "The perks are amazing, like a tax increase for everyone earning more than $42,000 a year," the narrator says, as a 1040 form from the Internal Revenue Service slides across the screen. Text flashes by briefly, then spins around 360 degrees as it fades away, saying, "Obama voted to raise taxes on everyone making more than $42,000." McCain has made similar statements before, saying Obama voted to raise taxes on people making more than $42,000 a year. We rated that statement Barely True . The McCain campaign's evidence for its charges are Obama's votes on budget resolutions. A kind of blueprint for the federal budget, a budget resolution sets targets for committees that write legislation on taxes and spending. Obama joined Democrats on what were largely party-line votes expressing the desire to roll back the Bush tax cuts in order to fund popular programs. The resolution envisions tax cuts rescinded on people making about $42,000 and higher. But voting for a budget resolution is quite different from voting for a tax increase. Budget resolutions are nonbinding, don't have the force of law and don't include precise details on taxes or spending. They're different from legislation that raises or lowers tax rates. In the case of the McCain ad, we're more concerned with the voiceover that says, "The perks are amazing, like a tax increase for everyone earning more than $42,000 a year." That seems designed to make the average viewer think that Obama wants to raise taxes on people making that amount, which isn't true. Obama wants to increase taxes by rolling back the Bush tax cuts on people making more than $200,000 if single or $250,000 if married filing jointly. What the ad implies is a major distortion that seems intent on confusing people about what Obama's policies are. When McCain's ads talked about tax-related votes, we found the statement Barely True . In another instance, he made claims about Democrats raising taxes by $500-million through a budget resolution, a claim we found False . But the new Web ad pushes the envelope too far when the narrator says "a tax increase for everyone earning more than $42,000 a year." It's a gross distortion of Obama's proposals to say they would raise taxes on "everyone" who earns that much, and we rate McCain's claim False.

pomt-05312	Says Josh Mandel opposed federal loans to the auto industry.	false	/ohio/statements/2012/may/18/sherrod-brown/sherrod-brown-campaign-says-josh-mandel-opposes-au/	For all the heat Josh Mandel has taken in this space for things he has said, the Republican state treasurer and U.S. Senate hopeful earns an equal amount of grief for what he won’t say. Mandel often refuses to offer clear opinions on key issues before Congress, be it the Violence Against Women Act or a bill to keep interest rates from doubling on student loans. He says he won’t "cast imaginary votes." His opponents, namely those supporting Democratic incumbent Sherrod Brown, say he doesn’t want to be pinned down on topics important to voters. So PolitiFact Ohio was surprised recently when Brown’s campaign began asserting that Mandel would have voted against the federal loans to rescue automakers Chrysler and General Motors. Brown dialed up the criticism Monday prior to a Mandel event near a GM plant in Lordstown. A headline on a news release labeled Mandel as "anti-auto rescue." In the release, Friends of Sherrod Brown spokeswoman Sadie Weiner said Mandel "would have voted ‘no’ on the auto rescue despite the fact that it saved Ohio jobs and put middle-class families back to work." The claim caught PolitiFact Ohio’s attention, given Mandel’s trademark stealth. Had we missed a policy stand? After considerable research and many discussions with both campaigns, we are not convinced. Brown has been painting his opponent as anti-auto bailout since at least March, when Mandel told The Vindicator, Youngstown’s daily newspaper, that he was developing a plan "to rescue the auto industry." To those who thought the industry already had been rescued by the government loans to Chrysler and GM, Mandel’s statement was a head-scratcher. "I’m not saying the bailout didn’t work," Mandel told the paper. But he also said he "respectfully disagreed" that it saved the U.S. auto industry. Nowhere in the story is he quoted as saying he would have voted against the loans as a senator. Nevertheless, Mandel’s opponents pounced. Citing The Vindicator story in late March, the Ohio Democratic Party bashed Mandel in a news release that, among other gripes, stated he "would have voted to let the auto industry die." The state party works closely with Brown’s campaign -- so closely that Justin Barasky, the Brown campaign’s communications director and a former party spokesman responded to our questions about the statement at the time. Barasky referred PolitiFact Ohio to a Toledo Free Press article from March 14 that appeared under the headline "County Democrats criticize Mandel for opposing auto bailout." Barasky also pointed us to a statement from U.S. Sen. Jim DeMint, a South Carolina conservative who cited Mandel’s support of a "ban on government bailouts" when endorsing him in June 2011. But in the weeks that followed our initial questions, we found no evidence that Mandel himself had ever confirmed he would have voted against the auto bailout. Meanwhile, both the Brown campaign and the Ohio Democratic Party continued with this line of attack. Mandel could have made it easy on us by simply taking a position -- yea or nay. But true to form, he declined. Furthermore, his campaign communications director, Travis Considine, was adamant that our research was accurate: Mandel had not taken a public stance on the loans. We followed up with both campaigns last week and again this week as Mandel traveled to the heart of Ohio’s car-manufacturing belt. Barasky emailed us a clip of video footage he said comes from a February meeting with the Tea Party Express near Cincinnati. "Your United States senator, Sherrod Brown, voted for the Wall Street bank bailout, the largest bailout of Wall Street banks in the history of the United States of America," Mandel says from behind a podium in the video. "If I were there, I would have voted against it." Here’s where it gets tricky. The Wall Street bailout is encapsulated by the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, a measure Congress passed in October 2008. After the Senate failed to reach a deal on a separate bailout for automakers, President George W. Bush, nearing the end of his administration, allocated TARP funds to Chrysler and GM. President Barack Obama allocated additional TARP funds to the two companies in 2009. It is important to note, though, that the Senate, unlike the House of Representatives, never held an up-or-down vote on a standalone auto bailout. Brown’s official support for the rescue plan came when he cast a procedural vote to quickly move on a bill that would have given the automakers emergency loans. The motion failed. Brown also voted for TARP, but at the time no TARP money had been reserved for Chrysler or GM. Barasky argues that Mandel has the benefit of hindsight, and that by declaring he would have voted against the bank bailout, he also is declaring he would have voted against the auto bailout. When Mandel was in Lordstown this week, a reporter for the Youngstown Business Journal asked about this very conflict. Did Mandel oppose the allocation of TARP funds to the automakers? Mandel did not answer the question directly. "When I talk to Democrats, Republicans and independents throughout the Mahoning Valley, I have not come across anyone who supports bailing out Wall Street banks," he said. "I agree with Democrats, Republicans and independents in the Mahoning Valley that it’s dead wrong to bail out the Wall Street banks with our tax dollars." So where does all of this put the Brown campaign’s statement on the Truth-O-Meter? The senator’s re-election team said Mandel "would have voted ‘no’ on the auto rescue." Mandel doesn’t help himself by refusing to take a clear position. A voter who read his comments in The Vindicator would be hard-pressed to determine where he stands on the auto bailout. He indicated he did not think the measure was perfect, but he stopped short of speaking against it. But PolitiFact Ohio puts the burden of proof on the speaker. And the Brown campaign was unable to show us anything in which Mandel definitively stated he would have voted against rescuing the auto industry. By virtue of voting against TARP, a position Mandel confirms he would have taken, he would have voted against a bill that eventually benefited the auto industry. Of course in these hypotheticals, Mandel wouldn’t have known that at the time, so it is intellectually dishonest to write him off as anti-auto rescue. Maybe Mandel will enlighten voters one day with his thoughts on the loans to Chrysler and GM. But for the moment, Brown’s campaign is putting words in Mandel’s mouth and pushing a deceiving line of attack. On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates False.

pomt-03651	The Milwaukee County Board approved a reform package by a 15-3 vote, "meaning Board Supervisors’ salaries will be cut by 20 percent" and "the Board’s budget will be cut by 50 percent."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/may/01/marina-dimitrijevic/dimitrijevic-said-board-vote-pay-budget-accomplish/	Trying to sidetrack state legislation that seeks deep cuts in their pay and budget, Milwaukee County Board supervisors took matters into their own hands. The board voted to approve a multi-pronged reform package, "meaning Board Supervisors’ salaries will be cut by 20 percent, staff will be cut by 50 percent and the Board’s budget will be cut by 50 percent," said an April 25, 2013 County Board news release that extensively quoted Chairwoman Marina Dimitrijevic. So, since the measure passed on a 15-3 vote, that means salaries and the budget will be cut, right? Maybe not. While Dimitrijevic said the board had "accomplished meaningful reform," Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele -- who backs a fast-moving state Assembly bill that would clip the County Board’s wings -- raised doubts about the significance of the vote. As Abele mulls whether to veto the County Board action, we decided to take a closer look. Some background The state bill, backed by key Milwaukee civic and business leaders, seeks to limit the authority, role and budget of the board. Critics say the board has blocked or slowed changes to county operations that were strained by the 2002 pension scandal and other problems. Fourteen of 18 County Board members oppose the state bill, and have decried the state legislation as meddling into local affairs that would harm checks and balances. The state bill would trump the County Board’s action on spending. It is set for votes in the Assembly on May 8, 2013 and Senate on May 14, 2013. It was authored by state Rep. Joe Sanfelippo, R-West Allis, a former member of the Milwaukee County Board. Republican Gov. Scott Walker, a former Milwaukee County executive, has expressed support for the measure. The state bill would reduce supervisors’ pay by about 50 percent, to $24,000, and drop the board’s budget by two-thirds. It also seeks to make clear that Abele and future county executives have more control over operations. The pay cut, however, needs voter approval in a referendum that would be held in 2014. Supervisor pay was last raised in 2001, shortly before the pension scandal that rocked county government. Pay had peaked at $52,227, but supervisors and Walker agreed to reduce it to $50,679 in 2004, where it still stands. The board resolution The text of the county resolution that was approved by the board states that it seeks to "reduce County Board Supervisor salaries by 20 percent, from approximately $50,679 to $40,543, and the Chairperson’s from $71,412 to $57,130, beginning with the term commencing April 18, 2016." Any future pay increases would require a two-thirds vote of the board and be limited to the rate of inflation. Additionally, supervisors’ salaries could not exceed those of state legislators. The resolution also says the County Board will submit a 2014 budget request that cuts spending 50 percent, including cutting the number of staff positions in half. Future budget increases would require a two-thirds vote. So, the chairwoman has the numbers right in the County Board news release she shepherded. But this is not a done deal, as the blunt language in the news release states. To take effect, changes in compensation policy and County Board procedures must be enshrined in county ordinances. So, to make good on its resolution, the board would have to approve the ordinances at some future point. The text of the resolution makes it clear that more steps remain, stating the board "hereby pledges" to reduce the salaries and "will submit" a 50 percent budget reduction. The resolution directs County Board staff to draft the necessary ordinance changes "as soon as practicable." Bottom line, the board promised reform, in writing, putting it on the record in a way that would be difficult politically to back away from. But the measure itself did not accomplish the changes. We asked Dimitrijevic why a resolution, not an ordinance, was put up for a vote. She said the board wanted to make sure the changes are done correctly. That might only take a week or so, she said. If Abele signs the resolution approved by the board, or the board overrides an Abele veto of the resolution, "we’ll be ready to roll on it," she said. Dimitrijevic said the board intends to approve the cuts even if the state law is unexpectedly derailed or slowed. "We’re going ahead with this plan no matter what," Dimitrijevic said. It’s worth noting that even an ordinance change is not set in stone. The board could repeal an ordinance change, just as it could decline to adopt an ordinance changing its pay even though it has pledged to do so in a resolution. Sanfelippo cites that reality, and the board’s failure to vote on formal ordinance changes, as arguments for using state law to try to cut the pay and budget. A state law would prevent the board from changing its mind down the road, he said. He noted that drafts of his bill (AB-85) have been circulating since January 2013. "They had time," Sanfelippo said. Our rating A news release overseen by Dimitrijevic after 15 of 18 supervisors adopted reforms she championed said the "meaning" of the action was that "Supervisors’ salaries will be cut by 20 percent" and "the Board’s budget will be cut by 50 percent." The claim accurately conveys the intent of the resolution, but goes too far in leaving the impression the cuts were actually adopted by the board. It leaves out the key fact that the resolutions have no binding effect on their own. On their own they don’t "accomplish" the cuts. We rate this Half True.

pomt-12965	"Our university campuses by federal law do not check the immigration status of their students just as our public schools don’t."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2016/dec/28/lloyd-doggett/lloyd-doggett-says-federal-law-universities-dont-c/	A Democrat said Texas universities rightly don’t check on whether students are living in the country with legal authorization--in accord with federal law. U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Austin, whose district stretches south into San Antonio, was asked in a December 2016 interview with Austin's CBS Austin to talk about whether certain college students should be worried amid threats to take away federal funding from so-called "sanctuary campuses," presumably a reference to colleges and universities whose leaders indicate no desire to help immigration authorities pursue students who lack legal U.S. residency. Doggett replied by initially calling "sanctuary campuses" a misnomer. The former Texas Supreme Court justice went on: "Our university campuses by federal law do not check the immigration status of their students, just as our public schools don’t. And that’s the right thing to do. There is a Supreme Court decision about the right to public education." Doggett added that if there’s a dangerous person on campus, law enforcement should honor any arrest warrant from immigration authorities to assure safety. A 1982 Supreme Court ruling held U.S. children to be entitled to kindergarten through grade 12 public schooling regardless of legal residency status. Yet that decision wasn't reflecting on university access. So Doggett’s statement made us wonder how federal law keeps state universities from checking the immigration status of students. There isn’t such a law, it appears. And when we asked which law Doggett was thinking of, Doggett’s House chief of staff, Michael Mucchetti, said by email: "His point is that current federal law doesn’t even require universities to check." Mucchetti earlier noted that on Dec. 7, 2016, Denise Trauth, president of Texas State University, told faculty, staff and students in a Twitter post: "The university, following current law, does not and will not report undocumented immigrants to authorities." We didn't read Trauth's statement as her saying the university doesn’t check the immigration statuses of students. Beyond that, our requests that a university spokesman, Matt Flores, specify the law Trauth was talking about didn’t immediately draw a reply. Board that oversees Texas colleges, universities Next, we asked the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, which oversees colleges and universities statewide, about whether Texas universities check the citizenship status of students. In reply, Kelly Carper Polden emailed us a November 2016 agency overview of state laws that enable Texas residents lacking legal U.S. residency--either through citizenship or permanent resident/"green card" status--to attend public colleges at in-state tuition rates rather than more costly nonresident rates, provided the students have lived in Texas with a parent, guardian or conservator for 36 months up to high school graduation. ‘Affidavit’ students in Texas The overview gives the impression that Texas universities routinely tally students who lack legal U.S. residency. That is, the publication says that each benefiting student must complete an affidavit stating his or her intent to apply for permanent resident status in the U.S. as soon as he/she meets federal eligibility requirements. Also, the publication states, each "public institution of higher education is responsible for acquiring and maintaining, indefinitely or until the student becomes a Permanent Resident of the U.S., signed affidavits completed by non-U.S. citizens seeking Texas resident status for in-state tuition purposes. "In addition, Coordinating Board rules require institutions to remind affidavit students each year of their obligation to apply for Permanent Resident status as soon as they are eligible to do so," the overview states. "The same rules require the institutions to refer students to the appropriate federal agency for instructions on how to achieve Permanent Resident status," the overview says. We’ve reported several times before on Texas "affidavit" students. Then-Gov. Rick Perry’s approval of the 2001 legislation authorizing such college admissions drew fire when he ran for president in 2012. The 2016 overview states that in fiscal 2015, through August 2015, the state’s 24,982 "affidavit students" included 17,384 students in public community, technical and state colleges; 7,580 students in public universities; and 18 students in public health-related institutions, costing an estimated $23.42 million in state appropriations while the affidavit students paid $58.3 million in tuition and fees, the overview states. Subsequently, web searches led us to a sample universal application for students seeking to enroll at Texas A&M University in fall 2017 that asks if the applicant is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident or if the applicant fulfills state residency requirements related to fulfilling "affidavit" status. Also, to our inquiry, Polder pointed us to the state’s Core Residency Questions form last updated by the coordinating board in 2011; the form asks an applicant to attest to her or his U.S. citizenship or other residency status and includes this provision: "I authorize the college/university to verify the information I have provided." National perspective Nationally in November 2016, more than 500 college and university presidents called for preserving and even expanding Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a 2012 initiative by President Barack Obama that enabled young immigrants brought to the U.S. as children to go to college and seek work despite lacking legal authorization to live in the country. After spotting that call on the Pomona College website, we asked the college’s dean of students, Miriam Feldblum, who’s also an immigration scholar, if Doggett was right about federal law and universities not checking the immigration status of students. By phone, Feldblum said that’s certainly not so for international students, who must have visas to live and study in the U.S., and, she said, no federal law prohibits institutions from checking the immigration status of students. Regardless, she said, public colleges and universities focus for tuition purposes on whether applicants are state residents. Feldblum also stressed that federal privacy laws bar colleges and universities from unilaterally sharing the immigration status of a student absent the student’s consent or a compelling factor such as a subpoena. "Right now, campuses are not sharing this information with anybody," Feldblum said. "We have no obligation to do so." Doggett aide: Claim mischaracterized We filled in Mucchetti on our finding no federal law forbidding universities from checking a student’s residency status. We also shared the state-published overview for Texas "affidavit" students. By email, Mucchetti suggested we were mischaracterizing the congressman’s statement. Doggett "did not say that any federal law prohibits or bars universities from checking status. He was saying that educational institutions are not required by federal law to check status—that like our public schools, public universities, in accord with federal law, do not check," Mucchetti wrote. Our ruling Doggett said: "Our university campuses by federal law do not check the immigration status of their students." We see an element of truth here in that colleges and universities, like public schools, don’t act as immigration enforcement agents. But we didn't spot nor did Doggett identify a federal law that bars or excuses universities from checking the immigration statuses of students. Meantime, a state law leads public Texas institutions to tally "affidavit" students, each of whom has declared a lack of legal U.S. residency. Also, each student-applicant to those colleges and universities must answer questions about citizenship and legal residency and agree to have information verified.

pomt-15273	"The economy, by every metric, is better than when I came into office."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/28/barack-obama/barack-obama-tells-jon-stewart-economy-every-metri/	During his farewell visit to Jon Stewart’s Daily Show, President Barack Obama took a bit of a victory lap. At one point in the extended interview posted online, Obama said, "Here's the thing I can say, Jon. I can say this unequivocally: The VA is better now than when I came into office; government works better than when I came into office; the economy, by every metric, is better than when I came into office." It was the last of those claims -- that "the economy, by every metric, is better than when I came into office" -- that caught our attention. That’s a pretty strong statement. Is it correct? Statistics that support Obama’s claim Three common economic statistics that are widely considered important are gross domestic product, unemployment rate and employment level. And looking just at these three measurements, Obama has a strong record in office. • Gross domestic product per capita. Inflation adjusted GDP per capita -- that is, all economic activity in the United States divided by the number of U.S. residents -- has increased from $47,002 in 2009 to $54,630 in 2014, an increase of 16 percent since Obama took office. • Unemployment rate. In January 2009, the unemployment rate was 7.8 percent. After peaking at 10 percent in October 2009, the rate fell to 5.3 percent by June 2015. That’s a drop in unemployment of almost one-third since Obama’s inauguration, and it’s been mirrored in drops among African-Americans and Latinos. • Employment level. In January 2009, total nonfarm employment in the United States stood just shy of 134 million. By February 2010, employment had fallen to 129.6 million, but by June 2015 it had rebounded to 141.8 million. That’s an increase in jobs of almost 6 percent from the start of Obama’s term. Where things haven’t gone so well for Obama While Obama has some statistics to point to, it is wrong to say that "the economy, by every metric, is better than when I came into office." We found several important measurements that went in the wrong direction during Obama’s tenure. • Real median weekly earnings. Between the first quarter of 2009 and the first quarter of 2015, inflation-adjusted weekly earnings for full-time wage and salary workers fell from $348 to $344, a decline of about 1 percent. Comparing the second quarter of 2009 and the second quarter of 2015, weekly earnings fell from $342 to $337, a decline of about 1.4 percent. • Median income. Inflation-adjusted median household income, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, fell from $54,059 in 2009 to $51,939 in 2013 -- a decline of about 4 percent. (Depending on how you adjust these raw numbers for taxes and in-kind income, inflation-adjusted income per person may have gone up a bit rather than shrinking.) • Percent of people in poverty. The data show that 13.2 percent of Americans were living in poverty in March 2009. By March 2014, that percentage had risen to 14.5 percent. That was down slightly from what it was in the previous three years, but not enough to match the 2009 level. • Median weeks unemployed. In January 2009, the median number of weeks an unemployed person was unemployed was 10.7. By June 2015, that number had risen to 11.3 weeks. (The peak of 25.2 weeks came in June 2010.) • Civilian labor force participation rate. This is the percentage of people either working or looking for work, divided by the civilian, noninstitutionalized population. In January 2009, this stood at 65.7 percent, but by June 2015, it had fallen to 62.6 percent. The caution here is that this statistic has been affected by the increasing rate of retirements due to the aging of the Baby Boomers. However, most economists say that the weak recovery has played at least some role in this decline. • Number of people on food stamps. The number of recipients has risen from 33.5 million in 2009 to 46.5 million in 2014, an increase of 39 percent. What is hard to say is how much comes from expanded accessibility rules and how much comes from rising economic need. The White House argues that Obama deserves credit for achieving an economic recovery "sustainably." "We’ve had growth surge while also shedding debt and building a more sustainable foundation," said White House spokesman Eric Schultz. "We’re growing faster and safer." Our ruling Obama said, "The economy, by every metric, is better than when I came into office." That claim is too sweeping. Certain measures of wages and income, the poverty rate and the duration of unemployment are all worse now than they were when Obama "came into office." The statement contains an element of truth but ignores facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-09877	"All private healthcare plans must conform to government rules to participate in a Healthcare Exchange."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/30/chain-email/health-care-exchange-governments-way-regulating-in/	It may be the longest chain e-mail we've ever received. A page-by-page analysis of the House health care bill argues that reform will end the health care system as we know it: "Page 29: Admission: your health care will be rationed! ... Page 42: The 'Health Choices Commissioner' will decide health benefits for you. You will have no choice. ... Page 50: All non-US citizens, illegal or not, will be provided with free health care services." Most of the e-mail's claims are wrong, and you can read our extended analysis to find out why. But one of the claims is actually true: "All private healthcare plans must conform to government rules to participate in a Healthcare Exchange." To explain this one, we will start with an explanation of the overall bill, which was unveiled July 14, 2009. The bill envisions that everyone will be required to have health insurance. People who get health insurance through work satisfy this requirement right off the bat. People who don't get insurance through work or other groups will go to the health care exchange; it's designed to help people who have to go off on their own to buy health insurance, and for small businesses with few employees. The reason for the exchange is that the government wants to regulate insurers to make sure that health plans clearly explain what they offer, can't refuse people for pre-existing conditions, and must offer basic levels of service. "This is designed to protect consumers from plans that have outrageous cost-sharing or really limited benefits," said Jennifer Tolbert, an independent health care analyst at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan foundation that studies health care reform. Tolbert has read and analyzed all the major health proposals, including those of the Republicans, and the foundation provides point-by-point analyses of the plans on its Web site. The exchange is meant to ensure that people are "actually getting coverage and not a junk policy," Tolbert added. We should note that the e-mail says this rule is listed on page 72 of the health care bill. We found that the requirement that insurance companies must conform is also presented much earlier in the bill. We spotted an earlier reference on page 15, Section 101. That doesn't change the fact that the assertion is correct. We've ruled that many of the e-mail's other claims are wrong, but not this one. The e-mail said, "All private healthcare plans must conform to government rules to participate in a Healthcare Exchange." We rule that True.

pomt-01129	"The President has decided to move forward with executive actions on immigration that he has said on numerous occasions that he didn’t have the constitutional power to take."	true	/virginia/statements/2014/dec/29/bob-goodlatte/goodlatte-says-obama-has-flip-flopped-his-power-or/	U.S. Rep. Bob Goodlatte says President Barack Obama exceeded his authority last month when he bypassed Congress and unilaterally extended legal status to millions of immigrants. The evidence lies in the words of the president himself, Goodlatte said. "It’s both perplexing and alarming that the president has decided to move forward with executive actions on immigration that he has said on numerous occasions that he didn’t have the constitutional power to take," Goodlatte, R-6th, said in a news release. Obama announced on Nov. 20 that he will delay deportation of immigrants who have lived illegally in the U.S. for more than five years but have children who are citizens or have greencards. If applicants pass background checks and pay a fee, they can qualify for a work permit and avoid deportation for three years at a time. More than 4 million people could qualify for the program, which will be open for applications this spring. Obama also expanded a program he began by executive action in June 2012 to halt the deportation of students -- known as "dreamers" who were brought to the U.S. as children when their parents entered the country illegally. Obama’s action came after the House of Representatives failed to approve a comprehensive immigration reform bill that had cleared the Senate. We asked Goodlatte’s office to back his claim that Obama had repeatedly said he lacked the power to order sweeping immigration reform. Beth Breeding, Goodlatte’s spokeswoman, pointed us to a Nov. 19 news release by House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, citing 22 instances of Obama saying he couldn’t act unilaterally on immigration. Some of the items on the list don’t affect immigration at all, but are general statements that Obama made as a candidate about cutting down on executive orders. But there are some comments on the speaker’s list get to the heart of Goodlatte’s statement. Let’s take a look: March 28, 2011 During a town hall meeting at the Bell Multicultural High School in Washington, Obama was asked if he could issue an executive order to stop deportation of undocumented high school students. The president dismissed the idea. Obama said, "With respect to the notion that I can just suspend deportations through executive orders, that’s just not the case, because there are laws on the books that Congress has passed -- and I know that everybody here at Bell is studying hard so you know that we’ve got three branches of government. Congress passes the law. The executive branch’s job is to enforce and implement those laws. And then the judiciary has to interpret the laws. "There are enough laws on the books that are very clear in terms of how we enforce our immigration system that for me to, simply through executive order, ignore these constitutional mandates would not conform with my appropriate role as president. That does not mean, though, that we can’t make decisions, for example, to emphasize enforcement on those who’ve engaged in criminal activity." Jan. 30. 2013 During an interview with Univision, a Spanish-language television network, Obama was asked if he would consider a moratorium on deportations of non-criminal immigrants. The president said, "Well, I think it is important to remind everybody that, as I said I think previously, I’m not a king. I am the head of the executive branch of government. I’m required to follow the law. And that’s what we’ve done. But what I’ve also said is, let’s make sure that we’re applying the law in a way that takes into account people’s humanity. That’s the reason that we’ve moved forward on deferred action. Within the confines of the law we said, we have some discretion in terms of how we apply this law. The same is true with respect to the kinds of the length of time that people have to spend outside of the country when their spouses are already here, for example." Feb. 14, 2013 Obama was asked During a Google+ Hangout, by a woman named Jackie, if he would be willing to take executive action on immigration to ensure "families are not split apart." Obama said, "Well look Jackie, this is something I’ve struggled with throughout my presidency. The problem is that I’m the president of the United States. I’m not the emperor of the United States. My job is to execute laws that are passed and Congress, right now, has not changed what I consider to be a broken immigration system and what that means is we have certain obligations to enforce the laws that are in place, even if we think in many cases the results may be tragic. "And what we have been able to do is to make sure that we are focusing our enforcement resources on criminals as opposed to someone who is just here and trying to work and look after their families. What we have tried to do is administratively reduce the burdens and hardships on families being separated, and what we’ve done is obviously passed a deferred action which made sure the dreamers -- young people who were brought here and think of themselves as American -- are American except for their papers, that they are not deported. Having said all that, we’ve kind of stretched our administrative flexibility as much as we can. That’s why making sure we get comprehensive immigration reform done is so important." Sept. 17, 2013 Obama was interviewed by Jose Diaz-Balart, anchor for Noticias Telemundo. The broadcaster asked the president if he would "consider unilaterally freezing deportations for the parents of deferred action kids." Obama said, "Here’s the problem that I have, Jose, and I’ve said this consistently. My job in the executive branch is supposed to be to carry out the laws that are passed. Congress has said here’s the law when it comes to those who are undocumented, and they allocate a whole bunch of money for enforcement, and what I have been able to do is make to a legal argument, that I think is absolutely right, that given the resources that we have, we can’t do everything that Congress has asked us to do. "What we can do is then carve out the DREAM Act folks, saying young people who have basically grown up here are Americans,that we should welcome. We not going to have them grow up under a cloud, under a shadow. But if we start broadening that, then essentially I would be ignoring the law in a way that I feel would be very difficult to defend legally." Obama’s order does not specifically protect parents of dreamers from deportation. But many of them, if they can pass background checks and pay a fee, will still be able to delay their deportation under general provisions of the executive action. Still, in this interview, Obama casts doubt that his executive powers to shield people from deportation extends beyond the dreamers. In a Nov. 18 press conference, White House spokesman Josh Earnest was asked about the president’s 2013 comments that broadening protections beyond the dreamers "would be very difficult to defend legally." "Since this interview aired, the president did direct the attorney general and the secretary of Homeland Security to conduct a review of the law to determine what, if any, authority he could use to try to fix some of the problems that House Republicans have refused to address," Earnest said. In announcing his executive actions, Obama said he was well within his legal authority to take them. Twenty-five states -- but not Virginia -- have joined a suit challenging the president’s power to issue the immigration order. Our ruling Goodlatte said, "The President has decided to move forward with executive actions on immigration that he has said on numerous occasions that he didn’t have the constitutional power to take." The record supports Goodlatte. We rate his statement True.	None	Bob Goodlatte	None	None	None	2014-12-29T11:47:04	2014-11-21	['None']
pomt-01705	Top U.S. intelligence officials have told "every member of Congress, including the president, we’re about to be attacked in a serious way because (of) the threat emanating from Syria and Iraq."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/10/lindsey-graham/graham-us-intelligence-leaders-predicting-isis-att/	President Barack Obama’s decision to launch limited, open-ended air strikes against Islamic militant positions in Iraq has drawn criticism that the situation demands a more muscular military response. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a member of the Armed Services Committee, described the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, the force that has quickly occupied a large section of Iraq, as "an existential threat" to the United States. "Do you really want to let America be attacked?" Graham asked on Fox News Sunday. "What is going on in Washington when the FBI director, when the head of national intelligence, the CIA, the Homeland Security secretary, tells every member of Congress, including the president, we’re about to be attacked in a serious way because (of) the threat emanating from Syria and Iraq? "If he does not go on the offensive against ISIS, ISIL, whatever you want to call these guys, they are coming here. This is not just about Baghdad. This is not just about Syria. It is about our homeland," Graham said. In this fact-check, we examine whether each of those high ranking officials have said "we’re about to be attacked in a serious way because (of) the threat emanating from Syria and Iraq." Graham’s office sent us several quotations from three of the officials the senator listed. FBI director James Comey On Jan. 9, 2014, FBI Director James Comey said: "My concern is that people can go to Syria, develop new relationships, learn new techniques and become far more dangerous, and then flow back." This quotation appears in an ABC News report. We found three news reports of Comey answering journalists’ questions about the threat posed by Americans who joined the fight against Syria’s Bashar al-Assad and have returned to the United States. The New York Times reported on the high priority the FBI has put on tracking people returning from Syria. "It’s something we are intensely focused on," Comey said. In an article later in January, the Los Angeles Times repeated that Comey said the FBI was putting a "tremendous amount of time and effort into identifying those who go to Syria." The article summarized Comey’s assessment this way: "The threat ‘keeps me up at night.’ He (Comey) sees the region as a ‘launching ground’ for potential Sept. 11-style mass-casualty attacks in this country." These stories emerged almost exactly at the time that ISIS began its assault in Iraq and had yet to show how effective it could be. Comey saw a threat from returning combatants, but a larger-scale attack was more a future risk than an immediate danger. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson Graham’s office pointed to comments from Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson from Feb. 7, 2014. "We are very focused on foreign fighters heading to Syria," Johnson said. "Based on our work and the work of our international partners, we know individuals from the U.S., Canada and Europe are traveling to Syria to fight in the conflict. At the same time, extremists are actively trying to recruit Westerners, indoctrinate them, and see them return to their home countries with an extremist mission. … Syria has become a matter of homeland security." Johnson made these comments during a speech at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington. Johnson spoke of the evolving terrorist threat and, like Comey, specifically mentioned the citizens who come back from fighting in Syria. But Johnson went further and talked about the people who "self-radicalize" and never train with foreign fighters. "In many respects, this is the terrorist threat to the homeland, illustrated last year by the Boston Marathon bombing, that I worry about the most," Johnson said. "It may be the hardest to detect; involves independent actors living within our midst, with easy access to things that, in the wrong hands, become tools of mass violence." Johnson was describing less an imminent threat from ISIS and more a chronic risk posed by radical Islam. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper Graham’s office pointed to comments from James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, on Jan. 29, 2104. He spoke of "the sectarian war in Syria, its attraction as a growing center of radical extremism and the potential threat this poses to the homeland." On Feb. 11, 2014, Clapper talked about forces in Syria: "The three most effective are the Al-Nusrah Front, Aura al Sham and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, or ISIL, as it’s known, whose numbers total more than 20,000. Complicating this further are the 7,500-plus foreign fighters from some 50 countries who have gravitated to Syria. Among them are a small group of AfPak (Afghanistan-Pakistan) al-Qaida veterans who have aspirations for external attack in Europe, if not the homeland itself." The first quote comes from a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing where Clapper, like Comey and Johnson, was talking mainly about the conflict in Syria serving as a breeding ground for trained militants, some of whom might return to the United States. Clapper said, "We should be very concerned about this." In February, Clapper and CIA Director John Brennan testified before the House Select Intelligence Committee. Clapper, as the quotation from Graham’s office said, talked about Syria as a magnet for radical fighters. Clapper did not necessarily tie ISIS to attacks on America itself, but for a subgroup of al-Qaida veterans, he spoke of their "aspirations" to launch an operation "in Europe, if not the homeland itself." When Brennan was asked whether training camps in the region presented a real threat to America, he said they did. When asked if groups like ISIS might need to "prove themselves" with an operation outside of Syria, Brennan said, "It's a near-term concern, as well as a long-term concern." Michael O’Hanlon, a foreign policy analyst at the Brookings Institution, an academic center in Washington, said Graham has a point that ISIS should be taken seriously, but O’Hanlon offers a caveat. "The ISIS threat is very grave, but attacks are not — and in fact, virtually never are — inevitable," O’Hanlon said. "We have a host of defense mechanisms and shouldn't be fatalistic about protecting ourselves." Our ruling Graham said that four top administration officials have said "we’re about to be attacked in a serious way because (of) the threat emanating from Syria and Iraq." Graham’s office sent quotations from three of the four. While each of them voiced strong concern about attacks on American soil, the role of ISIS was more indirect and less immediate than Graham would have us believe. The government officials spoke of the conflict in Syria as a training ground. Johnson, the Homeland Security director, also cast the Syrian civil war as a cause that could inspire "lone wolf" terrorists in the mode of the Boston Marathon bombers. The government officials talked about the "aspirations" of some al-Qaida veterans and the steps they were taking to track the people who posed the greatest risk. They spoke of taking the threat seriously, but their words fell well short of Grahams’ phrase that,"we’re about to be attacked in a serious way." We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-06439	The stimulus created "zero jobs."	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2011/oct/21/national-republican-senatorial-committee/national-republican-senatorial-committee-ad-says-s/	As President Barack Obama toured Virginia last week touting his jobs plan, Republicans countered that his previous effort -- the stimulus -- did not create a single job. The National Republican Senatorial Committee posted a web ad inking Obama and former Gov. Tim Kaine, who served as the president’s hand-picked chairman of the Democratic National Committee from 2009 until early this year. Kaine resigned the post when he announced he would run for the U.S. Senate next year. The 31-second NRSC ad has footage of Kaine strongly endorsing the president and predicting the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 "will save or create 2.4 million jobs." Three people appear in quick order on the screen, saying, "Zero jobs, zero jobs, zero jobs were created." Zilch? We thought we’d look into this familiar claim once again, noting that Republican George Allen, Kaine’s likely opponent in next year’s U.S. Senate race, is featuring the ad on his campaign web site and sent out a tweet heralding it. Chris Bond, press secretary for the NRSC, told us the zero-jobs claim is not about the stimulus. "The part of the ad you’re referring to clearly shows news clips about unemployment reports" by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, he said in an email. But we think anyone seeing the ad would conclude the zero-jobs claim is tied to the stimulus. The commercial makes no apparent reference to unemployment reports. It clearly mentions the stimulus, however. PolitiFact is no stranger to claims that the Recovery Act was a complete dud. In June, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-7th, received a False rating on his claim that the stimulus "failed to get people back to work." His office argued it was a broad statement that the Recovery Act failed to improve the economy, not a claim that no one benefited from it. Echoing Cantor, the NRSC later in June put out a news release saying the stimulus "failed to create jobs," and that also received a False rating from PolitiFact. Texas Gov. Rick Perry said during a Republican presidential debate Sept. 12, 2011, that the stimulus "created zero jobs." He earned a Pants on Fire from our national PolitiFact colleagues. There was also smoke in the air after U.S. Sen. Scott Brown, R-Mass., said in February 2010 that the stimulus "didn’t create one new job," and after Florida Republican Rick Scott claimed in September 2010 while successfully campaigning for governor that the stimulus "has not created one private sector job." The zero-job claim is not credible for a simple reason: The stimulus did put people to work. Virginia’s public schools and higher education institutions have reported the Recovery Act allowed them to create 996 jobs through the end of June 2011 and save 6,042 positions, according to Charles Pyle, communications director for the state Department of Education. The White House has posted on its stimulus website a listing of jobs funded by the stimulus, breaking it down by state and congressional district. For the quarter that ended June 30, the nation had reported 545,262 full-time equivalent jobs funded by the Recovery Act -- including 11,604 in Virginia.. The president’s Council of Economic Advisers, in a report released in March, estimated that between 2.5 million and 3.6 million jobs were created or saved by the stimulus through the fourth quarter of 2010. Separately, the council’s report cited four independent analyses by the Congressional Budget Office and three private economic analysis companies. Here’s what the groups found: • CBO: Between 1.3 million and 3.6 million jobs saved or created. • IHS/Global Insight: 2.45 million jobs saved or created. • Macroeconomic Advisers: 2.3 million jobs saved or created. • Moody’s Economy.com: 2.5 million jobs saved or created. Our ruling: The stimulus may not have been the success everyone hoped for, but there’s an abundance of evidence it did create jobs and saved many more. Just look at the figures from the Virginia Department of Education. The NRSC added its name to a list of Republican candidates who claim the the stimulus created "zero jobs." When we asked for proof, the campaign organization provided none. Instead, a spokesman said the ad "clearly" referred to federal unemployment reports -- not the Recovery Act. We don't buy that explanation; the commercial is undoubtedly focused on the stimulus. Not one job anywhere? It’s a ridiculous claim and we rate it, once again, Pants on Fire.

pomt-06727	"We've had 11,000 attempts to amend the Constitution since 1789."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/30/xavier-becerra/11000-attempts-amend-us-constitution-only-27-amend/	At a press briefing about the debt limit negotiations, Rep. Xavier Becerra, D-Calif., criticized a Republican push for a balanced budget amendment. He said Congress should not be hasty about amending the Constitution and noted that only a tiny number of amendments ultimately pass. "We’ve had 11,000 attempts to amend the Constitution since 1789. Twenty-seven amendments have been passed, 10 of them in one shot with the Bill of Rights. And so, we’re now hearing that Republicans may want two, three days before they plunge us into the economic abyss, propose the eleven-thousand and first constitutional amendment so that in less than three days we pass that when it’s taken over 230 years to pass 27 out of the 11,000 that were proposed," Rep. Becerra said, adding, "That’s the height of ridicule." Becerra was later named to the "super committee" that is developing a plan to comply with the budget cuts required by the debt ceiling vote. Before we get to the numbers, it’s worth reviewing the process for amending the U.S. Constitution. Amendments can be proposed two ways: in Congress or by a national convention assembled at the request of the two-thirds of the states legislatures. The national convention approach has been attempted twice but has never been successful. So the successful amendments have all originated in Congress. And according to a congressional tally, Becerra is just about right on target: Congress has considered "approximately 11,372 amendments" from 1789 through December 31, 2008, the most recent tally available, according to the Statistics and Lists section of the United States Senate website. Why is it "approximately" 11,372? The site says that's because of a number of factors, including inadequate indexing of legislation in the early years of Congress. Of those 11,372 proposed amendments, only 27 have been approved by Congress and ratified by the states. Why such a low success rate? Senate Historian Donald Ritchie told us that amending the Constitution is "an extremely complicated process" and an amendment "essentially only gets adopted when there’s a broad national consensus on the issue." University of Pennsylvania law professor Kermit Roosevelt agreed, noting that "the founders wanted the bar set high because they believed that most issues should be left to the ordinary political process. A constitutional amendment takes an issue away from the normal process of democratic politics, quite likely forever. So it makes sense to require an extraordinary consensus to resolve it permanently." Most proposals aren’t inspired by a broad national consensus, however. The motivation for introducing a constitutional amendment is often political. "Every time the Supreme Court makes a ruling some member of Congress doesn’t like, someone pushes for a constitutional amendment on the matter," Ritchie told us. For example, the day after the Supreme Court ruled flag burning to be protected speech in 1989, U.S. Rep. Michael Bilirakis, R-Fla., introduced an amendment outlawing desecration of the flag. Amendments to ban flag burning have been introduced in every session of Congress since, spanning more than two decades. Many amendments are introduced many times. An amendment defining marriage as between one man and one woman has been introduced numerous times in the last decade, including four times in a single session of Congress. Some are introduced many times but with variations. Following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, members of Congress introduced amendments that would provide for the continuity of Congress in the event of a sudden mass vacancy in the Capitol. The amendments varied on what constituted that "mass vacancy" and how replacement lawmakers would be chosen. None of the amendments passed. Back to Becerra. He was correct that only a tiny percentage of amendments ultimately pass and are ratified. He said 11,000; the official count puts the number at approximately 11,372. That's close enough to earn a True.	None	Xavier Becerra	None	None	None	2011-08-30T11:38:21	2011-07-29	['None']
pomt-11598	The immigration visa lottery "randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of American people."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/30/donald-trump/donald-trump-leaves-out-facts-claim-about-visa-lot/	President Donald Trump in his State of the Union address outlined changes he’s seeking to immigration laws, including the end to the diversity visa lottery program. Trump said his administration presented a four-pillar proposal "that should be supported by both parties as a fair compromise." "The third pillar ends the visa lottery — a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of American people," Trump said Jan. 30. Trump mischaracterized the program. He failed to note that individuals who come to the United States through the lottery program must be vetted by the United States and also must meet certain education and work criteria. The White House did not respond to our request for comment on the record. Here are the facts. Applicants must meet education or work experience criteria The visa lottery program was established in 1990 to diversify the United States’ immigrant population. The lottery began in 1995 and selects applicants from countries with low immigration levels during the previous five years. Diversity visas are currently capped at 50,000 per fiscal year. It’s worth noting that entries chosen in the lottery do not automatically get a visa, they only become eligible to apply for it. Applicants must meet education or work experience requirements, according to the U.S. State Department and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services: • At least a high school education or its equivalent, defined as successful completion of a 12-year course of formal elementary and secondary education; or • Two years of work experience within the past five years in an occupation that requires at least two years of training or experience to perform. Potential immigrants must undergo vetting by U.S. government Visa lottery applicants can include a spouse and children in their application. While only the applicant has to meet the education and work requirement, all potential travelers must be thoroughly vetted by the United States. Applicants who pass a vetting process are awarded the diversity visa. Information reviewed in the vetting process includes passport, police and medical records, photographs, English translations of documents, and education or work experience credentials. "No visa can be issued unless all concerns raised by the screening are fully resolved. As part of this screening process, information that might suggest an individual is a potential threat is shared with all appropriate U.S. government agencies," a State Department official previously told us. "National security is our top priority when adjudicating visa applications," the agency added. Our ruling Trump said the visa lottery program "randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of our people." While lottery applicants are randomly selected, they must meet education and work experience requirements. They must also be vetted by the United States government before being allowed to come to the United States. We rate Trump’s claim False.

pomt-02858	There were "$2 billion in earmarks in fiscal year 2012."	false	/oregon/statements/2013/nov/15/karl-king/were-there-2-billion-earmarks-fiscal-year-2012-pol/	Political controversies come and go faster than fashion trends. While government shutdowns, sequestration and the debt ceiling are hogging the political catwalk right now, it seems like only yesterday that battles over budgetary earmarks were all the rage. You remember earmarks: provisions in spending bills that let individual members of Congress direct money to specific projects or entities in their districts. The zenith of attention for earmarks came in 2010. That’s when Republican opposition to the practice helped the GOP retake control of the House of Representatives. Leaders quickly won approval of a moratorium on earmarks. Not to be outdone, Senate Democrats approved a moratorium in that chamber, too. Then, like wide ties, earmarks faded from public view. So it caught our attention recently when Karl King, who is mounting an independent bid to unseat Oregon Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley, homed in on earmarks on the "issues" page of his website. King, a licensed massage therapist from Redmond, singled out two issues he wants to focus on. The first involves individual privacy rights. The second addresses the federal budget, which he said should be cut. Among the areas that should be sheared, King said, are "the 2 billion dollars in earmarks in fiscal year 2012." Did that year’s federal budget, despite moratoriums approved by both chambers of Congress really contain $2 billion in earmarks? PolitiFact Oregon decided to check. We emailed King and asked where he got the $2 billion figure. He responded quickly, saying a review of his notes didn’t include any source for the number. He then said in a followup email he would change the figure on his website to $3.3 billion, a number he got from the Pig Book, a publication put out since 1991 by Citizens Against Government Waste, a private, nonpartisan Washington, D.C., budget watchdog group. We called Leslie Paige, Citizens Against Government Waste’s vice president for policy and communications. She defended the $3.3 billion figure but said no Pig Book charting annual pork-barrel spending has been issued since 2012 because the moratoriums have made it so difficult to trace what went where. "The process is now very opaque and the money going through the system is almost impossible to track," Paige said. "Simply put, we lack the manpower to check it all out." Paige’s group arrived at the $3.3 billion figure by matching appropriations in "earmark-free" bills to spending clearly identified as earmarks in bills passed before the ban. A $50 million earmark for the National Guard Counterdrug Program in the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2012, she said, corresponds to nine earmarks totaling $22.9 million in the same act approved two years before. She acknowledged that "the vast majority of earmarks have dried up" since Congress banned the practice but added that, according to her group’s definition, some earmarks continue. So what qualifies as an earmark? Anything satisfying at least two of the follow criteria, she said: Requested by only one chamber of Congress; not specifically authorized; not competitively awarded; not requested by the president; greatly exceeds the president’s budget request; not subject to congressional hearings; and serves only a local or special interest. The bottom line, Paige said, is that Congress has figured out ways to stuff earmarks into spending by calling them different names. "We ended up creating our own proprietary definition," she said. "We got sick and tired of the idea that one man’s pork is another’s constituent services." The federal Office of Management and Budget, meanwhile, defines earmarks as "funds provided by Congress for projects or programs where the congressional direction (in bill or report language) circumvents Executive Branch merit-based or competitive allocation processes, or specifies the location or recipient, or otherwise curtails the ability of the Executive Branch to manage critical aspects of the funds allocation process." OMB’s website lists all appropriation earmarks up to 2010. It stops there with a note that the earmark ban effectively halted the practice. But the benchmark is the definition used by the Congressional Research Service, Congress’ public policy research arm. Its definition is the most widely used and acknowledged, according to Oregon congressional representatives of both parties contacted by PolitiFact Oregon. According to the agency’s website, earmarks are "Provisions associated with legislation (appropriations or general legislation) that specify certain congressional spending priorities or in revenue bills that apply to a very limited number of individuals or entities. Earmarks may appear in either the legislative text or report language (committee reports accompanying reported bills and joint explanatory statement accompanying a conference report)." That matches parts of Paige’s group’s definition, but doesn’t mesh with others. It says nothing about "greatly exceeding the president’s budget request," "not being requested by the president," or requests "by only one chamber of Congress." Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, another D.C.-based watchdog group, agreed that different groups have varying definitions for what constitutes an earmark. "But on balance," he said, "there is a moratorium. That’s not a false statement." All agree that the moratorium is having an effect. Before the ban, Washington County could count on getting about $2 million in federal money every two years for targeted projects, said Dennis Mulvihill, who recently retired after a long stint as the county’s government relations manager. "But since those bans were put in place, it’s been pretty dry," he said. "Maybe other states are squeezing something out, but nothing’s coming to Oregon." So what about King’s claim that Congress chalked up $2 billion in earmarks in 2012? Andrew Malcolm, a spokesman for Rep. Greg Walden, R-Oregon, said it didn’t happen. "After winning the majority in 2010, House Republicans kept their promise and adopted a ban on all earmarks," he said in an emailed statement. "That earmark ban remains in place today." Of course, as a member of the party that pressed for the earmark moratorium in the House, Walden has a vested interest in saying earmarks are no longer used. But he gets support in his statement from Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Oregon. DeFazio, who said earmarks can be a useful way for Congress to give direction in how federal money is spent, said in an emailed statement, "The so-called earmarks ban has shifted a tremendous amount of discretion to the executive branch and its political appointees." He notes a shift in spending authority, in other words, but acknowledges the earmark ban is in effect and working. News outlets have tackled the question of earmarks and whether, in varying forms, they continue to exist even after the congressional ban. If a large appropriations bill ultimately directs millions to a dam and locks project in Kentucky, for instance, is that an earmark? It may not fit the definitions of the Office of Management and Budget or the Congressional Research Service, but groups such as Citizens Against Government Waste might say yes. Because of that, if we were strictly rating the figure in the Pig Book, we might find an element of truth. But because King cited "2 billion dollars in earmarks in fiscal year 2012" -- not the $3.3 billion -- and because he offered with no sourcing for his figure, we find his statement False.

pomt-02183	"I am the only senator who turned down the state pension plan for part-time legislators."	true	/georgia/statements/2014/apr/28/don-balfour/balfour-declined-legislative-pension/	State Sen. Don Balfour, R-Snellville stood trial and was found not guilty late last year on allegations that he swindled taxpayers by submitting erroneous state expense reports. Now this year, the entire General Assembly is up for re-election, and Balfour has three challengers, including two in the fast-approaching May 20 Republican primary. Balfour recently sent out a campaign flier to voters talking about the trial, his acquittal and a judge ‘s ruling that he be reimbursed by the state for his $156,000 defense. The flier also says he rejected the chance to lawfully collect tens of thousands of dollars from the state, and hence, taxpayers. "I am the only senator who turned down the state pension plan for part-time legislators," Balfour states in the flier. He goes on to say "this saved taxpayers over $160,000 I could have claimed." This is red meat for the scribes at PolitiFact Georgia. Fact check here we come. We reached out to officials at the state Employee Retirement System. They confirmed that they had supplied Balfour’s office with information that he was the only one of Georgia’s 56 senators who had declined membership in the Legislative Retirement System. Georgia’s part-time lawmakers currently earn $17,341 a year and are eligible for a daily per diem of $173 to cover travel costs when they are on legislative business, which includes committee meetings and the 40-day annual General Assembly session. They also are eligible to receive a lifetime benefit of $792 a month at age 62 if they have been making contributions to the legislative pension plan for at least 22 years, according to the ERS. That adds up to $9,504 a year, or about $160,000 after 16.8 years by ERS calculations. Balfour, who was first elected to the state Senate in 1992, says in the flier that, on principle, he never signed up for the pension plan. "Nobody in the private sector gets a guaranteed retirement plan for a part-time job and neither should a state legislator," he states. Others under the Gold Dome clearly don’t share that philosophy. Of 236 state legislators -- 56 senators and 180 House members -- 223 were active in the Legislative Retirement System as of June 30, 2013, said Jim Potvin, the ERS’ executive director. One other senator isn’t taking the pension, though that wasn’t discovered until Balfour’s office had been told he was the only one, ERS staff said. As of June, 259 retired legislators and beneficiaries were collectively receiving $1.8 million a year, or about $587 month each, Potvin said. Benefits are calculated based on a legislator’s age, years of service and a benefit formula factor, $36 a year. It’s not all free money. Legislators contribute 3.75 percent of their monthly salary, and the state provides a 4.75 percent match, Potvin said. Legislators are vested after eight years of service, he said. Balfour, a Waffle House executive, has three challengers in this year’s elections. In his own party, he faces former Gwinnett County Commissioner Mike Beaudreau and former Lawrenceville City Councilman P.K. Martin. If he survives the primary, he’ll go up against Democrat Timothy Andrew Swiney, a real estate broker from Lawrenceville, in the November general election. In summary: The state Employee Retirement System told Balfour’s office that he was the only one of Georgia’s 56 state senators who has refused a state pension. He repeated that statement in a flier that he sent out to constitutes. When we contacted ERS officials last week, they told us they had "since discovered there is another senator who is not a member of LRS." Our ruling: Balfour’s campaign flier says he is the only senator who has not signed up for a legislative pension. He made the claim based on information his office had been given by the state Employee Retirement System. We rate Balfour’s statement as True.

pomt-07490	Says the federal government borrows "almost $60 billion per week."	false	/georgia/statements/2011/apr/13/paul-broun/us-rep-broun-said-weekly-debt-grows-60-billion/	The political carnival otherwise known as the federal budget debate was chock-full of partisan fun and games. For instance, congressional leaders played chicken for weeks over the amount of cuts. Republicans wanted about $61 billion, while Democrats hoped for $33 billion. They reached a deal for roughly $39 billion in cuts late Friday night, about an hour before a federal shutdown. They also played the blame game. Democrats and Republicans spent the days before the shutdown trying to convince the public that whatever happened, it was the other party’s fault. In an April 1 speech before Congress, U.S. Rep. Paul Broun played pin the blame on the donkey. "It’s pitiful that the Democrats have wasted so much time stalling over these minimal cuts in their own self-interest while our country is financially bleeding to death," the Athens Republican said. "We should be focused on trying to revive our economy rather than bickering about $61 billion dollars when we already borrow almost $60 billion per week." The federal government borrows $60 billion per week? PolitiFact Georgia decided to take a closer look. Broun was one of four members of the 13-member Georgia congressional delegation who rejected Friday’s budget compromise. Republican Rep. Tom Graves of Ranger and Democratic Reps. John Lewis of Atlanta and Hank Johnson of Lithonia joined him. Republican dissenters thought the cuts didn’t go far enough. Democrats thought they were too deep. Neither camp had much impact. The House voted 348-70 to accept the deal. More information about Broun’s spending figures were close at hand. A pair of deficit hawks, U.S. Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Mark Warner, D-Va., barnstormed Atlanta on Monday to explain why Congress needs to cut the deficit soon. PolitiFact Georgia marked the occasion by fact checking an op-ed they co-wrote that claimed "An average of $4 billion is added to the national debt" every day. We rated the claim Mostly True. This is what we determined: There are two kinds of federal debt and interest -- the debt held by the public and the total debt. About $9.65 trillion of the $14.25 trillion debt is held by the public. The rest is money the government loans to itself. Both measures of the federal debt are valid. Between the end of 2009 and April 6, 2011, the public debt had risen by an average of slightly more than $4 billion a day. This year, the debt has risen by about $2.6 billion a day. The total debt’s average daily increase for that same time period was about $4.3 billion. In 2011, the total debt has risen by about $2.45 billion a day. These figures show Broun’s claim that the government borrows "$60 billion" each week misses the mark. The debt held by the public grew on average about $28 billion per week between the end of 2009 and April 6, 2011. The total debt grew by about $30.1 billion. This year, the weekly growth has declined to $17.15 billion or $21 billion, depending on which debt measure you use. Neither comes close to $60 billion. We asked Broun’s office about the discrepancy. Broun spokeswoman Meredith Griffanti said he must have misspoke. Broun meant to say that the federal government borrows nearly $60 billion every two weeks. Since Broun got his numbers wrong, we rate his claim False.	None	Paul Broun	None	None	None	2011-04-13T06:00:00	2011-04-01	['None']
pomt-01380	Says Jeb Bush -- not Charlie Crist -- signed legislation that let Duke Energy collect money for nuclear projects.	true	/florida/statements/2014/oct/15/charlie-crist/crist-says-jeb-bush-signed-law-letting-duke-energy/	While Fangate was the talk of Wednesday’s gubernatorial debate, there were other moments, too -- like when Charlie Crist slammed the door on Gov. Rick Scott’s accusations that Crist was the one who let utility companies charge customers for unbuilt power plants. "Charlie signed legislation that allowed companies like Duke (Energy) to pass on costs for power plants that were never built," Scott said during a discussion of energy policy. Crist cut his Republican opponent off immediately. "That’s not true. That was Jeb Bush," he said to applause from the crowd in Davie. This claim has come up before, when the Republican Party of Florida ran a campaign commercial that said Crist "made it easier for Duke to take your money." We rated that False. What Crist said at the debate is accurate. History lesson This attack centers on the Crystal River nuclear plant and a planned nuclear plant in Levy County that was never built. Duke Energy (which merged with Progress Energy in 2012) fumbled 2009 repairs to the existing Crystal River facility and planned to break ground on the Levy project, but never did. Because of a 2006 energy bill, SB 888, both Duke and Progress were allowed to charge Florida’s 1.7 million Duke customers an "advance fee" to pay for those plants before any work got under way. In 2013, Duke decided to shut down the Crystal River plant rather than fixing it, leaving a bill of about $1.7 billion from repair work and other expenses. The company also spent about $1.5 billion on the Levy County project, then canceled it, demanding more and more advance fee money. The Florida Public Service Commission ruled in an October 2013 settlement that customers would be on the hook for $3.2 billion in expenses, while insurers would pay $835 million and shareholders would pay the rest. A year later, under pressure from consumers and environmentalists, the PSC ordered Duke Energy Florida to credit $54 million back to ratepayers. Now that we know how the story ended, let’s return to SB 888, which is the legislation that allowed companies to charge advance fees to begin with. The bill passed the Legislature overwhelmingly and was signed on June 19, 2006, by then-Gov. Jeb Bush. That was well before Crist -- who was attorney general at the time -- was serving in the governor’s office. He ran and won that fall, taking office in January 2007. Scott said at the debate that people should go to one of his websites, FactsForFlorida.com, to see the bill Crist signed, so we looked. But just as the state GOP cited in its commercial, the bill on that site was HB 7135, a 2008 amendment to the original law allowing the advance fee. The site Scott mentioned read, "2008: Charlie Crist signed a law expanding the Nuclear Cost Recovery Act, allowing utilities to pass on the costs of transmission lines and other construction to consumers." However, Duke Energy never received any advance fee money as a result of this particular amendment, since there were no transmission lines or construction costs involved for either project. Crystal River was an existing plant, and the Levy project never got out of the planning stages. "The problem with that argument is that, to the best of our knowledge, Duke never recovered any money related to transmission lines," said Susan Glickman, Florida director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, a nonprofit advocate for sustainable energy policy. "Even though Gov. Crist signed the omnibus energy bill, the provision Scott refers to never played a role in the costs now being borne by Duke Energy customers." There’s a different company that stands to benefit from the amendment Crist signed, however: Juno Beach-based Florida Power & Light Co., with 4.4 million customers in Florida. That’s because in May, Scott and his Cabinet approved FPL plans to erect 88 miles of giant transmission lines for two new reactors in Miami-Dade’s Turkey Point facility, over the protests of residents and local officials. Our ruling Crist said former Gov. Bush signed legislation allowing utility companies to charge customers for power plants that were never built. Scott and Republicans point to a 2008 amendment that Crist signed into law, but this amendment never led to any charging of customers for either facility at issue -- the Crystal River plant or the uncompleted Levy County plant. Instead, the operative law was signed in 2006, when Bush -- Crist’s Republican predecessor -- was governor. And ironically, it’s Scott whose decision has allowed a utility company to potentially benefit from the measure Crist signed. We rate Crist’s statement True.

pomt-00539	"Even our nuclear arsenal doesn't work. It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old. They don't know if it worked."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/18/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-our-nuclear-arsenal-doesnt-work/	Donald Trump’s presidential announcement speech touched on topics ranging from the economy and trade to foreign policy and the military. One of the criticisms Trump aimed at the Obama White House during his speech was for its handling of the nation’s nuclear arsenal. "Our enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the way, and we as a country are getting weaker," Trump said on June 16, 2015. "Even our nuclear arsenal doesn't work. It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old. They don't know if it worked. … Boy, does that send signals to (Russian president Vladimir) Putin" that "they don't know what they're doing." We wondered how much truth there was to his claim, so we took a closer look. We found two distinct problems with what he said. (Trump's campaign did not respond to inquiries for this article.) Trump conflates two separate issues -- personnel and equipment In recent years, there has been significant attention given to a series of problems within the military command structure charged with handling nuclear material. In August 2007, a B-52 bomber was carrying 12 soon-to-be-retired cruise missiles. They were all supposed to be fitted with dummy warheads, but six of the missiles were discovered to be carrying actual warheads -- something that could have proven disastrous. Then, in 2013 and 2014, the Air Force gave low inspection scores to intercontinental ballistic missile crews at Minot Air Force Base and Malmstrom Air Force Base. Also in 2013, two high-ranking officials with key positions in the nuclear chain of command -- Vice Adm. Timothy Giardina and Maj. Gen. Michael Carey -- were disciplined. Giardina was suspended after an investigation into the use of counterfeit gambling chips, while Carey was reassigned after an investigation into "personal misbehavior." Finally, in 2014, officers at Malmstrom Air Force Base were implicated in a drug investigation, which in turn led to the discovery that 34 officers may have cheated on proficiency exams. These were widely considered to be serious issues, and they have spawned a number of official oversight actions. But the lapses do not involve "equipment" malfunctions, as Trump put it. Rather, they are problems in command and control -- and while significant, they don’t suggest that the nation’s entire arsenal "doesn't work," experts say. "The Air Force nuclear enterprise has been bedeviled recently by troubling lapses and poor morale, which led to two major reviews of the Pentagon nuclear mission," said Kingston Reif, director for disarmament and threat reduction policy at the Arms Control Association. "But this is a far cry from saying, ‘Our nuclear arsenal doesn’t work.’ " A well-funded modernization program is under way Some aspects of the nuclear program are indeed old. The youngest nuclear-armed B-52 bombers, for instance, are roughly 50 years old. While much of this aging equipment is perfectly operational, some nuclear-weapons components, such as warheads, do deteriorate with age. Still, that doesn’t mean the nation’s nuclear weapons stockpile "doesn’t work," experts said. For starters, the Pentagon and the Energy Department -- which share different responsibilities for nuclear weapons -- are required by law to certify the safety, security, and effectiveness of the arsenal on an annual basis. "Over and over, the nuclear weapons laboratories, the Air Force, the Navy, and the Secretary of Defense have certified that the nuclear arsenal does work," said Matthew Bunn, a nuclear specialist at the Harvard Kennedy School. These reviews, Reif said, are sufficiently thorough to give comfort to policymakers. "No U.S. military commander would trade the U.S. nuclear arsenal for Russia’s," he said. In addition, the United States is engaged in a multi-year program to modernize the nation’s nuclear arsenal, including the rebuilding of the Minuteman III system, which launches intercontinental ballistic missiles, and the Trident II submarine-launched missile systems, as well as the refurbishment of nuclear warheads and construction of new and upgraded facilities, such as a uranium processing facility in Oak Ridge, Tenn. "While we haven’t deployed major new strategic systems in some time, we’ve been modernizing the ones we’ve got more or less continuously," Bunn said. This modernization effort will cost roughly $35 billion a year during the next decade, or 5 percent to 6 percent of planned national-defense spending, according to Congressional Budget Office reports released in December 2013 and January 2015. Cumulatively, the bill could reach $1 trillion over the next 30 years. "This is a planned investment unrivaled by any other nuclear power," Reif said. Ultimately, Bunn said, it’s reasonable to have concerns about certain issues, "from fixing up aging crew silos in the ICBM force, to recruiting, retaining, and motivating the right people to operate U.S. nuclear forces, to the enormous cost of replacing the aging U.S. nuclear force." But he added that Trump is "totally wrong -- and irresponsible, if our adversaries believed him -- in saying ‘our nuclear arsenal doesn’t work.’ " Our ruling Trump said that "even our nuclear arsenal doesn't work. It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old. They don't know if it worked." There have been a number of high-profile lapses in the management of the country’s nuclear stockpile in recent years, but those problems have to do with personnel and training. They’re not an indication that the weapons themselves "don’t work" -- which, if it were true, would be a significant problem for the nation’s strategic military position in the world. In reality, the United States has been spending $35 billion a year to upgrade its nuclear stockpile, and officials tasked with certifying the safety and reliability of the current arsenal have consistently given their seal of approval. We rate Trump’s claim False.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2015-06-18T14:42:05	2015-06-16	['None']
pomt-14258	"For the votes that we got, I think we spent, on average, two bucks a pop. Compared to 42 bucks" for incumbent Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/apr/11/chris-larson/chris-larson-says-chris-abele-spent-42-vote-spring/	As the results became clear in the race for Milwaukee County Executive, unsuccessful challenger Chris Larson took the stage and thanked his supporters. Larson, a Democratic state senator from Milwaukee, lost April 5, 2016 to incumbent Chris Abele by a 55 to 44 percent margin. In his concession speech, Larson said his campaign was a success, in part, because it made Abele more responsive and willing to listen to concerns of residents. He then mentioned a key element in the race: money. Abele largely paid for his own campaign, taking in only a handful of contributions. And records showed he spent an estimated $3.5 million on the campaign between July of 2015 and two weeks before Election Day. At that point, he also had $642,618 in cash on hand. "Big money may have won the battle, but they haven't won the war," said Larson. He then offered a calculation to illustrate the spending disparity. "For the votes that we got, I think we spent, on average, two bucks a pop. Compared to 42 bucks from the other guy," Larson said in remarks carried on live television. That’s quite a gap. During the campaign, Larson regularly told audiences that he was being outspent by Abele by 20 to one. But in his concession speech, Larson put an even bigger figure on the gap. Was he right? Doing the math Let’s work some numbers, based on the vote totals and campaign finance reports on file with the Milwaukee County Elections Commission. Abele: Reports show that between July 2015 and March 21, 2016, his campaign spent just over $3.5 million. Unofficial returns from the general election show Abele received 156,524 votes. That comes to $22.36 per vote. (A footnote: Abele’s reports show about $5.6 million in personal loans to his campaign, but some of those loans go back as far as 2010 and his first run for the office. That figure would amount to $35.77 per vote, but we are using the narrower time frame to focus on this election.) Larson: Reports show that in the same pre-election time frame, Larson spent $216,243. Virtually all of that came from individual contributors, although Larson loaned his campaign $10,000 on March 21, 2016. He received 125,292 votes, so he spent about $1.72 per vote. So, it’s clear Larson was outspent by a major amount -- just not the amount he cited. "Our number-crunching showed that Abele spent $24-25 a vote," Larson campaign manager Josh Kilroy said in an email. "In the dim lighting and fraught emotions, I suspect Larson inverted the numbers." Last-minute spending The final reports showing last-minute spending do not have to be filed until July of 2016. So, the final dollar-per-vote number -- on both sides -- will be higher. Would that spending make a difference? A key indication of the final weeks’ spending -- television advertising buys -- can be found in reports filed by local TV stations with the Federal Communications Commission. The Abele campaign spent or planned to spend about $195,000 on 482 television spots in the window from March 21 to the election, according to the reports, which are prepared before the ads aired and subject to revision. If you take the known spending by Abele -- the money already spent plus the final batch of TV ads -- it comes to $3,695,000, or $23.60 per vote. In addition to the TV ads, Abele sent out numerous direct mail fliers. Also, many other payments to staff and consultants, bonuses and bills from vendors come in after the election. The tally would rise to about $26 per vote if Abele spent the full $642,618 in cash on hand -- and didn’t pour any more of money into the race. But there are no indications the spending would end up at $40 per vote, as Larson claimed. And, in any case, just as Larson could only rely on known information in making his claim, we must base our rating on information available at the time. Our rating In conceding defeat, Larson claimed he spent about $2 per vote received while Abele spent $42.

pomt-09947	Sotomayor "ruled against the white firefighter — Ricci and other white firefighters — just on the basis that she thought women and minorities should be given a preference because of their skin color and because of the history of discrimination in the past. The law was totally disregarded."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/28/rush-limbaugh/rush-limbaugh-says-sotomayor-disregarded-law-rule-/	While many Republican leaders have been publicly cautious with their opinions about President Barack Obama's nominee for the Supreme Court, Sonia Sotomayor, radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh has been crystal clear about his opposition. "Do I want her to fail to get on the court? Yes," Limbaugh said on his show on May 26, 2009. "She'd be a disaster on the court." In making his case, Limbaugh cited a Sotomayor ruling that has drawn scrutiny from critics this week. "She ruled against the white firefighter — Ricci and other white firefighters — just on the basis that she thought women and minorities should be given a preference because of their skin color and because of the history of discrimination in the past," Limbaugh said. "The law was totally disregarded." Limbaugh is referring to Ricci vs. DeStefano , a case involving firefighters in New Haven, Conn. A group of mostly white firefighters claimed reverse discrimination after the city threw out the results of promotional exams because white firefighters fared significantly better than black firefighters. Here's what happened. In late 2003, 118 New Haven firefighters took written and oral exams for promotion to the ranks of captain and lieutenant. Among the 41 who took the captain exam (eight of them black), no blacks and at most two Hispanics would have been eligible for promotion to captain. And of the 77 who took the lieutenant exam (19 of them black, 15 Hispanic), the results indicated that no blacks or Hispanics would be promoted to the rank of lieutenant. The New Haven Civil Service Board worried the test may have violated "anti-disparate-impact requirements" of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and that the city would face an employment discrimination lawsuit from nonwhite applicants who were not promoted. So the board decided not to certify the exam results, and no one was promoted. The white firefighters, naturally, were ticked off. One of them, John Ricci, is dyslexic, and studied hard to score highly on one of the exams, only to have it invalidated. Eighteen firefighters, 17 whites and one Hispanic, filed a lawsuit against the city claiming the decision not to certify the exam results "amounted to intentional discrimination" against the white firefighters in favor of black firefighters due to their race and political support for the mayor, John DeStefano. The federal district court judge who heard the case ruled in favor of the city. The firefighters appealed to the 2nd Circuit, the court on which Sotomayor sits. A three-judge panel that included Sotomayor upheld the district court ruling with a one paragraph explanation: "We affirm, substantially for the reasons stated in the thorough, thoughtful, and well-reasoned opinion of the court below. In this case, the Civil Service Board found itself in the unfortunate position of having no good alternatives. We are not unsympathetic to the plaintiffs' expression of frustration. Mr. Ricci, for example, who is dyslexic, made intensive efforts that appear to have resulted in his scoring highly on one of the exams, only to have it invalidated. But it simply does not follow that he has a viable Title VII claim. To the contrary, because the Board, in refusing to validate the exams, was simply trying to fulfill its obligations under Title VII when confronted with test results that had a disproportionate racial impact, its actions were protected." The brevity of that response, and its lack of analysis, rankled one dissenting appeals court judge, Jose Cabranes. "The opinion contains no reference whatsoever to the constitutional claims at the core of this case, and a casual reader of the opinion could be excused for wondering whether a learning disability played at least as much a role in this case as the alleged racial discrimination," Cabranes wrote. "This perfunctory disposition rests uneasily with the weighty issues presented by this appeal." Subsequently, the Supreme Court decided to take up the case, and heard arguments in April. But back to Limbaugh's claim. That Sotomayor ruled against "white firefighter Ricci and other white firefighters" is undisputed. But this is a very complex legal case and Limbaugh misleads when he boils down the ruling by Sotomayor (and two other appeals court judges), saying it was made "just on the basis that she thought women and minorities should be given a preference because of their skin color and because of the history of discrimination in the past. The law was totally disregarded." The ruling by the three-judge panel makes no mention of giving preferential treatment to women or minorities, as Limbaugh suggested. Rather, it upholds a district court decision that the city had the right to throw out a test it felt led to racially disparate results. The first sentence of the panel's statement is also significant. The judges begin by saying they agree with the district court ruling "substantially for the reasons stated in the thorough, thoughtful, and well-reasoned opinion of the (district court)." In other words, without laying out all those opinions, they were essentially incorporating what the district court said. So we took a look at the opinions delivered by District Judge Janet Arterton on Sept. 28, 2006. The first thing we note is that the opinion cites numerous other cases to back up various points. That alone weakens Limbaugh's claim that "the law was totally disregarded." Moreover, Judge Arterton lays out very specific legal reasons for her decision. "Nothing in the record in this case suggests that the City defendants or CSB (Civil Service Board) acted 'because of' discriminatory animus toward plaintiffs or other non-minority applicants for promotion," Arterton wrote. "Rather, they acted based on the following concerns: that the test had a statistically adverse impact on African-American and Hispanic examinees; that promoting off of this list would undermine their goal of diversity in the Fire Department and would fail to develop managerial role models for aspiring firefighters; that it would subject the City to public criticism; and that it would likely subject the City to Title VII lawsuits from minority applicants that, for political reasons, the City did not want to defend." The judge cites several cases which, she wrote, "clearly establish" that a public employer faced with the threat of a lawsuit over a test with racially disparate results does not violate civil rights laws by taking "neutral, albeit race-conscious, actions to avoid such liability." The judge argued the white firefighters could not claim to have been discriminated against because "here, all applicants took the same test, and the result was the same for all because the test results were discarded and nobody was promoted." In siding with the city, the judge wrote that the city's "motivation to avoid making promotions based on a test with a racially disparate impact, even in a political context, does not, as a matter of law, constitute discriminatory intent, and therefore such evidence is insufficient for plaintiffs to prevail on their Title VII claim." We cite some of this not just to make your head hurt, or to make the case that the ruling was correct — that will ultimately be up to the Supreme Court — but to show the complicated legal issues involved, as well as the fact that the district court did, in fact, make reasoned legal arguments and cited numerous legal cases to underpin its decision. In other words, you may not agree with the conclusions, but it's wrong to suggest the judges "totally disregarded" the law. Nor did Sotomayor's panel or the district court ever suggest that the city ought to give preferential treatment to women and minorities. And so we rule Limbaugh's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04088	In 2011, more people were murdered with knives, "hands or feet" or "clubs and hammers" than with any type of rifle.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jan/18/facebook-posts/facebook-post-says-more-people-were-murdered-knive/	Gun-rights advocates have mounted an aggressive social-media campaign to blunt the popularity of the White House’s efforts to advance new restrictions on guns. One reader forwarded us a statistics-heavy Facebook post that echoes others we’ve received. It says, "Facts gun control advocates don’t want you to know. According to the FBI, in 2011, 1,694 were murdered with knives, 726 with hands or feet, 496 with clubs or hammers, 323 with rifles of any type. But Obama wants to ban semi-automatic rifles?" We should first note that there is significant disagreement over what is, or should be, considered "an assault weapon." For instance, even though the Facebook post references Obama’s intention to "ban semi-automatic rifles," California law already includes some types of handguns and shotguns in its definition of "assault weapon." That said, we’ll take a look at the number of deaths caused by rifles. To check the post, we looked at the 2011 edition of the FBI’s annual "Crime in the United States" report. The report breaks down the types of weapons used in murder. These are the statistics for 2011, the most recent year available: Handguns 6,220 Rifles 323 Shotguns 356 Other guns 97 Firearms, type not stated 1,587 Knives or cutting instruments 1,694 Blunt objects (clubs, hammers, etc.) 496 Personal weapons (hands, fists, feet, etc.) 728 The Facebook post and the FBI stats are closely in tune. Except for a minor typo in the Facebook post’s number for deaths by hands, fists or feet, the numbers are accurate. The number cited for rifles was somewhat less precise. While it’s true that the FBI counted 323 murders by rifles, the agency also counted 1,587 murders by an undetermined type of firearm and 97 by "other guns." If gun usage in these two categories followed the same pattern as other gun homicides, that would add another 75 or so murders by rifle, making an estimate for the number of rifle murders about 400, rather than 323. Still, the larger point holds: Murders by knives, blunt objects and body parts each individually outweighed those committed using a rifle. We should note that while the Facebook post’s comparison is accurate as far as it goes, it does ignore the single biggest category of weapons used in murders -- handguns. Handguns were used in 6,220 cases, or 72 percent of all firearm murders in 2011 and slightly under half of all murders using any kind of weapon that year. This caveat illustrates how the selection and framing of statistics can be used to bolster one side or the other in the gun debate. Our ruling The post uses data selectively, ignoring the significant role of handguns in gun violence. But the statistics it mentions are solid. FBI data backs up the Facebook post’s claim that in 2011, more people were murdered with knives, "hands or feet" or "clubs and hammers" than with any type of rifle. We rate the statement True.

pomt-12209	"We have been able to cut New York’s uninsured rate in half since 2013 from 10 percent to 5 percent of our population."	true	/new-york/statements/2017/jul/24/eric-schneiderman/how-has-obamacare-lowered-new-yorks-uninsured-rate/	With Republicans lacking the votes to "repeal and replace" Obamacare, or to even undo major parts of the law without replacing them, Democrats tout President Barack Obama’s signature legislation a success story in New York state. State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman asserted the number of people without health insurance fell by half over the past four years. "Since 2013 we have cut our uninsured in half from 10 percent up to 5 percent of our population," Schneiderman said. The state’s health insurance exchange, NY State of Health, started accepting customers in 2013. States were mandated to either create their own exchanges or participate in one from the federal government. More than 3.6 million people in New York state have enrolled in a health plan through the state exchange since it began, according to the state Department of Health. But is Schneiderman right that the uninsured rate in New York has been cut in half since the exchange began? Data on uninsured New Yorkers According to Centers for Disease Control data, 10.6 percent of New York state’s population did not have health insurance in 2012, the year before the state health exchange was established. By 2015, the uninsured rate was 4.9 percent, but it increased to 5.4 percent in 2016 - still about half the rate before the law. Explaining the decrease Does Obama's Affordable Care Act deserve the credit? Experts we spoke to said the rate dropped because the state health exchange gave people an easier way to compare health plans online, and premiums dropped 53 percent the first year of the exchange. Average premiums have since increased. "It’s really just been an incredible boom for New York state, the Affordable Care Act," said Elisabeth Benjamin, vice president of health initiatives at the Community Serve Society of New York. New York state also opted into an option in Obamacare that provides low-cost health insurance to people who make too much for Medicaid but not enough to buy insurance. More than 665,000 state residents have enrolled in the plan since it first became available in 2015, Benjamin said. New York and Minnesota are the only two states with this option. The state also expanded the income threshold for Medicaid eligibility. That allowed some people to get coverage through Medicaid. Our ruling Schneiderman said "we have been able to cut New York’s uninsured rate in half since 2013 from 10 percent to 5 percent." He’s right on the numbers. The uninsured rate in 2013 was 9.6 percent. The latest data shows it at 5.4 percent in 2016. We rate his claim as True.

pomt-00791	Lawmakers were paid for their off-season efforts to, for the first time, take the lead in drawing borders for two would-be cities.	true	/georgia/statements/2015/apr/07/mary-margaret-oliver/taxpayers-bore-cost-drawing-proposed-cities-border/	A border battle between two would-be cities in north-central DeKalb County took center stage in a lengthy House debate on Day 39 of the 40-day legislative session. Boundary disputes between the proposed cities of Lakeside and Tucker killed cityhood efforts last year. A House subcommittee brokered a compromise in December between Tucker and what was renamed LaVista Hills after the two sides again failed to agree on borders. The subcommittee’s chairman, Rep. Buzz Brockway, R-Lawrenceville, said at the time that the boundaries were "set in stone." But the Senate voted to move about 2,000 people and some commercial property out of Tucker and into LaVista Hills, setting up the tense House debate that saw subcommittee members successfully beat back the altered map. The two chambers eventually struck a deal to split the disputed territory between the two proposed cities. But in that House vote, speaking in the parlance of a floor debate, Rep. Mary Margaret Oliver, D-Decatur, repeated commitments from the subcommittee. "Isn’t it true that we were paid a per diem in December to resolve this dispute, to set this border in stone?" Oliver asked. Traditional response dictates the response: If the lady so states. But what about her underlying point: Taxpayers funded a subcommittee’s work to hammer out borders of proposed cities when advocates couldn’t agree, only to see that public commitment nearly unravel in the waning days of the session. PolitiFact Georgia decided to find out. First, it’s important to understand how state legislators are compensated. The 180 members of the House and 56 members of the Senate earn $17,342 in annual salary for their service. They can also earn $173 a day for expenses such as lodging and meals, or up $6,920 for the annual legislative session. Despite being part-time lawmakers, their obligations don’t end when the gavel bangs to end the session. That’s why members also qualify for that $173 per diem any time in the "off-season" that they must take time off from work and travel for constituent services, to participate in regular committees, such as the busy Transportation Committee, and when serving on a special committee tasked with studying a particular policy area. Oliver was one of five members of the special House subcommittee charged with helping draw borders for the proposed DeKalb cities. The unusual thing about the subcommittee: It was the first time the full House set up such a group to help draw borders for new cities. And the full House agreed to abide by the subcommittee’s decision, as long as both cityhood groups did, too. Records show the subcommittee met Dec. 3 and Dec. 19 before voting during its second session to draw the borders. The deal also allowed the cityhood bills to advance in one year instead of the customary two years. "Our agreement to allow a shortened process means this line is frozen," Brockway told WABE-FM (90.1) about the borders at the time. Representatives from both cityhood efforts agreed at the time to the deal. So, too, did House members. And records with the General Assembly Fiscal Office show the House members of the subcommitee did file for and earn per diems by registering their attendance with Brockway. Brockway and Oliver earned $173 each for the Dec. 3 session, as did state Reps. Barry Fleming, R-Harlem; Mark Hamilton. R-Cumming; and Howard Mosby, D-Atlanta. Per diem was paid again for the attendees of the Dec. 19 meeting: Brockway, Hamilton, Mosby and Oliver. The total per diems paid out for the two meetings, not including any mileage filed at 56 cents per mile, totaled $1,557. "Our work was done in the public, as official work, and I don’t think it’s right to agree to change an act of a full subcommittee being paid to work," Oliver told PolitiFact Georgia after the House vote (but before the final deal). As the last-day deal shows, the two chambers were able to come to an agreement that divvied up the disputed area near Spaghetti Junction. Once the governor signs the bills, about 100,000 people will decide this fall on whether to form one or both cities. The debate about those boundaries nearly killed those votes for the second year in a row. Oliver said that taxpayers paid for lawmakers to work out a deal for both sides. State records back up that claim. We rate Oliver’s statement True.	None	Mary Margaret Oliver	None	None	None	2015-04-07T00:00:00	2015-03-31	['None']
pomt-06630	Says that three of these five Republicans -- Ben Westlund, Rob Patridge, Max Williams, Lane Shetterly, Lynn Lundquist -- later became Democrats.	false	/oregon/statements/2011/sep/17/ted-piccolo/max-williams-rob-patridge-ben-westlund-lynn-lundqu/	The Oregon Republican Party recently voted to strip anti-gay language from its party platform, prompting one popular online blogger to muse that platforms aren’t super relevant. In a follow-up comment, Ted Piccolo, who posts as "I am Coyote," wrote: "You had folks like Ben Westlund, Rob Patridge, Max Williams, Lane Shetterly, Lynn Lundquist all get elected. All of them were opposed to the (social-conservative) portion of the ‘platform.' And guess what? They ended up folding like a lawn chair on the fiscal battles as well. Heck three of them ended up becoming Democrats later." PolitiFact Oregon knows Salem well enough to identify the late Ben Westlund as a former Republican turned independent turned Democrat. But the other four? We were pretty sure they were still firmly in the Republican camp -- and would rather be lawn chairs than give up their GOP affiliation. (OK, we’re not positive on that last part.) Lundquist was Republican Speaker of the Oregon House in 1997. He ran a cattle and mint ranch outside of Powell Butte in Central Oregon. And as of Sept. 15, he was still registered Republican in Crook County. The same goes for Patridge, who serves on the staff of Oregon’s only Republican U.S. representative and is running for district attorney in Jackson County; Williams, who oversees the state Department of Corrections; and Shetterly, a former director of the Department of Land Conservation and Development who now practices law. All three served in the Oregon House, as Republicans. So, what gives? Piccolo owned up to using "a little blog short hand." (PolitiFact Oregon can’t resist pointing this out as a lesson in always checking what you read, especially on the Internet.) He said he is much more careful about language in official blog posts than comments -- but he stands by his assertion that Westlund, Williams and Shetterly are really Democrats. "... Westlund left the party entirely to run as a Democrat, Williams and Shetterly caved so much that they were appointed by and went to work for a Democratic administration. Whether those two changed parties entirely I'm not sure. But the policies they began supporting after they moved on to their appointments in the State government were pretty much anathema to those of the party." Williams said through a spokeswoman that he has been a Republican for as long as he’s been registered to vote. Shetterly said he, too, has stayed one. In any case, Piccolo is not alone in complaining about the GOP credibility of Shetterly, Williams and Patridge. In 2003, the trio defied House GOP leadership to push a revenue raising plan so hairy that legislators were lobbied day and night over the vote and threatened with tough primaries. Williams and Shetterly left to take state jobs offered by then Gov. Ted Kulongoski, a Democrat. Patridge decided against running for re-election. (Lundquist went on to head the Oregon Business Association, which has been slammed by some conservatives for pushing more government spending.) Piccolo was gracious enough to talk to us about a throwaway comment posted online. He acknowledged he could have explained what he meant more fully. Generally, we think people should be able to criticize elected officials and opine freely without worrying about the raters at PolitiFact. But we have to call this one out, if only to set the party record straight. Shetterly and Williams may not be Republicans in Coyote’s eyes, but according to registration records, they remain Republican voters. He could have called them RINOs, Republican in name only, but he chose to call them Democrats -- for him a more derogatory term. We rate the claim False, knowing full well that others would rate this anywhere from True to a Pants on Fire, depending on their political views.

pomt-14972	In Milwaukee County, juveniles arrested for car theft "get sent immediately home, because under the point system in juvenile court" on holding suspects, "a stolen car gets zero points."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/oct/19/edward-flynn/juvenile-car-theft-suspects-milwaukee-county-get-s/	Is it true that when juveniles get arrested for car theft in Milwaukee County, they just get sent home until their case comes up in court? That’s a claim from Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn, whose department is arresting an increasing number of juveniles for auto thefts. Appearing at a public forum at the Marquette University Law School on Aug. 27, 2015, Flynn talked about auto theft in Milwaukee, where his department has jurisdiction. He also alluded to Milwaukee County, since juveniles arrested for crimes are prosecuted in the county Children’s Court. "If they're a juvenile, they get sent immediately home," Flynn stated, "because under the point system in juvenile court, as to whether or not you're going to be held for any period of time, a stolen car counts as zero points." As we’ll see, it’s possible for a juveniles suspected of car theft to be sent home after their arrest, but it’s not at all automatic. Scope of the problem Juveniles are a significant part of the problem in the city. According to statistics provided to us by Milwaukee police: Juveniles made up 39 percent of the suspects arrested for auto theft and auto theft-related crimes in 2014. The 363 juvenile arrests in those cases was twice as many as in 2013. Through the first nine months of 2015, there were 301 juvenile arrests in auto theft and auto-theft related cases, a slightly higher per-month clip than in 2014 Flynn’s evidence Flynn told us he didn’t have direct evidence to back his statement. In an email, his spokesman, Capt. Mark Stanmeyer, wrote: "Chief Flynn's statement is based on information he has heard over the years from a variety of sources, both internal and external to the department, as he works to encourage the stakeholders in the juvenile prosecution, adjudication, and corrections ‘systems’ to take the issue of juvenile auto theft and general offender reform more seriously." Per Milwaukee police policy, officers take all juveniles arrested for auto theft or operating a vehicle without the owner’s consent to the county Juvenile Justice Center, in the Milwaukee suburb of Wauwatosa. That’s because both offenses are felonies. The first decision -- the one Flynn is referring to -- is where the juvenile should stay until making the first appearance in court. Point system In auto theft cases, the arrested juvenile is ordered to appear in Children’s Court on the next court day, said Tom Wanta, administrator of the Milwaukee County Delinquency & Court Services Division. That could be the day after the arrest, or it could be later, depending on weekends and holidays. Staff evaluate the juvenile in order to choose from among three options on where the juvenile should be prior to the court appearance: released to go home; held in secure detention at the center; or sent to to an alternative setting, such as a temporary shelter, To make that decision, staff use something called the Detention Risk Assessment Instrument. The DRAI uses a point system, which is what Flynn referred to in making his claim. Points are determined based on the arrest for the auto theft, but also on what are known as aggravating and mitigating factors, if there are any. Aggravating factors -- which can lead to secure detention -- include whether the facts of the auto theft are more serious than a typical case; whether the juvenile has any prior or pending criminal cases; and whether the juvenile has a documented history of violence. Mitigating factors -- which can reduce the point total and lead to release -- include whether the juvenile is stable in school, and whether a responsible adult is available to supervise the juvenile. Staff has some discretion in assigning points. Here’s a summary of how the total points are scored: Score Where juvenile suspect should be before appearing in court 0 to 9 Released home 10 to 16 Alternative location, such as a temporary shelter 17 and up Secure detention at juvenile center Auto theft is worth 10 points -- not zero, as Flynn claimed -- which initially puts a juvenile in the middle range of the scoring system. But it’s possible staff could decide to release the juvenile, with an order to appear in Children’s Court on the next court day, if mitigating factors reduce the score to 9 or lower. If there are aggravating factors that raise the score to 17 or higher, staff could decide to hold the juvenile in secure detention until the first court appearance. At the court appearance, the staff makes a recommendation to the judge on where the juvenile should be while the case is prosecuted, assuming that the district attorney’s office decides to file charges. Then the judge decides. Our rating Flynn said that in Milwaukee County, juveniles arrested for car theft "get sent immediately home, because under the point system in juvenile court" on holding suspects, "a stolen car gets zero points." It’s possible for a juvenile arrested on an auto theft-related charge to be released home until appearing in court, usually the next day. It depends on the facts of the case and factors such as whether the juvenile can be supervised by a responsible adult. But under the point system, auto theft is worth 10 points, not zero, which typically would result in the juvenile being held in secure detention or at an alternative facility until appearing in court, depending on factors such as the juvenile having a prior record. For a statement that contains only an element of truth, we rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Edward Flynn	None	None	None	2015-10-19T05:00:00	2015-08-27	['None']
pomt-03677	Says he has "yet to get a response" from Barack Obama to his August 2010 letter making border security requests.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2013/apr/25/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-he-awaits-answer-barack-obama-augu/	Gov. Rick Perry says his 2010 plea to President Barack Obama for border security help remains unanswered. Perry made the appeal to Obama in August 2010 when they met on the airport tarmac in Austin, where Obama was visiting for the day. The governor mentioned the airport meeting when he appeared on CNN’s "The Situation Room" on April 5, 2013. Perry said "the president hadn't called up the governor of one of the largest states who has the longest border with Mexico and said, ‘Governor, what do you think we need to do about the issue of immigration?’ I would be open to that conversation any day." CNN’s Wolf Blitzer replied: "So if he calls you, are you ready to go to the White House and sit down with the president and try to come up with some sensible solutions to comprehensive immigration reform?" "Absolutely," Perry said. "As a matter of fact, I handed him a letter some two or three years ago on the tarmac at the Austin airport about that issue, about border security. And yet to get a response." At the Aug. 9, 2010, airport encounter, caught on TV cameras, Perry and Obama chatted for less than a minute, according to news stories. Perry ultimately handed his letter on border security to a White House aide, Valerie Jarrett. In the letter, Perry said he was renewing his invitation for the president and federal officials to meet with Texas officials on security issues. In addition, the letter urged federal drones to be flown along the border and mentioned Perry’s unfulfilled "standing request" for 1,000 National Guard troops to work with Texas law enforcement on security operations. Noting the Obama administration’s recently announced plans to send 1,200 National Guard troops to the border, Perry’s letter said the "deployment of just 286 National Guard personnel along the 1,200-mile Texas-Mexico border is clearly insufficient." We asked Perry’s office about the governor not hearing back from Obama. By email, spokesman Josh Havens said: "We are still waiting on a response from President Obama." Then again, Perry fielded a White House response at the time. Havens simultaneously emailed us a copy of an Aug. 27, 2010, letter to Perry signed by John O. Brennan, then assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism. In May 2013, Brennan was sworn in as director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Brennan’s letter, on White House letterhead, opened: "Thank you for your August 9, 2010, letter to President Obama regarding security concerns on our Southwest border. On behalf of President Obama, I wish to assure you that we understand your concerns and appreciate your outreach." Brennan’s letter further said that securing the border had been an Obama priority. The letter did not embrace any of Perry’s requests, but noted that a few days after his Austin stop, Obama signed the Southwest Border Security Act into law, enabling the "addition of substantial and varied law enforcement resources to enhance security on our southern border." As an example, the letter said, additional National Guard troops and "other security resources" would serve. "It is anticipated that Texas will have over 20 National Guardsmen serving as criminal investigative analysts in fusion centers and over 225 Guardsmen conducting ground surveillance," in National Entry Identification Teams the letter said. The letter closed: "We are united in our common interest and focused efforts to secure the Southwest border. Your continued engagement and partnership on this national security imperative is much appreciated." We emailed the White House and Department of Homeland Security on this topic and did not hear back. We also asked Havens if the governor responded to Brennan’s letter, and we filed an open-records’ request asking the governor’s office for border-related communications between the state and White House since Perry and Obama visited on the tarmac. No materials came our way in the first few days after we submitted the request. Our ruling Perry said he had "yet to get a response" to his 2010 letter to Obama requesting border security steps. That’s not so. Perry fielded a reply to his letter from a White House deputy about three weeks after the airport howdy.

pomt-15292	The federal deficit would pay for 40 gallons of "New Hampshire maple syrup" for everyone in the United States.	half-true	/new-hampshire/statements/2015/jul/22/kelly-ayotte/ayotte-says-deficit-could-pay-40-gallons-new-hamps/	During a town hall on July 1, 2015, in Colebrook, N.H., U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte used a regional example to explain the size of the federal deficit. She said the deficit -- some $483 billion last year -- would buy 40 gallons of maple syrup for every man, woman and child in the United States. Ayotte has used that example before, including a January town meeting in Goffstown. And she has used other colorful examples to illustrate the size of our nation’s deficit, telling voters in 2013 that it could pay "all of the 2013 salaries of every professional baseball player for the next 248 years." (That was True, by the way.) But what about the maple syrup comparison? Would $483 billion cover that 40 gallons for every U.S. resident? PolitiFact decided to check the math. This is a story of three numbers. The first is the U.S. budget deficit, which can easily be found in information from the official Congressional Budget Office. The deficit is the amount that the country runs short each year -- the difference between its income and expenses -- and shouldn’t be confused with the national debt, which is much larger because it’s the cumulative total of all past deficits, minus surpluses. The office’s report from January puts the 2014 deficit at $483 billion. The second number is the population of the United States. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, which keeps close track of such things, the nation had 320 million people by the end of 2014. (It’s added 1.3 million since then.) Dividing those two numbers, then, means that each person in the country has $1,509.40 of our nation’s deficit. That then leads to our third number: the price of maple syrup. How much of the flapjack topping could $1,509.40 buy? Fortunately, the U.S. Department of Agriculture tracks maple syrup prices, through its National Agriculture Statistics Service. It issued a bunch of numbers last month that can help us out. According those numbers, the average price of a gallon of maple syrup in New Hampshire in 2014 -- the same year as our $483 billion deficit and our 320 million population -- was $57.80. That generally tracks with local farm prices. When we checked, Corlis Farm in Northfield was charging $55 a gallon. Maple Ridge Sugar House in Loudon was charging $58 per gallon. And last year, Sunnyside Maples in Gilmanton was charging $55 for a gallon. The USDA figure was backed up by the New Hampshire Maple Producers Association. According to association publicist Robyn Pearl, it’s not going to go down anytime soon. "The price has been on a slow yet steady increase over the years, which reflects the same increase in production costs," Pearl said. If we use that $57.80 average, Ayotte’s claim gets, well, a little sticky. That $1,509.40 per U.S. resident would only buy a bit more than 26 gallons of syrup, not 40. We checked with Ayotte’s office to see what figures they were using. They referred us to the same set of statistics on maple prices -- from a year earlier -- but pointed to different numbers. They used the U.S. average price per gallon, which was $37.40 for 2013, and the New Hampshire wholesale price for syrup, which was $37.90 per gallon in 2012 and $46.10 per gallon in 2013. Using that national average price per gallon indeed yields 40 gallons of syrup per person, but Ayotte’s office confirmed she was talking about New Hampshire made maple syrup. Looking just at the New Hampshire numbers, the 2012 wholesale price for a gallon of syrup comes close, although the 2013 wholesale price yields only 32.8 gallons per person. (The 2014 wholesale price, which wasn’t cited by Ayotte’s staff, is $42.40 per gallon, which would given each person 35.6 gallons.) But those at Ayotte’s town hall meeting know they're not paying wholesale prices at their local sugar house, where gallons of syrup are going for well over $50. There’s a broader point here, of course. The senator’s statement was meant to give residents a handle on an otherwise incomprehensible figure -- the size of the U.S. budget deficit. That’s what Ayotte’s staff said she hoped to do. Just for fun, we decided to calculate how long 40 gallons of syrup would last the average American. While some of us in the Northeast might consume a gallon or more a year (don’t tell the dentist), the national average is between 2.5 to 4 ounces per person, according to the Agricultural Marketing Resource Center and Center for Northern Woodlands Education. In other words, 40 gallons of syrup should last the average American more than 160 years. And never mind the fact that giving that much syrup to everyone in the United States would be a sticky situation. New Hampshire only made 112,000 gallons of syrup in 2014, and there were only 3.2 million gallons produced in the United States that year; enough to give one gallon to every 100 people. In the words of Warner syrup producer Barbara Lassonde, "We don't make that much, and if we tapped every maple tree in the Northeastern quadrant of the country, I still don't believe we'd make enough." Our ruling U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte said the federal budget deficit is big enough to be able to buy 40 gallons of maple syrup for every resident of the United States. Ayotte’s office said she was calculating it based on generic U.S.-made syrup, but that’s considerably less expensive than New Hampshire-made syrup. If we were buying New Hampshire syrup wholesale using 2014 prices, the amount would come closer, but still not hit a full 40 gallons. And if we use retail costs in New Hampshire, it works out to 26 gallons, not 40. So her numbers are open to question, but her general point is valid: Either figure represents more than a lifetime supply for the average maple muncher in America. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-09836	The health bill's plan for comparative effectiveness research "would be used by the government to ration care."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/25/john-boehner/boehner-says-study-effectiveness-medical-treatment/	Many opponents of health care plans being considered by Congress have warned they would lead to government rationing of health care services. To which we say, yes they would. Health care is already rationed. Public and private plans have limited resources, and you can't just get any medical service you want anywhere at any time. That's rationing. It's a reality of health care today and would be under any of the plans being considered in Congress. And so we gave a False to former Democratic National Committee chairman Howard Dean when he said the plans include no rationing. But that's not to say many of the claims of rationing by the Republican opponents are right. In fact, many of them are very misleading, or outright wrong. We've weighed in previously on former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin's claim the bill would create "death panels" that will decide whether Grandma will get health care. It wouldn't. Here, we'll deal with another popular claim from Republican opponents of the plan: that government-sponsored research into medical care would be used to ration services. Most recently, the claim was made in a press release on the Web site for House Republican Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, on Aug. 18, 2009. It states: "The bill would establish a new tax on every health insurance policy to fund a government board that would be tasked with deciding which treatments are more cost-effective," the release states. "The research findings would be used by the government to ration care." The press release cites the part of the House bill that deals with establishing a Center for Comparative Effectiveness Research within the Agency for Healthcare Research. That's a bureaucratic way of saying the government would do studies to find out which medical treatments and medications work better than others, and which are most cost-effective. The idea is that this would help doctors and patients make better-informed decisions about the most effective treatment strategies. It's also expected to save money over time. A case for it was made on June 12, 2007, by Peter R. Orszag, then director of the Congressional Budget Office but now a member of the Obama administration, in an address to Congress: "Hard evidence is often unavailable about which treatments work best for which patients or whether the added benefits of more-effective but more-expensive services are sufficient to warrant their added costs." The findings, he said, suggest that better information about the costs and benefits of various treatments could substantially lower health care spending as well as "yield better health outcomes from the resources devoted to health care." Some opponents such as Boehner have argued that such research will lead to the government telling doctors what kinds of services or medications they can and cannot provide — rationing. Our ruling here may seem something of a paradox because, as we note above, Boehner would be right if he said there is rationing now and will be rationing in the future. But in this case, there actually are provisions in the bill about comparative research to make sure it is not used for rationing. Language in the House version of the health bill specifically states: "Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit the Commission or the Center to mandate coverage, reimbursement, or other policies for any public or private payer." And let's be clear, comparative effectiveness research has been done by the government for years and years. The Obama administration wants to greatly expand the amount of research. The economic stimulus package also included more funding for comparative effectiveness research. And the bill included a similar disclaimer that it would not mandate insurers to cover or reimburse one treatment or medication over another. "We definitely need more information about how cost-effective certain things are," said Katherine Baicker, a health economics professor at Harvard University. People are understandably nervous that these studies could lead to rationing of certain services, she said, but as a researcher, "It's hard for me to see how we can make better decisions without better information." AARP, the leading advocate for seniors, has long been a strong supporter of such research. "It boggles the mind" said AARP spokesman Jim Dau, how comparative effectiveness research has been portrayed by opponents of the health care plan as government rationing of care. "It's just good common sense," Dau said of the research. "It's giving individuals and doctors better evidence-based research so that they can make better decisions." Gail Wilensky, who ran the Medicare program under President George H.W. Bush in the early 1990s, is another big advocate of comparative effectiveness research. She views it as lobby-free information that can be used to empower patients. Wilensky envisions tiered co-payments based on the clinical appropriateness of various medical treatments. That's not rationing, she said. "As we get more advanced, we'll be able to move toward more precision medicine, where we can authorize even very expensive treatments if we know they are going to work," she said. So, for example, she said, if someone with cancer has a biomarkers that indicates they would be likely to respond to the treatment, there would be a lower co-pay. "We ought to be doing things better," Wilensky said. "We need to spend smarter and treat more effectively," We think it's reasonable to conclude that some insurers may decide to use the government's research findings to determine what kinds of medical services it will cover, or at least which ones it will cover first. But we think it's a stretch to call giving patients better information about which treatments and drugs are most effective "rationing." In fact, given specific language in the bill to the contrary, we think it's outright wrong for Boehner to claim the research findings would be used by the government to ration care. Our friends at FactCheck.org came to the same conclusion in an item that walks through the evolution of comparative effectiveness research. So we find Boehner 's claim that comparative effectiveness research findings "would be used by the government to ration care" to be False.

pomt-03392	"Currently, it takes up to 25 years to obtain U.S. citizenship legally" but the Senate bill "would allow immigrants who came to the United States illegally to obtain citizenship in just 13 years."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jul/07/jim-sensenbrenner/rep-jim-sensenbrenner-says-it-takes-25-years-obtai/	Don’t count U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin among Republicans supporting the kind of immigration reform endorsed with bipartisan backing by two-thirds of the U.S. Senate on June 27, 2013. The Senate’s approach, Sensenbrenner argues, would crowd out legal immigration by boosting incentives to enter America illegally through a head start on citizenship. How? "Currently, it takes up to 25 years to obtain U.S. citizenship legally," Sensenbrenner wrote in The Washington Times on July 1, 2013. "The Senate proposal, however, would allow immigrants who came to the United States illegally to obtain citizenship in just 13 years." His conclusion: "That’s a 12-year head start granted as a reward for illegally entering the country." We’ve heard senators state repeatedly that illegal immigrants would have to "get in the back of the line" to obtain legal status on the road to citizenship. So let’s examine Sensenbrenner’s claim as the spotlight moves to the Republican-held House, where the GOP may take a more piecemeal reform strategy featuring tougher enforcement on the Mexico-U.S. border. The current system To obtain citizenship, an immigrant needs to first obtain a green card and then wait either 3 or 5 years before applying for citizenship, said Madeleine Sumption of the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research organization. The length of the "pathway to citizenship" is the sum of the waiting time for whatever type of green card the person is eligible for, plus 3 to 5 years, she explained. The current immigration process is first-come, first-served and limits the total number of people admitted each year on family or employment visas granting permanent residency, noted another Migration Policy Institute researcher, Claire Bergeron. Long waiting lists have resulted. Overall, demand has exceeded supply since 1965, especially from Mexico, whose 1.3 million applicants on the waiting list made up 30 percent of the list as of November 2012. All told, more than 4.4 million people are "in line" for immigrant visas, though an unknown number of those people may already be here without authorization. There are also per-country caps in place. That has meant especially long waiting times not only in Mexico, but in China, India and the Philippines. Sensenbrenner’s claim It is the case, for some categories of aspiring Americans from a few countries where hundreds of thousands want to settle here, that wait times just to get in are 20 years or more. Then it’s another 3 to 5 years to obtain citizenship. Mexican nationals who are the adult children of U.S. citizens experience waits of 20 years before they can file for permanent-residence visas commonly known as green cards, Bergeron wrote in a March 2013 immigration primer for the institute. The same waits apply to Mexicans who are the adult unmarried children of lawful permanent residents of the United States. "The longest backlog -- for siblings of U.S. citizens coming from the Philippines -- is currently about 24 years," Sumption told us. "That means that people currently getting these green cards have waited 24 years for them." So for a large number of people from countries where interest in living in the United States is high, Sensenbrenner is right that waits of "up to" 25 years are a reality. When we asked Sensenbrenner’s office for backup, spokesman Ben Miller said Sensenbrenner had Mexican immigrants in mind when citing the 25-year figure, because they are the focus of much of the current debate. But backlogs for many other immigrants -- and some from Mexico -- are much shorter, the Migration Policy Institute study noted. Spouses of U.S. citizens, for example, get their green cards within about a year after applying, Sumption told us. And the spouses and children of lawful permanent residents from all countries typically wait 2 years before they can file for a green card. In countries other than Mexico and the Philippines, applicants for family-based immigrant visas typically wait 2 to 12 years before they can get a green-card application started. "Wait times vary dramatically depending on the applicant’s visa category and country of nationality," the MPI study found. In another part of the system -- employer-based immigration -- applicants with no more than a bachelor’s degree commonly see waiting times of 4 years or more for green cards. "When you add to that the fact that many have been in the country for 6 years on a temporary work visa before applying for green cards, plus a 5-year wait for citizenship, the total waiting time for these people before obtaining citizenship can be around 15 years," Sumption said in an email. Looking at the comparison Sensenbrenner says the Senate bill would allow the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States to obtain citizenship in 13 years. That’s accurate, based on multiple news accounts of the bill. Finally, Sensenbrenner does the math. He concludes that 25 minus 13 means a "12-year head start granted as a reward for illegally entering the country." In doing so, he takes the high end of the range, leaving out his previous qualifier that citizenship takes "up to" 25 years. Overall his math is on target for many applicants from Mexico and the Philippines, countries that make up 40 percent of the waiting list. But it misfires for many others. Notably, in addition, Sensenbrenner leaves out the fact that the Senate bill aims to bring down the waiting times. That is, he uses the bill’s 13-year citizenship path for illegal immigrants as part of his equation, but does not take into account the bill’s intent to drive down the long waits. The bill, Sumption said, provides a backlog clearance program that would issue visas to people currently waiting in line over a 7 to 9 year period. (It should be noted that one way the bill would prevent new backlogs from developing is to end future immigration visas for siblings of U.S. citizens.) So Sensenbrenner’s 25-year figure is weakened by his omission, at least in part. But, there is still a group of people who already have waited decades to get here who would see that undocumented residents are on a 13-year path, albeit one that has many hurdles. Our rating Sensenbrenner said it currently takes up to 25 years to obtain U.S. citizenship legally, but the Senate bill "would allow immigrants who came to the United States illegally to obtain citizenship in just 13 years." He’s right for a large group of would-be Americans who wait for 20 or more years to get in and then become citizens. But many others experience much shorter waits, and Sensenbrenner muddies the comparison by omitting the fact that, going forward if the Senate bill became law, wait times are expected to drop. We rate his claim Half True.	None	Jim Sensenbrenner	None	None	None	2013-07-07T06:00:00	2013-07-01	['United_States']
pomt-03811	The Air Force wants taxpayers to fund a fantasy football league.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/mar/22/blog-posting/bloggers-say-air-force-wants-taxpayers-fund-fantas/	Is the Air Force preparing to spend precious taxpayer funds as it faces sequester-driven budget cuts on a fantasy football league ? On blogs and on Twitter on March 20, 2013, people buzzed that it was the case, with a link to back it up. "What sequester? Air Force wants taxpayers to fund fantasy football league," read a headline at WashingtonExaminer.com. "Spared by the Sequester, So Far: Air Force Fantasy Football Program," said another at NationalReview.com. "Forget Budget Cuts," said Wired.com. " Air Force Is Ready for Some (Fantasy) Football." Some stories credited tips from a co-founder of conservative site RedState.com or a writer there. Does the Air Force want "taxpayers" to fund a fantasy sports league? Not so fast. Not your money Bloggers had noticed a March 19 "request for information" from an Air Force contracting office "seeking sources for providing the Air Force installations a Fantasy Football Program." The Air Force’s original request for information included some clues that taxpayers might not be involved. It mentioned the personnel center services division, and the Air Force’s "nonappropriated" purchasing office. The personnel center services division runs recreation and leisure programs for Air Force members and their families around the world, including clubs, bowling, golf, fitness, arts and crafts, and recreational shooting. It also manages the Air Force’s "nonappropriated funds" — money that comes from fees and other cash collected from airmen and their families who take part. That is to say: Money that doesn’t come from Congress. It’s not taxpayer money, and it’s not subject to budget cuts under the sequester. But it’s not a small amount of money, with tens of millions of dollars from overseas on-base slot machines alone. It even supports a different type of federal employee, not considered federal civil servants because they’re not funded through normal congressional appropriations. Those employees run the activities and programs that also include things like restaurants, youth centers, and auto and wood shops. The goal of all these programs, sometimes called "MWR" for morale, welfare and recreation, is just what it sounds like: to boost troop morale. And, for 17 years, they’ve included an annual program called the "Football Frenzy," said Air Force spokesperson Laurel Tingley. In 2011, for example, airmen who joined the Air Force Services Clubs could win a trip to the Super Bowl. This year, the personnel center services division wanted to find out what it would take to add fantasy football to the Frenzy. Thus, the request for "information and pricing on providing product branding, hosting, managing, and delivering all programs and materials related to running a Fantasy Football League," that would serve airmen, civilians and family members at "over 100 installations worldwide." "What we're looking at doing is enhancing a program that airmen have enjoyed for 17 years," Tingley said. "And the entire program is funded through (nonappropriated funds)." Tingley didn’t have details about exactly what the Air Force sought to create, but a fantasy football league wouldn’t have been unplowed ground in the world of military morale — the Navy organized a fantasy football contest with commercial sponsors in 2010 that offered a grand prize of $100,000. On March 21, 2013, the Air Force updated its request to say: "This RFI is issued by the Air Force Nonappropriated Fund Purchasing Office (AFNAFPO). All requirements, solicitations and subsequent contracts, if any, awarded through AFNAFPO are funded wholly with Nonappropriated funds. These funds are generated through user fees and charges at Air Force morale, welfare and recreation (MWR) programs worldwide. THEY ARE NOT APPROPRIATIONS FROM CONGRESS OR 'TAXPAYER' DOLLARS." By noon on March 22, 2013, it had canceled the request. Our ruling Headlines across the blogosphere and shared via social media suggested the Air Force wanted taxpayers to a fund fantasy football league — a charged claim as defense budgets face mandatory cuts. But the evidence was a "request for information," not a final decision to fund anything. Meanwhile, any money at stake wouldn’t have come from taxpayers, but "nonappropriated funds" generated by Air Force clubs and other activities designed to boost morale. We rate the claim False.

pomt-04416	Says Adam Hasner "gives the wealthy tax breaks worth $250,000 a year but hikes middle class taxes $2,000."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/oct/15/lois-frankel/lois-frankel-says-adam-hasner-gives-rich-hefty-tax/	The battle between two South Florida congressional candidates -- Republican Adam Hasner and Democrat Lois Frankel -- is largely about who is on the side of the middle class. Frankel tries to speak directly to middle-class taxpayers boasting in one ad: "I always take your side" and promises to strengthen Social Security and defend Medicare. She tries to portray Hasner as the pal of the rich and says in her ads that he "is never on our side." That message is counter to the image he has emphasized of understanding the struggles of the middle class. He says his public school teacher parents in Brooklyn only had $31 to their name when Hasner was born, and he vows to help small businesses and told the Miami Herald’s editorial board that his own home is "severely under water." Here, we will look at a claim from a Frankel ad called "Real": "Hasner gives the wealthy tax breaks worth $250,000 a year but hikes middle class taxes $2,000." We wanted to check to see if Frankel accurately characterized Hasner’s record on federal taxes. The Ryan and Romney tax plans When we asked the Frankel campaign for evidence of its claim, they pointed us to Hasner’s stated support for a budget plan written by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis,. who later became Republican nominee Mitt Romney’s running mate. Ryan’s plan doesn’t explicitly call for tax increases. Instead, it says that overall tax rates should be lowered -- Ryan suggests two new tax brackets 10 and 25 percent -- while eliminating loopholes, deductions and exemptions. Romney’s tax plan is similar, in that it too recommends across-the-board rates cuts in exchange for eliminating loopholes, deductions and exemptions. The idea behind both plans is to simplify the tax code while bringing in about the same amount of revenue, so as not to drive up the deficit. But at least two studies have suggested that the middle class would see tax increases if the most common tax breaks were eliminated, even if their overall tax rates drop. Frankel’s ad cited an ABC News report about one such report by staff for Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., which examined Ryan’s plan. The Casey report concluded that for those earning more than $200,000 a year "their net taxes fall significantly," while it is likely that those earning less than $200,000 would face an increase. A study by the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan group that analyzes tax plans, estimated that those earning at least a million dollars would receive an average tax cut of $265,000 under the Ryan plan. But the Tax Policy Center report also showed that Ryan’s plan would mean a net tax cut for every income group over $30,000 a year -- not a tax hike for the middle class, as Frankel claims. The discrepancy stems from a huge difference in methodology between the Casey report and the Tax Policy Center analysis of Ryan’s plan. The Casey report assumes -- without really knowing -- that Ryan and fellow Republicans would eliminate current deductions for state and local taxes, mortgage interest and charitable contributions, remove the employer‐provided health insurance exclusion, and tax 401(k) contributions. But that approach amounts to taking the worst-case approach to make the point. The Tax Policy Center, on the other hand, attributed no elimination of deductions to Ryan’s plan, noting that his plan doesn’t specify what Republicans would do. (Ryan’s plan does strongly suggest that some tax breaks would go and others would remain, but specifics are lacking). Democrats have made similar claims that Romney’s tax plan would give millionaires a tax break while raising them for the middle class. Romney’s plan has also lacked details making it difficult to analyze. What Hasner says So has Hasner explicitly supported the Ryan or the Romney plans? We should note that Hasner served in the Florida Legislature, not in Congress. So he’s never taken a vote on the Ryan plan. But in the past, Hasner clearly said he supported the Ryan plan. When he was running for the GOP primary for U.S. Senate, he repeatedly voiced his support for it. In 2011, the Washington Post The Fix blog-- one of the citations in Frankel’s ad -- said that Hasner "fully embraced" Ryan’s budget "a rare Senate candidate willing to take such a step." Hasner said he would vote for the plan "without hesitation" and suggested the plan "does not go far enough." And he chastized Republicans who were backing away from it: "A lot of Republicans are starting to waffle on this question. Some are backing away, some are hedging their bets, some are sticking their finger in to test the political winds. I want you to know that I fully support the Paul Ryan plan." But trailing behind in the Senate primary, Hasner switched to the congressional race in February 2012. Now as a candidate running in a left-leaning district where he needs the independent vote, Hasner often talks about his support for the "bipartisan Wyden/Ryan" plan. Is Ryan -- the GOP vice presidential candidate and hero of conservatives -- actually the author some sort of bipartisan plan? Well, sort of -- on paper. But that was a white paper about reforming Medicare -- not a detailed tax plan. Hasner told us in an interview that he supports extending expiring tax cuts, sometimes called the Bush tax cuts, for all incomes. "I support extending the current tax rates just like President Obama supported extending them back in 2010," he said. (That’s different than Frankel, who has repeatedly said like Obama she wants to get rid of tax cuts for those earning above $250,000.) Hasner said he supports the general principle of eliminating exemptions and cutting tax rates, but he declined to endorse the specific targets set forth in the Romney and Ryan plans. Hasner also said: "I will never support any tax increase on middle-income earners ever. ... If you're not going to eliminate loopholes and exemptions, then I wouldn't support lowering rates." Hasner said he was "not afraid" of more revenues coming into the government because revenues as a percentage of GDP are below historical levels. He says he supports "a responsible approach." The claim is the ad is "misleading and false," he said. Would Romney's plan result in tax increases on the middle class? "Not only do I believe the Romney plan doesn't do that, but I would never do that." Hasner wrote on his campaign website: "Reducing marginal rates while broadening the tax base through the elimination of loopholes and exemptions will produce enough revenue to ‘pay’ for cutting everyone’s tax rates and would not require any middle class tax increase, nor would it produce a net windfall for high income taxpayers." Hasner told us in an interview he supports maintaining exemptions for mortgage and child tax credits. He would support eliminating an exemption for employer-sponsored health care and putting in place a new health care tax credit. "I want to level the playing field for people who want to purchase health insurance as individuals and that means eliminating the exemption for employer-sponsored health care," he said. Our ruling Frankel’s ad says "Hasner gives the wealthy tax breaks worth $250,000 a year but hikes middle class taxes $2,000." The ad bases its claim on a proposal put before Congress by Paul Ryan, now the vice presidential nominee, which Hasner has praised in the past. The plan addressed many aspects of the federal government, including simplifing the tax code by repealing exemptions and cutting tax rates. But the impact of Ryan’s plan for the middle class is muddled. It’s not clear that it would result in a tax hike for the middle class, though some say it will. The tax plan lacked specifics, which makes it difficult to evaluate. Hasner says he won’t vote for a tax plan that includes middle-income tax increases. Meanwhile, the ad doesn’t mention the Ryan plan as the source of its claims and states without qualification that Hasner supports tax increases. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-07920	"The economy we preside over today is better than the one we inherited."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2011/jan/31/hank-johnson/johnson-says-economy-better-obama-became-president/	Georgia Congressman Hank Johnson used President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address last week to give his own state of the American economy. "There is no doubt that the economy we preside over today is better than the one we inherited," the representative said in a one-paragraph statement on his website. "But we know," added Johnson, a DeKalb County Democrat, who was one of Obama’s earliest supporters when he campaigned for the presidency in 2008, "we must do more to ensure that America and its workers can compete and win in the 21st century." His statement raised an interesting question: Is the economy better now than when Obama took office on Jan. 20, 2009? Officially, the nation’s economic recession ended in June 2009, but many Americans are still without jobs and most experts said the recovery is slow. Forty-four states are projecting budget shortfalls this year, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Principles. So how do you measure the economy? As Georgia State University economics expert Rajeev Dhawan noted to us, the economy is like a diamond. There are many facets to it. Johnson’s spokesman Andy Phelan said the main areas to consider when measuring the economy are the stock market, industrial production, consumer spending and exports. They were comparing the last two full years of George W. Bush’s presidency, 2006 to 2008, to the following two years. (Bush’s presidency ended on Jan. 20, 2009.) "I think jobs is the most important stat -- as you would probably agree - and we’ve seen 12 straight months of job growth in the private sector," Phelan told us in an e-mail. "In 2010, the private sector gained 1.3 million jobs -- the strongest job growth since 2006." Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke recently told a congressional committee that the economy has shown "hopeful" signs of growth -- citing increases in consumer spending and private-sector investment in new equipment and software. But Bernanke also said he was troubled by issues such as long-term unemployment and mortgage foreclosures. Bernanke said that the housing sector "remains depressed." RealtyTrac, which tracks foreclosures, last week reported that foreclosure activity jumped in 149 of the nation’s 206 largest metropolitan areas in 2010. Atlanta ranked third, behind Houston and Seattle. New home construction, though, has slightly increased since the end of 2008, The Associated Press reported,using data from the U.S. Commerce Department. In 2008, builders broke ground on 549,000 homes. Last year, construction began on 587,600 homes. Some frequently considered economic indicators, like the gross domestic product, which measures the nation’s output and its consumption of goods and services, have remained steady since 2006. Another popular economic measure, the Dow Jones industrial average, is hovering around 12,000, about a 50 percent increase from 7,949 on Jan. 20, 2009. The Dow decreased by about 50 percent between the beginning of 2007 and the beginning of 2009. Some may argue the drop between 2007 and 2009 was the result of a few extraordinary days on Wall Street. The Dow dropped 504 points on Sept. 15, 2008, the worst one-day decline since the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The Dow dropped by about 1,400 points during a five-day stretch in October 2008. On trade, there is some support for Johnson’s case,but clearly room for growth. The federal trade deficit was $38.3 billion in November 2010, according to the most recent figures available from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The $38.3 billion deficit was about 25 percent less than the largest deficit of the Obama presidency, $50.1 billion in June 2010. The deficit was $43.8 billion in November 2008, a 50 percent decline from the high of $66.4 billion in July 2008. Exports increased from the November 2008 total of $141 billion to the November 2010 figure of $159.6 billion. Unemployment is another trouble point for the congressman’s argument. The nation’s unemployment rate was 7.2 percent in December 2008. A year later, it was 9.9 percent. In December 2010, the rate was 9.4 percent; lower than at the end of 2009, but still higher than at the same point in 2008. Monthly job losses, which were brutal between July 2008 and June 2009, have stopped, and the data shows there is growth in that area. However, the number of discouraged workers -- people who’ve stopped looking for a job -- has doubled since the end of 2008, from about 642,000 that December to the December 2010 total of 1.3 million. Michael Pento, senior economist for Euro Pacific Capital, a Connecticut-based brokerage firm, said the economy has improved in the GDP, initial jobless claims and regional manufacturing. But he said it has worsened in the critical areas of housing, unemployment and -- in his greatest concern -- debt. The gross federal debt -- the amount of money the government owes itself -- has risen since the end of 2008 from slightly more than $10 trillion to its current total of about $14 trillion. Some economists prefer to use another measurement of debt when measuring the nation’s economic health. They focus on the public debt rather than gross federal debt, because the public debt will require real money to repay the lenders, which in turn would have a faster ripple effect in the private sector.The public debt -- which is held by individuals, companies, foreign governments and others -- is higher now than it was at the beginning of 2009. However, it is now a smaller percentage of the nation’s GDP than it was in January 2009. Some analysts like Pento worry the debt will drive the nation’s economy toward a cliff, without an air safety bag. "The economy can’t be deemed better now than when George W. Bush left office because the factors that led to the credit crisis exist today, only they have been vastly intensified," Pento told us. "How can anybody claim the economy is getting better?" Johnson’s office agreed that debt is a serious concern, but argued that job growth, manufacturing growth and improved consumer confidence are more important immediate factors in the economic recovery. So where does all of this leave us? Matthew Dowd, who worked as a strategist for Bush, argued in December that the economy has "worsened" since Obama took office. Our national PolitiFact site rated his statement Half-True. In many areas, the numbers show the economy has grown. However, there are analysts and members of Congress like Wisconsin’s Paul Ryan, a Republican, who worry the debt problem has grown during the Obama presidency and fear it will be a painful problem in the near future. The worst of the nation’s recent economic troubles began in mid-2008 and continued through much of 2009. "The growth is very strong," says Georgia State’s Dhawan, director of the university’s Economic Forecasting Center,who argues the economy has improved. In some areas, the economy has improved over the past two years in measurable areas like trade and the Dow. Congressman Johnson is correct about that. But major components like housing and unemployment are still in the dumps. Until those key areas turn around, it’s hard to argue that the overall economy has improved. Johnson’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give readers a different impression. Under our guidelines, the congressman’s statement rates as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-03818	"We have a federal government that thinks they have the authority to regulate our toilet seats."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/mar/21/ted-cruz/sen-ted-cruz-says-federal-government-thinks-it-has/	Toilet seats just got political. U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a constitutional lawyer recently elected to Congress, says they’re an intimate example of federal overreach. He name-dropped the familiar fixtures in his March 16, 2013, speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference, known as CPAC. "We have a federal government that thinks they have the authority to regulate our toilet seats," he said. Does the long arm of the law extend into your bathroom? Yes. But some constitutional scholars say that’s too far. Plumbing the Constitution Cruz, a Republican, is no stranger to the nation’s founding documents. He argued before the U.S. Supreme Court as the solicitor general of Texas and has written more than 80 briefs for the nation’s highest court. He might like to flush some of its decisions. Here’s what he told his CPAC audience: "There's the 10th Amendment, something our omnipotent federal government seems to have forgotten all about. The 10th Amendment provides that the powers not given to the federal government are reserved to the states and to the people. "How did we get a $16.5 trillion national debt? We have a federal government that thinks they have the authority to regulate our toilet seats and our light bulbs. We need to get back to the Constitution." We’ve written plenty about light bulbs (which, yes, are regulated) but hadn’t taken up the question of toilet seats. Here’s the thing about toilet seats and the Constitution. The 10th Amendment reserves powers for the states and the people — except those given to the federal government. And under current interpretations of the Constitution’s Commerce Clause and 14th Amendment, there’s power to federally regulate toilet seats. (Take that, commode!) How? Well, the federal government can regulate consumer products, access to public facilities for people with disabilities and workplace health and safety. Thus: • The Mine Safety & Health Administration says, "sanitary toilets shall have an attached toilet seat with a hinged lid and a toilet paper holder together with an adequate supply of toilet tissue." • The Occupational Safety & Health Administration says construction sites with 20 employees or more shall provide "1 toilet seat and 1 urinal per 40 workers." • The U.S. Access Board requires most restrooms to have at least one "accessible" toilet in buildings covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act, which means, in part, a toilet seat at a height of 17 inches to 19 inches. Springs to return seats to a lifted position aren’t allowed. Those MSHA and OSHA rules? Cruz’s office says the federal government "has no business regulating such minutia." It could be — and has been — worse. Take the Great Horseshoe Seat Scandal of the 1970s. The brand-new Occupational Safety & Health Administration — which draws constitutional authority mainly from the Commerce Clause — had decided to implement a variety of voluntary industry standards as law. And it turned out that plumbers had for decades agreed that public toilets should have open-front, elongated seats rather than the closed rings of home bathroom seats. (Why? Oh, it’s a matter of speculation that’s made us the laughing-stock of Europe, where experts make jokes that the chief of one American lab was too polite to repeat. But it might have something to do with, um, hygiene.) So businesses suddenly faced a federal mandate on seat shape. The "resultant outcries about picayune government regulations," as one newspaper columnist put it, helped land hundreds of OSHA regulations on a to-delete list. The shape of your public toilet seat was no longer federally regulated by the ‘80s. Plumbing fixtures now generally don’t face federal regulation. Instead, manufacturers follow voluntary industry standards, which often get the force of law from state and local governments. But they could. Commodes and the Commerce Clause Meanwhile, the regulations that yet exist — about workplace seat availability and public restroom seat height — strike Cruz as "regulating down to the minutia" on issues best left to states and local governments, said his press secretary, Catherine Frazier. He’s right that the federal government "thinks" it has that authority, according to constitutional scholars we consulted. Cruz’s former constitutional law professor at Harvard, Laurence Tribe, offered some examples where toilet seats are "obviously subject to federal regulation" under settled law: • The commercial sale of toilet seats, like other commodities, in transactions involving an interstate market are subject to regulation under the Commerce Clause. • The provision of adequate toilet facilities to workers in businesses affecting interstate commerce is subject to federal regulation under the Commerce Clause. • Ensuring that toilet facilities, like others, are made available without regard to race or disability is subject to regulation under the Commerce Clause and equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. The question of whether the Constitution should be interpreted to grant such power to the federal government exposes a deep rift among experts. Randy Barnett, who represented opponents of the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate, argues for a narrower Commerce Clause, as do libertarian scholars such as Ilya Shapiro of the Cato Institute. A few decisions since the 1990s have gone their way, including the recent ruling that the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate wasn’t justified by the Commerce Clause. The framers "gave Congress the power to regulate commerce, not to compel it," justices ruled. (The mandate was upheld under the government’s taxing power, instead.) But settled law still says toilet seats are fair game. "Basically, Cruz is taking an example that sounds silly — toilet seats! — but if you look at the legal basis for the regulatory authority, it's pretty well-established and not all that silly," said Kermit Roosevelt, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. "This is just political posturing, and Cruz, as a Harvard law grad, presumably knows it." Our ruling Cruz, railing against modern interpretations of the Commerce Clause and the 10th Amendment to the Constitution, said, "We have a federal government that thinks they have the authority to regulate our toilet seats." While federal attention to toilet seats has dropped since its brief foray into seat shape in the ‘70s, and now mainly addresses toilet access for workers and height for wheelchair users, Cruz is firmly right that the courts, Congress, and executive agencies claim federal power to regulate them. His toilet trivia is True. Editor's note: We updated this item on March 26, 2013, to clarify that the U.S. Access Board requires most restrooms in ADA-covered buildings to have at least one accessible toilet.

pomt-14330	Under Hillary Clinton, State Department "officials were sending official thank-yous to people who gave to the Clinton Foundation."	false	/punditfact/statements/2016/mar/28/grover-norquist/grover-norquist-says-state-department-employees-se/	Opinion polls consistently show that if there’s one thing Hillary Clinton is up against with voters, it’s that too many of them question her honesty. Anti-tax advocate Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, fed into that theme during an interview on Fox Business with host Maria Bartiromo on March 24, 2016. Norquist segued from talking about her presidential campaign fundraising to the "mixing of her official job as secretary of state and the Clinton Foundation." Norquist said, "We now know (that) officials were sending official thank-yous to people who gave to the Clinton Foundation. Letting them know ‘wink, wink, nudge, nudge’ that you didn’t just give to the Clinton Foundation. Hillary Clinton, secretary of state, appreciates what you’ve done." We wondered if Norquist's allegation was correct. When President-elect Barack Obama considered making Hillary Clinton his secretary of state, the immediate concern was that foreign interests might curry favor at the State Department by supporting her husband’s efforts at the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative, also called CGI. To clear the way for Clinton’s nomination, those organizations agreed to a number of measures to avoid real and apparent conflicts. Among the changes, the foundation would publish the names of its donors and separate itself from the Clinton Global Initiative. Bill Clinton would not raise funds for CGI, and CGI itself would no longer accept donations from foreign governments or hold events outside the United States. After all that, did Clinton's State Department really cross the line by sending officials thanks to the foundation's donors? We asked Norquist’s spokesman John Kartch for the source behind the statement that State Department officials were sending thank-yous to people who gave to the Clinton Foundation. Kartch sent us a link to a page on the website of Judicial Watch, which describes itself as a conservative educational group. Judicial Watch posted a number of documents it received through a Freedom of Information Act request to the State Department. The first few pages in the collection were an exchange of emails between Clinton’s chief of staff Cheryl Mills and other top aides at the State Department, and Amitabh Desai, director of foreign policy at the Clinton Foundation. (Before joining the foundation, Desai was a legislative aide to then-Sen. Hillary Clinton.) Desai wanted Secretary Clinton to speak at the closing session of the Clinton Global Initiative meeting on Sept. 25, 2009. The conversation begins on Aug. 22, 2009, with this letter from Desai to Mills and Huma Abedin, Clinton’s deputy chief of staff, at the State Department: To decode the lingo of CGI, "HRC" is Hillary Rodham Clinton, "WJC" is William Jefferson Clinton and "commitments" are agreements among aid groups, governments and often corporations to work on a particular project. Desai’s list of three commitments included: Launching a media campaign to reduce sexual violence against girls. It involved the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, several United Nations agencies, a large Brazilian ad agency and a foundation set up by a former hedge fund owner. Promoting the use of vitamin and mineral fortified food among poorer Indian households. It involved a major Indian food corporation. Expanding a micro-insurance fund. It involved an investment fund that had raised $44 million to provide small insurance policies in poor communities. Mills at the State Department answered, "I think this if fine but here's my question - how does this work - are these announced before or after she speaks and what relationship are they supposed to bear to what she says?" Desai said commitments are announced throughout the conference. "We could give you a list of all announcements as they get scheduled as we get closer to the meeting, and anything else that would be helpful." Mills replied, "It would be helpful to have list of commitments during whole session so she can reference more than those just around her speech." The final words in this email chain come from Caitlin Klevorick, a former consultant to the foundation who became a special assistant in the Secretary of State’s office. "One question is if we want to see if there is a decent mass of fs (food security) related commitments to announce together at closing as a ‘mega’ commitment," Klevorick wrote. That is the sum total of the interactions between State Department and Clinton Foundation staff, according to the emails obtained by Judicial Watch. We asked Kartch at Americans for Tax Reform if we had missed anything and did not hear back. Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, said he sees clear collaboration between the two entities. "State Department and Clinton Foundation staff worked together on how Mrs. Clinton could thank Foundation supporters for their commitments during a speech, which Mrs. Clinton did," Fitton said. "Mrs. Clinton, as the result of work by her aides and a Clinton Foundation representative, provided an official thank you during her speech." This is different from Norquist’s claim. Norquist said State Department officials were sending official thank-yous. The emails don’t describe that. Further, in her actual speech, Clinton didn’t thank anyone for contributing money. Early on, she did express her appreciation, but that was aimed at governments, not donors. "As secretary of state, I really, in terms of protocol, should be acknowledging all of the heads of state and heads of government who are here, but there are far too many," Clinton said. "So let me just express my deep appreciation for your involvement and for your presence here. We look forward to working with you and your governments as we move forward on the new agenda of the Obama administration." A moment later, she praises the entire audience. "This is an exceptional gathering of people, who have made exceptional commitments to bettering our world. We see it in everything you do. It seems a good opportunity, given the talent, the energy and the passion in this room, to talk about an exceptional global challenge, chronic hunger and what we all can do about it." Clinton spent the bulk of her speech talking about the White House policy to combat hunger. At the end, she told the audience, "We need your ideas and your feedback, and we need your active support in any and every capacity." Kathleen Clark, who specializes in public sector ethics law at Washington University in St. Louis, told told us she didn’t see any smoking gun in the emails Norquist offered as evidence. Our ruling Norquist said that State Department officials were sending official thank-yous to donors to the Clinton Foundation. We looked at the source documents he relied on and found nothing that supported his version of events. State Department staff did ask for lists of projects and partners in preparation for a speech Clinton was to give at a Clinton Global Initiative meeting. However, there is no hint that any staff member expressed official appreciation to any donor. There is no indication that money for those projects flowed through CGI. Finally, Clinton thanked governments for showing up, but didn’t thank donors. She praised the audience in general, but that would include many who were on the receiving end of CGI’s efforts. The documents do not say what Norquist suggested they said. We rate this claim False. Correction: An earlier version of this story said the Clinton Global Initiative and the Clinton Foundation separated in 2009. Actually, the groups separated in 2010.

pomt-08625	"I've been outspent by my opponents every time I've run for U.S. Senate."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2010/sep/20/russ-feingold/russ-feingold-says-hes-been-outspent-opponents-eve/	Russ Feingold has spent 18 years in the U.S. Senate, 28 years in elective office. The Democrat has never lost an election. Yet, in his bid for a fourth Senate term, against first-time candidate Republican Ron Johnson, Feingold is positioning himself as the underdog. To be sure, the latest Federal Election Commission reports -- for spending from Jan. 1 through Aug. 25 -- show Johnson outspent Feingold $4.55 million to $4.28 million. Feingold says Johnson, a multi-millionaire Oshkosh businessman, may wind up running the most expensive campaign in state history. We won’t be able to tally that up until after the election. But what about this claim by Feingold: "I've been outspent by my opponents every time I've run for U.S. Senate." Feingold has made the statement, or a variation of it, many times: In TV interviews on the night of the Sept. 14 primary, in a magazine interview, in an e-mail solicitation to supporters, in a blog post on his campaign website and on "The Ed Show" on MSNBC. So, is it true? The claim seems pretty straightforward, one candidate versus another candidate in each of Feingold’s three previous Senate campaigns. Indeed, when we asked the campaign to support Feingold’s statement, senior adviser John Kraus pointed to spending by Feingold and his various opponents -- not spending by outside groups, which would complicate matters. But here is the twist: Kraus said Feingold compares his campaign spending to the spending by all of the candidates in an election -- the Republican he faced head-to-head in each November contest, as well as major party candidates eliminated in the primary. Call it me-against-them math. For instance, in Feingold’s last election, he outspent GOP nominee Tim Michels by nearly $3.7 million in the two-year period before the general election, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission. But Feingold tosses in what was spent by unsuccessful GOP primary candidates Russ Darrow and Robert Welch. By that measure, all of the GOP candidates spent $11.6 million -- more than the $9.24 million spent by Feingold alone. It’s a convenient argument, especially when you are using the "outspent every time" line in fund-raising appeals. But it also confounds logic. Michels, Darrow and Welch all sought the Republican nomination in 2004 -- just as Feingold was part of a three-way battle when he won the seat in 1992. In the 1992 race, FEC records show Feingold spent $1,979,488 -- the least among the other major candidates. In the Democratic primary, Feingold defeated Jim Moody who spent $2,828,211 and Joseph Checota, who spent $4,022,344. Feingold then defeated Bob Kasten, the Republican incumbent, who spent $5,427,163. Using Feingold’s me-vs-them math, everyone could say they were outspent. So is it possible that everyone spent the least and no one spent the most? Of course not. Mike McCabe, head of the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, which tracks campaign spending and lobbies for public funding of campaigns, said the average voter would think of the opponent as the head-to-head matchup. So let’s line the general election candidates that way, with their spending in the two-year period before the election. 1992: Kasten: $5,427,163 Feingold: $1,979,488 1998: Republican nominee Mark Neumann: $4,373,953 Feingold: $3,846,089 2004: Feingold: $9,239,908 Michels: $5,542,087 So Feingold was outspent twice, and in the third race spent nearly $3.7 million -- or about 67 percent -- more than his opponent. That’s not close by anyone’s math. (A footnote: While Johnson can tap his own wallet during the fall campaign, Feingold isn’t cash-poor. The latest FEC reports show Feingold had $4.3 million on hand, more than four times the $940,642 listed for Johnson.) So where does that leave us? In positioning himself as an underdog, and seeking campaign money from donors, Feingold says he has always been outspent by his opponents. Though that is true in two races, he uses some twisted logic -- and math -- to get there on the third, tallying up spending by Republican primary candidates he never faced to obscure that he vastly outspent the one he did. On Election Day, one Democrat faces one Republican. That’s the choice for voters. And that’s the approach we use. Tossing in the kitchen sink leads us to throw in a match.

pomt-00096	"Seniors can be charged five times what anybody else is charged for health care for pre-existing conditions" under the Republican health care bill.	mostly false	/north-carolina/statements/2018/oct/30/linda-coleman/linda-colemans-comments-seniors-and-health-care-ex/	As the midterm elections draw closer, Democrats across the country are narrowing their focus on a single key issue: health care. In North Carolina’s 2nd Congressional District, which includes parts of Franklin, Johnston, Wake, Nash and Harnett counties, Democrat Linda Coleman has taken frequent aim at incumbent George Holding for his repeated attempts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. During a town hall in Wake County Friday, Coleman listed the many changes that would have taken effect had the GOP’s American Health Care Act of 2017, which passed the House before failing in the Senate, actually become law. One change she mentioned made our ears perk up. "Seniors can be charged five times what anybody else is charged for health care for pre-existing conditions," Coleman said. The Coleman campaign pointed to an article from the AARP to support her claim. "George Holding voted for the American Health Care Act which, had it passed, would have made it so that seniors could be charged 5-to-1 for their premiums," campaign manager Mimi Wilson said in an email. Coleman, a former state representative, is not the first Democratic candidate to make this claim. In September, U.S. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., said she had voted against such a provision when she said no to the AHCA — a claim PolitiFact rated Half True. Before that, PolitiFact awarded another Half True to a health care advocacy group for claiming several Republican representatives had voted to let insurers "charge five times more for people over 50." As PolitiFact noted then, the AHCA did include a provision that would have permitted insurance companies to charge older adults five times more than younger people, as Coleman said. But Coleman’s statement omitted several caveats that would give a slightly different impression. And while the related statements PolitiFact previously checked focused specifically on people older than 50, Coleman’s claim mentioned "seniors" more generally, making it more sweeping. There is no precise age of a senior, but Merriam-Webster defines it as an elderly person. Before the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, older adults paid about four or five times the premiums charged to younger adults for the same coverage, according to an analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a leading authority on health care. The Affordable Care Act changed the game by putting a cap on the amount that insurance companies could spike premiums for older adults. Under the new rules, insurers could charge older adults no more than three times the amount paid by younger adults. But Section 135 of the AHCA would have increased the cap so insurance companies could have charged some people older than 50 up to five times what younger adults had to pay. The same provision would have also allowed states to set their own standards. So Coleman has a point that Republicans tried to let insurance companies charge older Americans five times what they charged younger people. What she did not say, however, is that the Affordable Care Act already allows insurance companies to charge older people three times as much. By omitting this caveat, she may have led listeners to believe that the 5-to-1 ratio was a more drastic change than it really was. It’s also worth noting that the GOP proposal would have only affected older adults who had purchased insurance on the Affordable Care Act’s individual exchange market — another fact Coleman did not mention. Coleman also goes too far by saying "seniors" would be the ones impacted by the change. In fact, the 5-to-1 ratio would not have applied to the majority of seniors who get coverage from Medicare or to older people who get coverage through their employer. That said, the Republicans’ AHCA would have increased health care costs for older adults in another way, by replacing income-based tax credits with a credit based on age. The proposed tax credits for adults over 60 were only twice the amount adults under 30 would have received. This would have meant smaller credits for elderly people than under the status quo. According to AARP calculations, older adults making $25,000 per year would have earned tax credits that were 50 to 80 percent smaller, on average, than under current law. Our ruling Coleman said that under the GOP repeal bill, "Seniors can be charged five times what anybody else is charged for health care for pre-existing conditions." She has a point that the AHCA would have allowed insurance companies to charge adults between the ages of 50 and 64 up to five times what they charged others for the same coverage. But Coleman’s use of the word "seniors" is too broad and potentially misleading, and her statement omitted at least three key points: Under the status quo, insurance companies can already charge older adults three times what they charge younger adults. The bill’s provision would not have applied to seniors receiving their insurance from Medicare or older adults with employer-provided coverage, which is how most older people get their coverage. The bill’s provision would have let states implement their own ratios separate from the 5-to-1 default. Overall, Coleman’s claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-00326	"Special education categorical aid" from the state "hasn’t been raised in over a decade."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/sep/20/tony-evers/evers-special-education-funding-claim-passes-test/	State schools superintendent Tony Evers, the Democratic challenger facing Gov. Scott Walker, has pledged to seek $606.1 million increase in funding for special education programs, which would bring funding for such services to $900 million by 2021. "School districts have a legal obligation to kids with disabilities, and they are required to provide those services," Evers said when he made the announcement. "That, in turn, puts pressure on the rest of the school budget. It’s time to change that momentum." States use different methods to allocate special education funds. Wisconsin is one of five that reimburse schools for the costs incurred for educating special-needs students. It is considered "categorical aid" -- that is, based on a category outside of the regular funding formula. According to a report from the state Department of Public Instruction: "This categorical aid is the state’s primary direct fund source to recognize the additional costs of educating pupils with disabilities. This critical aid program has widespread statewide impact providing funding for all pupils with disabilities, approximately 14 percent of Wisconsin pupils, providing equal benefit across all school districts." Evers’ request would more than double the state reimbursement rate for school districts’ special education costs, from 27 percent to 60 percent by 2019. "We’re going to add $600 million to special education categorical aid; it hasn’t been raised in over a decade," Evers said at a primary election forum broadcast Aug. 16, 2018, by WRRD Resistance Radio "Devil’s Advocates." Is Evers right? The evidence When asked about special education funding, a spokesman for the state Department of Public Instruction directed PolitiFact Wisconsin to the Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau, a nonpartisan entity considered the gold standard on state budget matters. According to the fiscal bureau, in the 2006-2007 budget, the number was just over $350 million. In every year since then, the total has been just under $369 million -- $368,939,100, to be exact. Abdur Chowdhury, Marquette University Department of Economics Professor Emeritus, said inflation in the U.S. from 2007-’18 averaged between 1 percent and 2 percent. Thus, he said, "in later years, you need to provide more nominal aid in order to be equal to real aid in the early years." So, to keep up with inflation, the $368,939,100 in fiscal year 2007 aid would have to have amounted to this much in subsequent years: 2008-’09 -- $381,741,700 2009-’10 -- $388,003,320 2010-’11-- $400,250,755 2011-’12 -- $408,533,744 2012-’13 -- $414,517,781 2013-’14 -- $421,242,038 2014-’15 -- $421,742,043 2015-’16 -- $427,062,373 2016-’17 -- $436,160,315 At the same time, the report notes that while costs have increased, Wisconsin has experienced a decrease in special education enrollment since fiscal year 2007: 2007-2008 -- 124,520 2008-2009 -- 123,734 2009-2010 -- 123,412 2010-2011 -- 122,763 2011-2012 -- 121,881 2012-2013 -- 121,378 2013-2014 -- 120,698 2014-2015 -- 118,601 2015-2016 -- 118,923 2016 -2017 -- 118,209 That represents an enrollment drop of 5.07 percent from 2007-’08 to 2016-’17. The enrollment counts for 2018-’19 are not final, but they are expected to again decrease. So, all this raises a question about what has happened with the per-student average -- and whether that has kept up with inflation. According to the Department of Public Instruction, special education costs per pupil in 2008-’09 was $10,388, with the state on average paying $2,981, or nearly 29 percent per pupil. In 2018, the estimated cost per pupil is at $12,084, with the state on average paying $3,140, or nearly 26 percent per pupil. So, had the per-pupil amount being paid by the state kept pace with inflation, it would be an estimated $3,489.18 in 2018, not the projected $3,140. A DPI spokesman pointed out that the per pupil figures are just special education costs, and "those ride on top of regular education costs." The Walker team When asked about Evers’ claim, Walker campaign spokesman Austin Altenburg pointed PolitiFact Wisconsin to Walker education initiatives that feature targeted aid in the form of grants and other avenues for special education students: In the last budget, the governor approved DPI’s request for Special Education Transitions Incentive Grants ($6.1 million). This program provides payment to school districts based on postsecondary education and employment for pupils with disability. The definition of postsecondary is a reference to any education beyond high school. Project SEARCH, a business-led collaboration that helps young people with disabilities gain and maintain employment through hands-on training and in-field career exploration. Project SEARCH is a national program developed in Cincinnati in 1996 and has grown to include programs in 42 states. In 2014, Walker signed legislation for a $35.4 million expansion to the Wisconsin Fast Forward worker training program, which included $850,000 to expand Project SEARCH sites in the state from seven to 27 over three years. Walker approved Special Education Transitions Readiness Investment Grants ($1.5 million). These grants fund transportation for special needs students to internships or work, training for school staff, and additional staff to support coordinating work experiences for special needs students with local businesses and organizations. Walker proclaimed 2014 as a Year of a Better Bottom Line to promote the employment of people with disabilities. Altenburg did not say whether he was arguing these programs more than make up for the lack of increase in the main aid program. In any case, Evers was talking about the main categorical state aid for education, and that is what we are focusing on here. Our rating Evers said "special education categorical aid" from the state "hasn’t been raised in over a decade." The Walker administration has launched several initiatives that feature targeted aid in the form of grants for special education students, but the special education categorical aid continues to be set at nearly $369 million. Data shows a per-pupil increase in raw dollars paid by the state, from $2,981, or 28.6 percent, per pupil in 2008 to an estimated $3,140, or 25.98 percent, paid per pupil in 2018. But that increase is more than eaten away by inflation. And the state is paying a lower share of the cost per pupil. We rate Evers’ statement Mostly True.

pomt-05700	Says he "cut taxes by more than $600 million" when he was governor.	true	/virginia/statements/2012/mar/09/george-allen/george-allen-says-he-cut-600-million-taxes-governo/	Republican senate candidate George Allen says he has the will and experience to bring tax relief to Virginia families. "When I was elected Governor, we had an audacious agenda that naysayers said couldn’t be enacted with a Democrat majority in the state legislature," Allen said in a Feb. 23 guest column for InsideNova.com. "However, we worked across party lines and enacted historic reforms. Working together, we cut taxes by more than $600 million..." We’ll stipulate that Allen, who was governor from 1994 to 1998, did convince a Democrat-controlled legislature to pass major reforms to welfare, criminal sentencing and juvenile justice. But his claim of cutting taxes by $600 million, which Allen first made in his farewell address to the General Assembly at the end of his term, has gone largely unexamined. Until now. We asked Dan Allen, a spokesman for the Allen campaign, for proof. He sent us a list of more than a dozen bills and budget changes that occurred on George Allen’s watch as governor. We scoured economic impact statements for those pieces of legislation and searched newspaper archives to find monetary values for each item. Three of the biggest tax cuts were approved in 1994. *A Social Security income tax deduction for self-employed Virginians valued at $162.1 million over six years, according to a 1997 estimate of the Finance Department. The measure was introduced by previous Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, a Democrat, in his farewell budget. *A tax cut for senior citizens that the Finance Department valued at $215.7 million over six years. The action was tied to a settlement after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a Virginia policy of taxing the pensions of federal retirees but not of state government retirees. The high court ruled the groups had to be treated equally. *A tax cut on the tangible assets of corporations worth $104.3 million over four years. The program was originally passed under Gov. Gerald L. Baliles in 1988 and slated to last for eight years. It was suspended for two years in 1992 under Wilder, who was battling a poor economy. Wilder, in his 1994 farewell budget, urged resuming the tax cut for the final four years and Allen, who came to office that January, agreed. Those three cuts add up to $482.1 million. In 1997, Allen signed a bill giving self-employed Virginians a break on unemployment insurance taxes that was worth $137 million over four years, according to the Finance Department document. The campaign also sent us a list of smaller tax cuts that passed when Allen was governor. We found their value by researching impact statements that were prepared at the time by the Department of Planning and Budget. Here’s the list: *Major Business Facility Jobs Tax Credit, 1994, worth $2.1 million over two years. *Coal Employment Enhancement Credits, 1995, totaling $33.2 million over two years. *Enterprise Zones, 1995, worth $2.8 million over two years. *Film Production Tax Exemption, 1995, worth $571,000 in two years. *Military Tax Relief, 1996, worth $600,000 in two years. *Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit, 1996, totaling $1.25 million in two years. *Space Flight and Space Launch Activities, 1997, worth $1.35 million annually. *Worker Retraining Tax Credit, 1997, worth $2.1 million in one year. *Virginia Coal Employment and Production Incentive Tax Credit, 1997, worth $13 million over two year. The list from Allen also included the BPOL tax cut on the earnings of businesses. The local tax was estimated to generate $300 million annually. The legislation allowed varying tax reductions depending on the size cities and counties. We were unable to find a value for the BPOL cut and the Allen campaign didn’t have one. Dan Allen did not include this reduction in his $600 million calculation. "Localities had their own flexibility on this, so it would be hard to quantify," he said. They also didn’t include tax cut proposals from George Allen’s farewell budget in 1998, which news reports valued at $350 million. The major one, approved by the General Assembly, was setting aside $260 million to phase in the first two years of a car tax cut promised by incoming Gov. Jim Gilmore, a Republican. We should note that Allen also proposed a massive $2.1 billion package of tax cuts in 1995 that was opposed by the business community and defeated by Democrats in the General Assembly. And despite Allen’s tax cutting efforts, state spending rose at an average level for Virginia governors during Allen’s term. Our ruling: George Allen said more than $600 million in taxes were cut during his governorship. We came up with $676.1 million in cuts, although we should point out that some of these reductions took place over six years. Allen, however, never qualified the time period for the tax cuts. And he arguably could have added other reductions to his list. We rate his statement True.	None	George Allen	None	None	None	2012-03-09T10:28:02	2012-02-23	['None']
pomt-07806	"The Constitution doesn't allow the governor to not-spend appropriations funds."	half-true	/florida/statements/2011/feb/17/jd-alexander/senator-makes-point-about-rick-scotts-authority-ni/	When Florida Gov. Rick Scott announced he had decided to kill a high-speed rail line connecting Tampa and Orlando, legislators, local officials, union groups and others grumbled about Scott's timing and reasoning. Then many of them thought: Wait, can he even do that? After all, the Legislature created the Florida Rail Enterprise in 2009 to manage the construction of a high-speed line, and then budgeted $300 million in state funds to help build the project. The rest of the money -- $2.4 billion -- was coming from Washington. Following Scott's announcement on Feb. 16, 2011, Senate Budget Committee Chairman J.D. Alexander suggested Scott overstepped his authority in declaring the rail project dead. "The Constitution," he said, "doesn't allow the governor to not-spend appropriations funds." And there is $300 million appropriated for the rail line between Orlando and Tampa, Alexander said. Is Scott overstepping his Constitutional powers? Can the rail project be saved by state lawmakers? The fact that Scott said he would reject federal high-speed rail wasn't itself shocking. The new governor has long been critical of President Barack Obama's spending policies and approach to government. But the timing of Scott's announcement -- at a hastily arranged morning press conference -- sent lawmakers in Washington and Tallahassee scrambling. In Washington, U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson and members of Florida's Congressional delegation pivoted to see if another agency could receive the federal money instead and manage the rail project. U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood on Thursday gave Florida lawmakers one week to see if they could work out a deal, but said that Scott would have to sign off on any agreement. In Tallahassee, lawmakers similarly were scratching their heads and wondering what's next. A veto-proof majority of the Florida Senate wrote LaHood asking for time to seek an alternative to keep the 84-mile-long rail project alive while suggesting that the state's Florida Rail Enterprise could manage the project without Scott's approval. State Sen. David Simmons, R-Altamonte Springs, suggested another option -- though in its infancy -- would be to create a public corporation that could insulate the state from potential cost overruns to build the train, or operational losses once the train is running. "We want to try to keep this alive," Simmons said. Scott vs. the Legislature As Simmons, Nelson and others work on one hand to circumvent Scott, they also continue to poke at the governor by saying he can't just do this unilaterally. The current state budget includes $131 million in high-speed rail development (line item 2094). That's part of the $300-million-or-so the state has pledged as part of the overall $2.7 billion rail project. Alexander's contention is that, without the approval of the Legislature, Scott must spend that money on high-speed rail. He has a point. State statutes prohibit the governor from "impounding" state funds -- meaning the governor cannot simply choose to not spend money budgeted. The governor has to veto a spending proposal, or accept it. And if he accepts it, he must spend the money for that purpose. The wrinkle in this case, of course, is that Gov. Charlie Crist signed the current budget, not Scott. But the budget is a law, which Scott is obligated to follow. Alexander made the same contention when it came to Scott's decision to sell the state two airplanes, saying the sale may have violated the law. The current state budget includes funds to maintain and operate the planes, and Scott just can't ignore the line item in the budget. Scott said the decision was completely legal. A second point: While most of the federal money for the rail project has not yet been awarded, some has. The state received $66.66 million in a federal grant in May 2010 to begin implementing plans for the high-speed line. Officials say about $26 million of that money already has been spent. "The bottom line is that he can't reject this money: It was already approved by another Legislature and another governor," Simmons said. "It's like trying to veto a bill after it becomes law. It's too late." Scott still holds most cards The money in play -- the $300 million in state funding and the smaller federal portion -- is peanuts when considering the entire $2.7 billion project. And that is where Scott has the upper hand, lawmakers, former state officials and transportation experts told us. He can veto future appropriations in the state budget, whether the source of the funds is state money or federal. If somehow, those vetoes are overridden, Scott can wreak havoc on rail plans in other ways. If a bond issue is required, he could try to kill the project through a vote on the Cabinet, or he could to hold up giving away the right-of-way to build the rail line. Or he could order his Department of Transportation secretary to fire people associated with the rail project. "He has the ability to direct agency heads and the ability to control expenditures that come into the budget over the next few years through a veto," said former state Sen. Dan Gelber, who was the Democratic candidate for attorney general. "If the governor's dead set on making it not happen, he can make it not happen." Even Alexander said the idea of rail is likely dead in Florida as long as Scott opposes it. "It may be a moot point when he's clearly trying to pull the plug," said Doug Callaway, president of Floridians for Better Transportation, a statewide transportation lobbying group. Though we think Alexander should have cited state statutes and not the Constitution, he is technically right that Scott is required to spend money in the state budget the way it is appropriated. That means the Legislature could play a game of chicken, forcing Scott to spend the $131 million in the 2010-11 budget, and maybe the remaining $170 or so million of state funds, and maybe even the $66.66 million in federal money. But getting him to spend the necessary money beyond that, all the federal and state money actually needed to complete the rail program, is a much taller order. And when it comes to the outcome of rail in Florida -- at least when it comes to the Florida Legislature -- that is today a much more important point. That's the context that gives Scott the upper hand. We rate this statement Half True.	None	J.D. Alexander	None	None	None	2011-02-17T19:46:17	2011-02-16	['None']
pomt-06532	Says that politicians who approved collective bargaining restrictions for public employees "exploited a loophole exempting themselves from Senate Bill 5."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2011/oct/07/we-are-ohio/we-are-ohio-says-politicians-who-approved-collecti/	A statewide TV commercial urging rejection of Issue 2 tells viewers that rank-and-file public workers are willing to make sacrifices in order to reduce the cost of government while powerful politicians who make the rules are finding ways to avoid the pain. Issue 2 is the voter referendum on Senate Bill 5, a new law that reduces collective bargaining power for public workers and makes several other changes to Ohio’s collective bargaining law. If voters reject Issue 2 on Nov. 8, SB 5 will be repealed. We Are Ohio, backed by labor groups and Democrats, produced the commercial, which has been in heavy rotation lately. The commercial flashes an image of Republican Gov. John Kasich, an Issue 2 supporter, while a narrator describes the sacrifices politicians have demanded of public workers to help balance the state budget. "But those same politicians exploited a loophole exempting themselves from Senate Bill 5," the narrator says. The SB 5 referendum will be among the most watched elections this fall, so PolitiFact Ohio is committed to helping voters parse through the onslaught of campaign messages before election day. On its face, the statement is this commercial appeared flawed. For one, elected officials already were exempt from the state’s old collective bargaining law, which was passed in 1983 and replaced by SB 5. Secondly, lawmakers cannot raise or cut their own pay if they wanted to. They can only adjust the pay of future state representatives and senators. We asked the organization that produced the commercial, We Are Ohio, to explain how the politicians who passed SB 5 exempted themselves from the law. Melissa Fazekas, a spokeswoman for We Are Ohio, said the exemption can be traced to page 32 of the 304-page bill. A citation also appears on the screen during the ad narrator’s claim, along with a written message that says, "Senate Bill 5 payment provisions: Do Not Apply to Politicians." Language on that page of the bill relates only to payment provisions within SB 5. The exemption -- for elected officials and certain other workers -- is from sections 124.14, 124.15 and 124.152 of Ohio Revised Code, all of which deal with a job classification plan the Ohio Department of Administrative Services sets for state workers. The plan, which lists various job titles and responsibilities, is tied to a salary schedule in Ohio law that gives automatic pay increases to workers based on seniority. SB 5 eliminates those increases and awards pay increases based on performance. But keep in mind, elected legislators already were exempted from that pay schedule. The other half of the claim, that "politicians exploited a loophole," underscores the commercial’s overall message, that state lawmakers used trickery to avoid playing by the same rules they’re forcing public workers to play by. But the exemption is hardly a loophole. Lawmakers already were exempt from existing laws relating to the job classification plan and collective bargaining. SB 5 alters those laws while keeping the exemptions for elected officials and others intact. Legislators’ salaries are set in state law. The Ohio Constitution prohibits lawmakers from in-term pay raises or decreases. Their current pay — a base salary of $60,584 with significant additional pay for leadership positions and certain committee assignments — was last adjusted in 2008, the final year in a series of increases that was part of a bill passed in 2000. As for benefits, state lawmakers already pay health insurance costs and contribute toward their pension in line with SB 5’s provisions. Medical coverage rates and required pension fund contributions for lawmakers mirror those of unionized state workers. Therefore, they typically pay at least 15 percent of their medical insurance premiums and, if enrolled, must contribute 10 percent of their salary to the retirement system. The claim in the ad does contain an element of truth -- legislators are exempted from several provisions of SB 5. But the portion of the claim that they’ve exploited a loophole leaves out important details that would give a different impression. Those details include that lawmakers have long been exempt from Ohio’s collective bargaining law, that they already pay the same percentages for medical and pension benefits as SB 5 would require and that their wage is set by statute. On the Truth-O-Meter, a statement that has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression rates one way: Mostly False.

pomt-13280	Says Donald Trump’s tax plan gives the wealthy and corporations "more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/11/hillary-clinton/clinton-right-trump-tax-plan-gives-more-rich-bush-/	With a backdrop of leaked lewd comments and Bill Clinton’s alleged sexual misconduct, you may not necessarily remember what Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton said about tax policy in the deeply personal and nasty Oct. 9 presidential debate. When Trump touted his proposal to deliver tax cuts for all, Clinton pointed out that his tax plan would help millionaires and billionaires like himself the most. "His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they’ve ever had, more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two," Clinton said. "Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift." Is Clinton right that the wealthy would benefit from Trump’s tax plan twice as much as they did under the Bush tax cuts? The Clinton campaign told us their data comes from an analysis by the conservative Tax Foundation and the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities on after-tax incomes of the top 1 percent. We also looked at the share of tax relief received by the top 1 percent as a percentage of GDP. The evidence shows Clinton is right. The Bush tax cuts As a refresher, the Bush tax cuts, enacted under President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003, reduced the then-top marginal tax rate of 39.6 percent rate to 35 percent, the 36 percent rate to 33 percent, and so forth. The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimated that the Bush cuts increased the after-tax income of the top 1 percent between 5.3 percent and 6.7 percent from 2004 to 2012 (tax rates for high-income earners were raised the following year). Altogether, the top 1 percent received a cut equivalent to about 0.66 percent of GDP (the Bush tax cuts were altogether 2.4 percent of GDP, while the top 1 percent received 27.5 percent of the cuts.) Trump’s plan Trump’s plan would increase after-tax incomes of the wealthy between 10.2 to 19.9 percent, according to the Tax Foundation, and deliver a tax cut equivalent to about 1.32 percent of GDP. Two key provisions in Trump’s latest tax plan, released September 2016, are particularly relevant to this fact-check. First, Trump would collapse the current seven tax brackets into four, reducing the current top marginal income tax rate of 39.6 percent to 33 percent. (His previous tax plan called for a top marginal rate of 25 percent.) Second, Trump would also reduce the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent. He would also apply this rate to pass-through businesses, so-called because their profits currently "pass through" the business and instead are taxed as their owner's ordinary income. These would include partnerships like law firms and investor groups, sole proprietorships, limited liability corporations (LLCs) and corporations with less than 100 shareholders. In its analysis of Trump’s tax plan, the Tax Foundation used both the 33 percent personal tax rate as well as the 15 percent pass-through business rate to assess the plan’s impact on individual taxpayers. The Tax Foundation found that, depending on which rate you apply and whether you factor in growth, the top 1 percent of taxpayers would see their after-tax incomes increase by 10.2 to 19.9 percent. Here’s a table breaking down Trump’s proposed tax cuts by income group: Similarly, the Tax Policy Center, which is affiliated with the Urban Institute, estimated that the top 1 percent would see a 13.5 percent gain in after-tax income. The think tank also said the Trump’s cuts would amount to about 2.6 percent of GDP, with 50.8 percent of the cuts going to the top 1 percent. In other words, the top 1 percent would see a tax break equivalent to about 1.32 percent of GDP. Clinton may actually be understating the gains the top 1 percent would receive under Trump. The Tax Foundation does not take into account one additional proposal that could affect the bottom line of many one percenters: eliminating the carried interest tax break. Currently, profits from investment funds can be taxed at a personal capital gains tax rate of 23.9 percent rather than the top marginal income rate of 39.6 percent. Taxing these lucrative earnings as ordinary income would raise about $18 billion over 10 years. While Trump’s plan calls for closing this loophole, it could also lower the tax rate since he’s proposing to tax pass-through businesses at a corporate tax rate of 15 percent — an 8.9 percentage point reduction from the current rate applied to hedge fund and private equity profits, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities noted. Our ruling Clinton said Trump’s tax plan will give the wealthy "more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two." After-tax incomes for the top 1 percent of taxpayers increased by 5.4 to 6.7 percent thanks to the Bush tax cuts. The same group would see incomes gains of 10.2 to 19.9 percent under the Trump tax plan, if not more. Measuring it in a different way, the top 1 percent received a tax break equivalent to 0.66 percent of GDP under Bush. Trump’s tax plan would deliver a cut equivalent to 1.32 percent of GDP.

pomt-15327	Says she "called for addressing risks of derivatives, cracking down on subprime mortgages and improving financial oversight" early on in the financial crisis.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/15/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-she-called-wall-street-regula/	Hillary Clinton has a reputation for being cozy with Wall Street -- but in her 2016 campaign, she’s been striking populist tones. Clinton introduced her plan for a variety of economic issues in a speech at the New School in Manhattan on July 14, 2015. As president, she said, she would go "beyond Dodd-Frank" -- the regulations on financial institutions that took hold in 2010, following the economic crisis of 2007-08. She said she had been calling for financial regulations since the very early stages of the crisis. "As we all know, in the years before the crash, financial firms piled risk upon risk, and regulators in Washington either couldn’t or wouldn’t keep up," she said. "I was alarmed by this gathering storm and called for addressing risks of derivatives, cracking down on subprime mortgages and improving financial oversight." Clinton used to be the senator from New York, the home of Wall Street. She has a history of campaign backing from the finance industry and of delivering high-priced speeches to finance firms, such as Goldman Sachs. And her husband, former President Bill Clinton, signed the repeal of a bank break-up bill, the Glass-Steagall Act -- a deregulation that some critics believe contributed to the financial crisis. So we questioned Hillary Clinton’s record of addressing financial regulations. Did she address derivatives, subprime mortgages and financial oversight so early in the crisis? The 2008 primary campaign While the financial crisis came to a head in summer 2008, problems with housing started to bubble up in 2007 during Clinton’s ill-fated presidential primary campaign. On the trail, Clinton addressed these nascent issues -- particularly the mortgage crisis -- as early as March of that year. Clinton, still a senator at the time, delivered a speech on the volatility of the subprime mortgage market on March 15, 2007. She said too many people were ignoring warning signs. "The subprime problems are now creating massive issues on Wall Street," Clinton said. "It's a serious problem affecting our housing market and millions of hard-working families." She gave specific proposals for addressing subprime mortgages, including expanding the role of the Federal Housing Administration, more borrowing options for underprivileged and first-time homebuyers, more safeguards against predatory lending practices and policies intended to prevent foreclosures. In August that year, she delivered a similar speech about dealing with problems from subprime mortgages. There, she reiterated earlier proposals, and also suggested laws establishing national standards and registration for loan brokers, as well as regulations on lenders. "I think the subprime market was sort of like the canary in the mine," she said. "You know, it was telling us loudly and clearly, ‘There are problems here.’ " It didn’t become law, but Clinton sponsored a bill to implement these policies in September 2007. The first time she mentioned derivatives was in a November 2007 speech in Iowa. (A derivative is a financial product that allows investors to hedge against price fluctuations in an underlying asset.) "We need to start addressing the risks posed by derivatives and other complex financial products," she said. "You can't let Wall Street send the bill to your street with the bright ideas that just don't work out. Derivatives and products like them are posing real risks to families, as Wall Street writes down tens of billions of dollars in investments. Companies are taking the loss of a billion here and a billion there simply because the securities they own are worth less than they thought." In the same speech, she spoke again of the risky lending that led to the subprime mortgage crisis, adding that she called on then-President George W. Bush to convene a conference to find a solution. And she also pushed for more oversight of financial markets: "So as president, I will move to establish the 21st-century oversight we need in a 21st-century global marketplace. I will call for an immediate review of these new investment products and for plans to make them more transparent." This November speech angered some of Clinton’s Wall Street donors, according to the New York Times. At the tail-end of her campaign, in March 2008 -- still before the financial crisis hit a peak later that summer -- Clinton released a six-point plan to increase financial regulation. The plan included, in part, more oversight of derivatives and other new financial products, establishment of mortgage standards and strengthened some consumer protections. After becoming secretary of state in 2009, Clinton made noticeably fewer comments on domestic policy and financial regulation. But the record shows that establishing policies to address the then-nascent financial crisis was a key point of her campaign platform in 2007 and 2008. Our ruling Clinton said she "called for addressing risks of derivatives, cracking down on subprime mortgages and improving financial oversight" early on in the financial crisis.

It worked. Now Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have changed their positions to follow Chris Dodd." Dodd is correct that his fellow candidates backed an amendment he co-sponsored. And it's likely that they felt some pressure from liberal Democrats -- including Dodd -- who strongly favor withdrawal. But Dodd exaggerates his role. He is just one of nine co-sponsors of the amendment widely called the Feingold-Reid amendment, usually without Dodd's name attached. And both Clinton and Obama have advocated other troop withdrawl proposals before endorsing this one. There's no evidence that Dodd had any influence on Obama and Clinton.

pomt-10012	"Tens of billions of dollars (from taxpayer-funded bailouts) ... flowed straight through AIG into the coffers of foreign corporations and foreign banks."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/mar/20/mike-pence/tens-billions-aig-bailout-went-foreign-comanies/	Amid all the furor over retention bonus payments to AIG employees, Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana, chair of the House Republican caucus, said another outrage in the AIG bailout saga isn't getting enough attention. "And the other unreported story today is tens of billions of dollars that flowed straight through AIG into the coffers of foreign corporations and foreign banks," Pence said in an interview on MSNBC on March 17. "You know, the American people are frustrated with this." To date, American taxpayers are $170 billion into AIG bailout as part of an effort to save the global insurance conglomerate from a collapse that many fear would have a catastrophic effect on the U.S. and global economies. But for months, AIG refused to say where that bailout money was going. Under mounting pressure from Congress, on March 15 AIG finally released the names of financial institutions that benefited from the rescue money. Although U.S. firms like Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Bank of America got the lion's share of payouts, the list also included a number of big foreign banks: Société Générale of France and Deutsche Bank of Germany, which each received nearly $12 billion; Barclays of Britain, $8.5 billion; and UBS of Switzerland, $5 billion. In all, corporations in France and Germany got nearly $36 billion; and all foreign companies got nearly $60 billion. So Pence is right, tens of billions of U.S. taxpayers dollars certainly flowed to foreign corporations and banks. But what did people expect? asked J.D. Foster, a senior fellow in the economics of fiscal policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation. AIG is a global company, indeed the largest insurance company in the world. Remember, Foster said, "the reason that AIG was taken over by the federal government was to prevent it from going into bankruptcy." It had a number of contractual obligations to both U.S. and foreign firms that it could not meet. "If (AIG executives) had made the decision that they were only going to pay U.S. companies, the foreign companies would have gone to court and put AIG in backruptcy," Foster said. "And the whole point was to keep them out of bankruptcy." "It’s understandable that people would be mad that taxpayer dollars would go to a place that you might not want it to go, to foreign corporations," he said. "(But) the only reason to give money to AIG was to close out its contracts. Some of those contracts are with foreign corporations." Pence isn't saying AIG should only have used taxpayer money to pay off obligations to U.S. companies. Pence doesn't think American taxpayers should have been paying for a bailout at all. Pence opposed the first rescue plan last fall, despite the urgings of President Bush and many key Republican leaders. Although a number of Republicans supported the bailout — enough for it to pass handily — Pence noted this week that a majority of Republicans in the House voted against it. "The American people have had it," Pence said in a news conference on March 17. "They want this Congress to get back to fiscal discipline and restraint and the belief that the freedom to succeed includes the freedom to fail. We have got to bring this country back, this business community back to the notion of personal responsibility and accountability for one's actions." There are reasoned arguments on both sides of whether Congress ought to have committed billions of taxpayer dollars to bailing out the troubled AIG. But the fact is, one of the consequences of infusing AIG with taxpayer cash to help it pay off its financial obligations was that tens of billions of that money went to foreign companies. We rule Pence's statement True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/91ae1e1f-21f9-41b0-9651-a7a0a0813f96	None	Mike Pence	None	None	None	2009-03-20T14:39:35	2009-03-17	['None']
pomt-11699	Wisconsin's state court agency "basically" has rented the same office space across from the Capitol "since 1974."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/dec/22/matt-adamczyk/one-wisconsin-state-agency-has-rented-space-same-b/	Jay Weber, a conservative talk show host on WISN-AM in Milwaukee, started a segment on his Dec. 15, 2017 show by bemoaning how much the State of Wisconsin "wastes" on rent for office space. He then introduced state Treasurer Matt Adamczyk, a Republican notable for campaigning on a pledge to work to eliminate the position. Adamczyk, who was elected in November 2014, argued that taxpayers are "getting ripped off" by the state renting space near the Capitol building, rather than buying buildings or building new ones. Giving one example, Adamczyk claimed the state courts agency "basically" has rented the same office space across from the state Capitol "since 1974." He’s correct -- even if it’s not clear that his implication, that the state is wasting money, is on target. The space Steve Michels, a spokesman for GOP Gov. Scott Walker’s Department of Administration, and Bob Lang, director of the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau, confirmed that the Director of State Courts office has leased space across from the Capitol, in the Tenney Plaza building at 110 E. Main St. in Madison, since 1974. The landlord is Tenney LLC. The owner is Urban Land Investments Inc. It’s been a bipartisan pattern. That span covers the administrations of eight governors -- four Democrats (Patrick Lucey, Martin Schreiber, Anthony Earl and Jim Doyle) and four Republicans (Lee Dreyfus, Tommy Thompson, Scott McCallum and Walker). Adamczyk provided lease documents showing that the Department of Administration most recently renewed the lease in January 2017. It’s a five-year lease, for 57,215 square feet, that started in October 2017. The first year’s rent is $1.35 million. With annual increases of 1.75 percent, the lease payment for the fifth year will be $1.45 million. A few points before we close: Lang and Michels told us that a renegotiation for the current lease produced a 23 percent reduction in the rent there, saving about $2.5 million. Adamczyk hasn’t spelled out where in a state-owned building the courts agency might go, what the savings might be and what other issues would come with owning rather than renting. As part of a separate branch of government, the courts agency generally has the authority to choose its own office space, Michels said. Our rating Railing against the state leasing office space as being too expensive, Adamczyk says the state courts agency "basically" has rented the same office space across from the Capitol "since 1974." He’s correct, although he doesn’t offer evidence indicating there is a viable alternative for the agency that would save money. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-02453	More than 80 percent of Georgians don’t support legislation to ease gun restrictions in houses of worship, in bars and on campuses.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2014/feb/26/mary-margaret-oliver/opposition-gun-bill-slightly-less-stated/	The Georgia House of Representatives recently passed legislation that would increase the types of places where guns could be allowed, but one lawmaker said most Georgians don’t support the changes. "You are aware of the polling data that dictates the views of people in relation to this gun debate," Georgia state Rep. Mary Margaret Oliver, D-Decatur, said during a floor debate concerning House Bill 875. "You are aware 80 percent-plus people don’t support these bills and these measures." One House member who supported the legislation questioned Oliver’s numbers. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether Oliver had accurately portrayed the people’s sentiments about the bill, or was she stretching the truth to win lawmakers to her side to vote against the bill. HB 875, written and co-sponsored by several Republican lawmakers, would lift restrictions on guns in houses of worship and bars, and allow school board members to arm themselves. It would no longer be a crime for licensed gun owners carrying a firearm on a college campus, where they are banned, under the legislation. Instead, the penalty would be a $100 fine. The bill does includes some restrictions, such as the mentally ill cannot get a gun license. Despite Oliver’s protestations, the House overwhelmingly passed the bill by a 119-56 margin. Like many contentious bills, the vote went along party lines, with nearly all Republicans voting in favor of the legislation and virtually all Democrats against it.The legislation is now in the hands of the Georgia Senate. Oliver said in her speech before fellow lawmakers that she asked people in her district how they felt about legislation that would expand gun rights in such fashion. Only 10 said they supported it while 156 said they opposed it. That, however, was not a scientific survey. Since Oliver’s district covers only a portion of DeKalb County, we wanted to know what information she had to support her claim concerning how voters statewide felt about legislation like HB 875. Oliver sent us a January poll by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that found 72 percent of registered voters statewide oppose allowing firearms in houses of worship, while 26 percent said they favored the idea. The remaining 2 percent either did not answer or were not sure how they felt about the idea. The question offered some interesting findings. Sixty-three percent of Republicans opposed the idea, while more than 90 percent of Democrats opposed it. A higher percentage of voters older than 65 were against the idea than those between the ages of 18 and 39. More than four out of five women said they were against allowing firearms in churches, while about 60 percent of men opposed the idea. The poll also asked how did people feel about allowing people to carry firearms on college campuses and in dorms. Seventy-eight percent said they oppose the idea. Again, it showed a higher percentage of women were against the idea than men. Again, it showed a larger percentage of older voters were against the idea than younger voters. Seventy-one percent of Republicans polled said they were against allowing firearms on college campuses. More than 90 percent of Democrats opposed the idea. The AJC poll surveyed 802 adults statewide between Jan. 6 and Jan. 9 on what issues Georgians want their Legislature to tackle in 2014. The margin of error for each response is plus or minus 4 percentage points. It was conducted by Abt SRBI of New York by live operators and included respondents via cellphone and land line. Oliver also sent us data from a poll conducted by Georgians for Gun Safety in 2010. It showed 76 percent of the respondents felt the state "definitely should not" allow anyone with a gun permit to carry a firearm into a house of worship. An additional 10 percent said Georgia "probably should not" allow gun permit holder to carry in a house of worship. The Georgians for Gun Safety poll also asked for the public’s opinion about allowing people to carry firearms onto a college campus. Sixty-four percent responded "definitely should not" while an additional 12 percent answered "probably should not." In 2013, Atlanta’s NBC affiliate, 11 Alive, polled Georgians on the topic. It found 64 percent thought it should "remain unlawful" for firearms to be carried into churches. Twenty-six percent supported the idea. Sixty-five percent of those who responded to the poll said the law should be illegal to carry firearms on college campuses. To sum up, Oliver said more than 80 percent of Georgians do not support measures like those proposed in House Bill 875. Most of the polling data we reviewed shows a majority of Georgians oppose firearms in houses of worship or on college campuses. But there’s not much data that we saw that surpasses the 80 percent mark. Oliver’s overall point that most Georgians oppose firearms in bars, on campus or in houses of worship is on the mark. But her specific percentage is too high, and she used the number to pursue a specific political point. We rate Oliver’s claim Half True.

pomt-11174	The Mueller investigation is "soon to be $20,000,000."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/23/donald-trump/mueller-probe-costing-20-million-donald-trump-says/	President Donald Trump has criticized the special counsel investigation headed by Robert Mueller on a variety of grounds. In a recent tweet, he took it to task for its price tag. On May 20, he tweeted: "At what point does this soon to be $20,000,000 Witch Hunt, composed of 13 Angry and Heavily Conflicted Democrats and two people who have worked for Obama for 8 years, STOP! They have found no Collussion with Russia, No Obstruction, but they aren’t looking at the corruption..." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Trump’s tweet caught our eye, because it doubled his estimate of the Mueller probe’s cost from $10 million just five days earlier. Trump echoed a comment by one of his lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, that pegged the figure at $20 million. Is the Mueller probe really approaching $20 million? It does if you use the most aggressive accounting method. (The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) Looking at direct costs only The Mueller investigation is being funded through mandatory spending, which essentially means it is set up to be free of executive branch influence. However, Justice Department officials do have a degree of oversight to make sure that money isn’t wasted, as with any other department office. Mueller’s office has released one accounting of its expenses so far. The report was released in December 2017, and it covered the first four and a half months of the probe, from May 17-Sept. 30, 2017. According to the report, the Mueller investigation spent $3.2 million directly during that period. The biggest category was $1.7 million for staff salaries and benefits, while the second-largest was for equipment. Smaller categories included travel, rent, utilities and supplies. If you prorate that amount out to a full year—the approximate length of the investigation at the time Trump sent his tweet — it would come to about $8.5 million spent so far. That’s well below the $20 million Trump cited. As it happens, Congress and the White House projects that the Mueller investigation will be racking up costs at an even faster clip than what has been reported so far. The special counsel’s office is officially budgeted for $10.4 million in direct costs for fiscal year 2018 (running from Oct. 1, 2017, to Sept. 30, 2018), and the Trump administration has earmarked another $10.4 million in its budget request for fiscal year 2019 (running from Oct. 1, 2018 to Sept. 30, 2019). If the investigation ends up spending at this pace, it’s possible that it could eventually surpass $20 million in direct costs. That would be speculative, however, because that would occur months in the future, and because we don’t know whether the investigation will keep spending money at the same rate. Adding in indirect costs Using a different accounting method, however, the $20 million projected cost isn’t implausible. A footnote in the report says that the investigation has also incurred $3.5 million in indirect costs, a category it says is "neither legally required" for disclosure nor reported in filings by previous special counsels. Mueller’s office argues that these indirect expenses don’t amount to additional taxpayer expenditures, since these resources — especially personnel, such as employees of the FBI or other agencies — would have been devoted to other cases if there had been no special counsel investigation. However, if you do count the indirect expenses, the total comes to $6.7 million spent during those first four and a half months. Prorated to cover the investigation’s full first year, the total of direct and indirect expenses reaches $17.9 million. That's not too far off from $20 million. Here’s a summary of what’s been spent by, authorized for, and requested for the Mueller investigation so far: Fiscal year Start date End Date Direct spending Indirect spending Total spent Authorized (direct only) Requested (direct only) 2017 May 17, 2017 Sept. 30, 2017 $3.2 million $3.5 million $6.7 million $3.9 million -- 2018 Oct. 1, 2017 Sept. 30, 2018 Not yet reported Not yet reported Not yet reported $10.4 million -- 2019 Oct. 1, 2018 Sept. 30, 2019 -- -- -- -- $10.4 million How does the Mueller investigation compare historically? The investigation of President Bill Clinton over Whitewater and Monica Lewinsky — headed by Kenneth Starr and then by his successor, Robert Ray — cost upward of $52 million over half a decade. Another $40 million-plus went toward a handful of other Clinton-era independent counsel investigations. Meanwhile, the investigation of Reagan administration officials over the Iran-Contra Affair, headed by Lawrence Walsh, topped out at more than $47 million over a roughly similar period. Those figures are direct costs only, and are not adjusted for inflation. Their price tags would be far higher when converted to 2018 dollars. Our ruling Trump tweeted that the Mueller investigation will soon be $20 million. Officially, it’s not costing that much. Counting direct costs only, as Justice Department and executive branch accounting rules specify, the investigation’s first year cost an estimated $8.5 million, assuming Mueller’s team continued to spend at the same rate it did for the first four and a half months. (It could be months before we have updated figures.) However, with the addition of indirect costs, the first year would be expected to cost a prorated $17.9 million, which is within shouting distance of the $20 million Trump cited.

pomt-09973	The Republican Party has "21 percent party ID and shrinking."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/06/democratic-national-committee/republican-party-identification-shrinking/	Democrats are still celebrating over Sen. Arlen Specter's party switch from Republican to Democrat — and are mocking the Republicans about it. Their latest Web ad is a spoof of the television show Survivor , showing a parade of Republican leaders and asking, "Which one will win the battle for the heart and soul of the GOP?" The ad was inspired by an op-ed that Republican moderate Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine wrote for the New York Times, lamenting what she sees as the Republican Party's hostile attitude to moderates. "It is true that being a Republican moderate sometimes feels like being a cast member of Survivor — you are presented with multiple challenges, and you often get the distinct feeling that you’re no longer welcome in the tribe," Snowe wrote. "But it is truly a dangerous signal that a Republican senator of nearly three decades no longer felt able to remain in the party." The DNC's ad starts with that quote, then shows a parade of Republican leaders identified by their first names. There's Mitt (Romney, former governor of Massachusetts); John B. (John Boehner, the House minority leader); Sarah (Palin, the governor of Alaska); Karl (Rove, political adviser to George W. Bush) and more. The ad concludes with Rush Limbaugh. The video is really just an effort to mock Republican leaders. But one checkable fact stood out to us: "21 percent party ID and shrinking," meaning that the GOP now has only 21 percent of the electorate, and that figure is declining. To find out the facts, we have to turn to polls for how people cited their party because some states don't require voters to declare an affiliation. Two nonpartisan polling organizations, the Gallup Polls and Pew Research Center for People and the Press, released polling data on party identification close to the same time the DNC ad was released. Gallup found 28 percent identified as Republicans, while Pew counted it at 23 percent. To broaden the picture, we turned to the Web site Pollster.com The site creates data models that aggregate many polls, with an eye toward more accurate results. The site lists an NBC poll at 20 percent and one from the Associated Press at 18 percent, but most are above the 21 percent cited by the Democrats. Using the range numbers, Pollster.com calculated an overall estimate of 26.4 percent. So the Democrats are cherry-picking the low end. The next question is whether Republican registrations are declining. The ad doesn't give a time frame. Both the Gallup and Pew polls show declines since roughly 2005. Gallup has recorded a decline in Republican Party identification from about 35 percent in 2005 to 28 percent in 2009. Pew showed a decline from 30 percent in 2004 to 23 percent in 2009. During similar time frames, Democrats have seen small upticks or been flat. Pew showed independents increasing from 30 percent in 2004 to 36 percent in 2009. So the DNC is right that the number of voters identifying themselves as Republicans has been declining. But 21 percent is from the low end of accepted estimates. So we rate their statement Mostly True.	None	Democratic National Committee	None	None	None	2009-05-06T16:22:52	2009-05-05	['None']
pomt-07113	State Sen. Alberta Darling "voted to add more than $1 billion in additional spending" while cutting programs such as education and health care	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jun/20/sandy-pasch/wisconsin-rep-sandy-pasch-says-sen-alberta-darling/	As Republicans moved to aggressively cut the two-year state budget in the spring of 2011, state Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, praised the move to smaller government and no new taxes. Meanwhile, state Rep. Sandy Pasch, a Democrat from Milwaukee’s North Shore, fought against the cuts, in particular pushing to save funds for SeniorCare, the state’s drug assistance program for some residents over 65. Now Pasch is running in a recall election against Darling, co-chair of the Legislature’s budget-writing Joint Finance Committee. Little surprise she would target Darling’s work on the budget, which makes controversial cuts in education and aid to local governments to close a more than $3 billion shortfall. Here’s the twist: Pasch argues the final product makes "a mockery of Senator Darling's claims of fiscal responsibility." "Voters in our district would be stunned to learn that all the while Senator Darling is talking about getting the budget under control, she actually voted to add more than $1 billion in additional spending," Pasch said in a campaign news release. Campaign watchers will see this claim repeated by Democrats in this summer’s recall elections. Already state Rep. Fred Clark, D-Baraboo, has launched a similar attack against Sen. Luther Olsen, R-Ripon. Indeed, both sides are working overtime to put their spin on the budget -- and doing it in some head-spinning ways. Democrats are hammering their rivals about all the budget cuts, while simultaneously criticizing efforts Republicans made to soften some of the cuts. Republicans are touting their fiscal responsibility but also want credit for adding back some spending to ease some of Walker’s proposals. Let’s look at Pasch’s claim of a $1 billion spending increase. Is it true? Pasch’s campaign pointed us to the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau’s accounting of the work of the Joint Finance Committee. The committee, with members of both parties and both chambers, is the first stop for the budget, which won final approval June 16, 2011. The fiscal bureau scored it this way: The 2011-’13 budget approved by the committee with Darling’s support was $1.1 billion higher than the budget of former Gov. Jim Doyle. That’s including all state and federal funds in the budget, for a 1.8 percent increase. But there are other ways to look at it. The committee’s starting point was not Doyle’s last budget, as Pasch’s statement implies, but the newly crafted budget for 2011-’13 from Walker, who had built in a 1 percent spending increase. When you look at what the committee added compared with the Walker starting point, the figure is much lower -- $528 million, according to the fiscal bureau. That was possible largely because of revised revenue forecasts, that increased the amount the state is expected to take in. In any case, both the $528 million and the $1.1 billion figures are appropriate and commonly used, depending on what point is being made, said Bob Lang, director of the fiscal bureau. And Capitol reporters -- including those from the Journal Sentinel -- have long measured increases by comparing the new budget to the previous year’s budget. That’s the $1.1 billion difference. In the end, the committee did not go back to Doyle’s budget or even stay with the level of spending Walker introduced. So Pasch’s claim about the increase seems to be on target. But there is this caveat, unmentioned by Pasch: According to the fiscal bureau, $154 million of the spending increase stemmed from late-breaking estimates of higher enrollment in state Medicaid programs. The fiscal bureau itself suggested that add-back as an option. What about the second part of Pasch’s claim -- that Darling, while putting in "additional spending," backed major cuts in education and cuts to SeniorCare? This one’s a bit more complicated. Darling did back the Joint Finance Committee version of the budget that left intact the bulk of Walker’s plans. For example, local school aids dropped by nearly $800 million. So Darling supported most of Walker’s dramatic cutbacks. But she didn’t support them in total. It’s worth noting the cut in local school aids would have been $116 million higher but for action by Darling and her committee. And on SeniorCare, Darling and the Republicans bucked Walker and kept SeniorCare in its current form. The Pasch news release, though, hits Darling for cutting SeniorCare. In short: Some of the "additional spending" that Pasch attacks was more or less forced by events (the Medicaid piece) and some involved two issues where Pasch simultaneously criticized Darling for cutting back. Darling’s campaign estimated that about $140 million of the funds that Joint Finance added back to the budget went for things Democrats wanted restored. What’s the bottom line? Trying to turn Darling’s claims of fiscal austerity against her, Pasch contended that her opponent actually had voted for a budget that increased state spending by more than $1 billion. And that she did it while cutting key programs such as education and health care. The $1 billion figure is a real number. And Darling backed many major cutbacks. But Pasch’s statement needed some clarification and additional information -- including that some of the $1 billion went to ease the cuts in programs Pasch simultaneously accused Darling of gutting. We rate her statement Mostly True.	None	Sandy Pasch	None	None	None	2011-06-20T09:00:00	2011-06-14	['None']
pomt-06240	Says Barack Obama promised to halve the deficit in his first term.	true	/texas/statements/2011/dec/02/matt-mackowiak/Republican-consultant-Barack-Obama-promise-deficit/	Republican consultant Matt Mackowiak casts the 2012 presidential race as a tilt between Republicans for limited government and Democrats pushing expanded government. In an opinion article published Dec. 1, 2011, in the Austin American-Statesman, Mackowiak says President Barack Obama "has talked a good game about deficit reduction, but his actions have demonstrated a clear disregard for record deficits and our $15 trillion debt." And his piece includes this checkable claim: "Obama promised to halve the deficit by the end of his first term. He didn't." The annual deficit, meaning the difference between what the government is spending and what it’s raising from taxes and other sources, has grown on Obama’s watch. According to a White House historical table, the deficit was $458.6 billion in 2008, the year he won election. It reached $1.4 trillion in 2009, a year over which he and his predecessor, George W. Bush, both held budgetary sway. The deficit was nearly $1.3 trillion in 2010. And according to a November 2011 report by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, the deficit was also $1.3 trillion for fiscal 2011, which ran through September 2011. And did the Democratic president promise to cut the deficit in half? Bingo. PolitiFact noted in a June 2011 fact check that Obama said at a "fiscal responsibility" summit at the White House in February 2009: "I'm pledging to cut the deficit we inherited by half by the end of my first term in office." Obama continued: "Now, this will not be easy. It will require us to make difficult decisions and face challenges we've long neglected. But I refuse to leave our children with a debt that they cannot repay, and that means taking responsibility right now, in this administration, for getting our spending under control." Earlier in his remarks, Obama said his administration had "inherited a $1.3 trillion deficit—the largest in our nation's history." After making his pledge, Obama said the budget he would soon propose "will look ahead 10 years and will include a full and honest accounting of the money we plan to spend and the deficits we will likely incur. To start reducing these deficits, I've committed to going through our budget line by line to root out waste and inefficiency." Obama went on to say he was intent on restoring pay-as-you-go budgeting and also ending the "payments to agribusiness that don't need them and eliminate the no-bid contracts that have wasted billions in Iraq. We'll end the tax breaks for companies shipping jobs overseas," he said, "and we'll stop the fraud and abuse in our Medicare program." We rate Mackowiak’s statement True.

pomt-08870	Republican candidate for governor "Karen Handel has run a 100 percent negative campaign."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2010/aug/04/nathan-deal/nathan-deal-says-karen-handel-running-negative-cam/	Once again, a contender in the Republican runoff for governor has launched a negative attack. The reason? His opponent has gone too negative, he said. The campaign of former U.S. Rep. Nathan Deal of Gainesville launched its assault in a news release Friday. It said former Secretary of State Karen Handel has run "a 100 percent negative campaign. Not one all-positive mail piece or TV ad." The Handel camp disagrees. Portions of its mailers are positive, a spokesman said. The remainder are "contrasts" that accurately compare her with her opponents. Plus, Deal's campaign has done its share of attacks. The winner of the Aug. 10 runoff will go on to face former Gov. Roy Barnes, a Democrat, during the general election in November. So has Handel really run a "100 percent negative campaign"? Deal's camp produced four Handel mailers and two TV commercials as evidence. This item reviews each of them but does not assess whether the attacks are true. "Solid" Handel's campaign launched the "Solid" TV ad for the runoff against Deal. "One carries a purse," an announcer says over images of a green purse and Handel. "The other carries baggage," he continues. A black-and-white image of Deal appears next to a moneybag. Quotes about Deal using the words "corrupt" and "scandal" zip across the screen. At one point, it calls Deal "a corrupt relic of Washington, D.C." Negative. "Investigation Journal" This four-page runoff mailer looks like a magazine. The title "Investigation Journal" runs across its cover near a photo of Deal. "Nathan Deal's Corruption Probed," it says. "Back Room Deals, Million Dollar Payments and Resignation from Congress." The remainder reviews news accounts of accusations that Deal violated ethics rules. Negative. "Lipstick" This 30-second spot ran during the Republican primary. The attacks take place in the ad's first 12 seconds. "Three who have iffy ethics. One who wears lipstick," it begins. Three black-and-white smiles appear on the screen next to a pair of red lips. "Three who look after themselves. One who looks after you," the announcer continues. The black-and-white smiles transform into photos of Handel's opponents in the primary, Insurance Commissioner John Oxendine, state Sen. Eric Johnson and Deal, next to a smiling pair of red lips. Negative. "Three Who Look Out for Themselves, Only One Who Looks Out for Us" The title of this four-page primary mailer is self-explanatory. It attacks the same opponents that she did in the "Lipstick" ad. A chart comparing the candidates says they all have ethics problems and were previously Democrats, among other things. Negative. "Fulton County's Own Karen Handel Stands Up Against Corruption ... While her Opponents are Politics as Usual" This four-page primary mailer attacks the same three candidates. Although two pages are mainly devoted to her campaign promises and records, the front and back covers are attacks on her opponents and accusations that they behaved unethically. Mostly negative, with some positive portions. "Georgia Conservative" This eight-page primary mailer, which also looks like a magazine, is mostly positive. The cover touts her conservative credentials, life story and business history. Two pages detail her personal, business and political records. Two discuss her platform. But the next two are once again attacks on Republican primary candidates that repeat accusations from other attack mailers. The back cover calls her opponents "good-ole-boys." Mostly positive, with some negative portions. So where does this leave us? PolitiFact Georgia asked Handel's camp for wholly positive mailers to counter Deal's claim, but it produced none. Her camp's defense is that what Deal's campaign said are negative attacks are actually "comparisons" between her and her opponents. Still, they are negative comparisons. So the Deal campaign's claim that none of her mailers or TV ads are completely positive is correct. Now labeling anything "100 percent" anything is trouble. Significant portions of two of her mailers are positive. In addition, Handel's campaign website, which the Deal campaign's accusation didn't mention in its claim, contains positive elements as well as attacks. Plus, Deal's campaign doesn't smell like roses. For instance, one TV ad, "How Can We Trust Karen Handel on Anything?", accuses Handel of telling "lies" about Deal but doesn't say what they are. A mailer accuses her of a "record of gay activism" that social conservatives would oppose. The claim that Handel has run "a 100 percent negative campaign" is an attack in itself. And the fact remains that both of Handel's TV ads are negative, and the majority of pages in Handel's mailers are focused on attacks. While Deal's campaign paid too little attention to the positive elements of her campaign, the overall impression its statement gives is true. Handel's campaign is negative. We rule Deal's accusation Mostly True.	None	Nathan Deal	None	None	None	2010-08-04T06:00:00	2010-07-30	['Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-10793	"A lot of people don't know that 50,000 Americans now make their living off eBay."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/09/john-mccain/going-going--probably-wrong/	John McCain might be right, but we don't think so. McCain's campaign didn't return repeated calls and e-mails to confirm where the 50,000 number came from. But it clearly didn't come from eBay. "We're not exactly sure where he got the number. We don't even calculate according to the U.S.," said eBay spokeswoman Deanna Monestero. "I don't want to say it's wrong, but I can't trace it." The latest figures for the U.S. date back to 2005, when an A.C. Nielsen study revealed 724,000 Americans used eBay to make some money. But the survey didn't break down the number to figure out how many were just making a few bucks compared with the number making a living on eBay. Back in 2003, a similar survey found that 430,000 Americans made all or some of their income from the internet auction site. But once again, the survey didn't break down the "all" and "some" income numbers. That same year, Jim Griffith, who is eBay's so-called "dean of education" (who knew there was one?), was quoted in a Colorado newspaper as saying, "More than 20,000 people earn their living selling on eBay in the United States." But a company spokeswoman couldn't say where that number came from, either. These days, the company only keeps track of eBay entrepreneurs worldwide. That number, based on a 2006 Nielsen study, is estimated at 1.3-million. But again, it doesn't distinguish between full-time and part-time on-line auctioneers. The bottom line: Lots of people make money on eBay, but how many depend on it to pay their bills remains unclear.

pomt-04639	"We just don't want to get to be like Louisiana, where you have drive-up daiquiri shops."	true	/oregon/statements/2012/sep/13/bill-kennemer/are-there-daiquiri-drive-thrus-louisiana/	Oregon is a control state. Not only does the state regulate the consumption of all alcohol, but the state buys, stores and sells distilled spirits to retailers and consumers. That may change, with rumblings Thursday of a citizens’ initiative to loosen our uptight liquor laws if lawmakers don’t in 2013. Some legislators appeared reluctant to follow Washington state in privatizing liquor sales, as reported in a three-part series published in The Oregonian this week. State Rep. Bill Kennemer told a reporter: "We just don't want to get to be like Louisiana, where you have drive-up daiquiri shops." PolitiFact Oregon wondered if perhaps Kennemer had first-hand knowledge to back up his bold statement. Because anyone who’s grown up on the West Coast and has not traveled to the South knows there’s no such thing as ordering a cocktail to go, especially from behind the wheel. (PolitiFact Oregon knows someone who knows someone who tried to order a takeaway gin-and-tonic from a San Francisco bar but was rejected, even though the person was on foot!) It turns out, Kennemer did have direct knowledge. In an interview, he explained he was driving around the New Orleans area with his wife, Cherie, one recent summer and they kept spotting these signs for daiquiris. The signs were attached to buildings with drive-thru windows. Blended frozen daiquiris are made with rum, lime juice and sweetener and have the consistency of iced smoothies. They come in many fruity flavors, plus chocolate. "So after seeing this and being tempted multiple times," he said, "and thinking what in the world could this possibly be, we drove into one and ended up ordering daiquiris." PolitiFact Oregon: Did you order the drinks and then drive off? Kennemer (small voice): "I’m afraid we did." So there’s your evidence. Still, we understand that readers may want legal proof of proofed drinks to-go by vehicle, other than the word of a visiting legislator. For that, we contacted Jacques Berry, a spokesman for the Louisiana lieutenant governor’s office. Berry couldn’t tell us how many such drive-thrus dot the South Louisiana landscape, but he verified that a person doesn’t usually have to go far to find one. For locals, it’s a popular frozen treat on a Friday afternoon. "It’s not as much of a late-night thing," he said. And why the daiquiri, in particular? Well, Berry thinks it has to do with New Orleans bartenders mixing the ingredients that were plentiful and on hand, in this case, fresh fruit, rum and ice. The drinks caught on. Donnie Silva, owner of Big Easy Bachelor Parties in New Orleans, says he thinks the blended drinks are popular because of the climate. He was in Las Vegas recently when he says, "I really wanted a daiquiri. I guess it’s just the heat, we really don’t have a winter. Fifteen of the last 25 Christmases I’ve been in shorts and a T-shirt." Which is an utterly foreign concept to Oregonians. As foreign as the daiquiri drive-thru. (Technically, Louisiana does not allow open containers in vehicles. The way it works is that an attendant hands you a drink and a straw and what you do with those two objects is up to you. Also, in some states, you can buy packaged liquor and beer through a drive-thru window. ) We realize Kennemer is citing an extreme example, and that’s fine, but we should also remind readers that loosening our liquor laws won’t necessarily turn us into Louisiana. California has liquor stores that any kid can enter to buy a pack of gum. And still you can’t get a decent frozen daiquiri to go, by car, or a gin and tonic, by foot. We rate the statement True.

pomt-04791	Says U.S. Senate hopeful Tammy Baldwin voted for a $1 trillion stimulus bill that included a wasteful "$800,000 to replace light bulbs."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/aug/23/crossroads-gps/crossroads-gps-says-baldwin-voted-spend-800000-rep/	On Day 1 of Wisconsin’s general election contest for an open U.S. Senate seat, Democrat Tammy Baldwin got a scolding from a conservative advocacy group. "Big spending in Washington is terrible for Wisconsin’s economy, and Tammy Baldwin hasn’t helped," a Crossroads GPS TV ad began. "Tammy Baldwin voted for the failed $1 trillion stimulus, including projects like $800,000 to replace light bulbs." The ad includes an image of a standard-issue light bulb, the kind you might have in your living room, and goes on to rip Baldwin, a Democrat from Madison, for trillions being added to the national debt during her 13-plus years in Congress. We’ve heard a lot of claims over the years about stimulus spending. But a wasteful $800,000 for light bulbs? The stimulus bill Baldwin did vote for the stimulus package, known formally as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in 2009. But it did not carry a $1 trillion price tag at the time. The 2009 estimate was $787 billion and later revised to $814 billion. Interest costs on additional debt will bring it over $1 trillion, but Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said it’s somewhat misleading to pin that figure on Baldwin. So the ad is a bit shaky on the big picture. Light bulbs Now let’s try to shed some light on the claim of a wasteful $800,000 in stimulus funds to "replace light bulbs." Crossroads GPS pointed us to a November 9, 2011, online story by WITI-TV (Channel 6) in Milwaukee that focused on stimulus-funded projects that, in the words of the story, weren’t "exactly stimulating much of anything." The story said the U.S. Department of Energy had "showered" the city of Racine with nearly $800,000 in stimulus money, which Racine used to replace street lights with energy efficient LED lights. But, the story said, only one unemployed electrician was needed to install the lights. So, while the ad leaves the impression these are ordinary light bulbs, that’s far from the case. As in many other U.S. cities, the Racine money came through the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant program. At least 30 cities asked for more than $104 million in federal stimulus funds to help them change to LED (light-emitting diodes), replacing high-pressure sodium lights, USA Today reported in March 2009. Racine’s total grant was $795,000, but not all of it was for the street lights. A good chunk of it -- about $194,000 -- was for energy audits of homes and loans to residents who wanted to save money through weatherization and other energy-saving changes. Another $79,500 was for administration. A total of $521,500 was for the new LED lights, with about half for street lights and half for city government buildings, according to Kathleen Fischer, the city’s assistant finance director. So the Crossroads ad is off on the $800,000 claim as well. The installation did only result in enough work for one full-time electrician, according to Racine Mayor John Dickert. But there are a couple other aspects to this. First, Racine is saving 59 percent on energy costs thanks to the lights. That is projected to amount to about $40,000 a year. "It was money well spent," said Mark Yehlen, commissioner of Public Works. "We have realized significant savings." What’s more, one of the primary suppliers of LED lights for the Racine project was a Racine-area company, Ruud Lighting, that builds the lights. Ruud has expanded and added jobs while winning contracts to supply LED lights all over the United States to municipalities -- many of them using the federal stimulus dollars flowing through the Department of Energy’s block grant program. "BetaLED, a division of Ruud Lighting, Inc., is seeing a healthy boost in business as cities tap into their Recovery Act funds...", a Department of Energy news release said in April 2010. When Ruud was purchased by Cree Inc. in 2011 and announced job-expansion plans, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker praised the company and said Ruud would be eligible for up to $4 million in state tax credits. For years, many of the LED conversions involved lights mostly made in Asia, though the lights often were assembled in the United States, PolitiFact National and FactCheck.org found in previous fact checks. That was because the Energy Department initially felt insufficient components were available domestically. Ruud has won some contracts because it uses more American-made parts than other companies, according to news coverage in Pittsburgh, where it also won work, though not through stimulus funding. "These ads are really disappointing," said Dickert, the Racine mayor. "They are only telling half the story, if that." Our rating Crossroads GPS charges that Baldwin voted for wasteful spending through a "$1 trillion stimulus" plan, specifically citing "$800,000 to replace light bulbs." On both counts, the numbers are too high. While only one job was created to complete the project, city officials say it will save city taxpayers money every year and a growing local company got a big chunk of the contract to make the lights. They are in the midst of a hiring effort and have won stimulus-funded work all over the country. There’s an element of truth in that federal stimulus money went to buy light bulbs, but overall we rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-07828	"The alternative" to higher state worker pension and health care payments "is to look at 1,500 layoffs of state employees or close to 200,000 children who would be bumped off Medicaid-related programs."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/15/scott-walker/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-says-alternative-state-/	Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has rocked the state Capitol with a host of proposals that would affect state employees, including requiring them to pay more toward their pensions and health care. Those two moves, part of a budget repair bill introduced Feb. 14, 2011, would raise nearly $30 million. The Republican-controlled Legislature has the measure on the fastest of tracks, and could approve it in under a week. Raising $30 million would be a big step toward meeting a $137 million budget shortfall before the 2010-2011 budget year ends June 30, 2011 -- and help reduce a larger gap in the next two-year budget. In pitching his proposal for the higher pension and health care payments at a Feb. 11, 2011, news conference, Walker presented a stark picture of the options he has: "The alternative in this budget alone, in fiscal year 2011, is to look at 1,500 layoffs of state employees or close to 200,000 children who would be bumped off Medicaid-related programs." As governor, Walker certainly has the power to lay off state workers. But can he remove children from Medicaid, the state-federal program that pays medical bills for low-income individuals and families? To back up the statement, Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie provided a Feb. 8 memo from the state Department of Health Services. It says spending $30 million over three months provides BadgerCare, a Medicaid program, to 194,539 Wisconsin children. That supports the numbers. But the memo says nothing about whether the state has the authority to cut kids from the Medicaid program. We asked Walker directly whether the state has such power. "Well, that’s what the equivalent would be," the governor replied. "That’s just one option. The more immediate one -- if I had to, I don’t want to do any of them -- would be the 1,500 layoffs. But that’s what the equivalent cost is." OK, we understand that removing nearly 200,000 kids from Medicaid would save $30 million over three months, but could the state do that? "Again, we just picked out numbers in terms of equivalent dollar amounts," Walker said. "I literally did not even go through the mechanics of that because I’m planning on doing what’s in this bill, not the alternatives." We looked at the mechanics by consulting several experts: Jon Peacock, research director of the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families Joan Alker, co-executive director of Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families Kaiser Family Foundation, a national research organization that focuses on health care (memo) The Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau’s memo on Walker’s budget-repair bill They all agreed: The federal health care reform law that took effect in March 2010 prohibits states, until at least 2019, from changing their Medicaid eligibility requirements for children. In other words, states can’t take Medicaid away from kids who are receiving it. In fact, if a state did cut kids, it would forgo all federal Medicaid funding, according to a Center for Children and Families memo. That would be significant, as Wisconsin spent $6.7 billion last year in federal and state money on Medicaid for children and adults. "I think when you’re discussing how to balance your (budget) choices that you ought to make comparisons of actual options," Peacock said. Let’s review. Walker said that if his proposal for state employees to pay more for their benefits is not adopted, alternatives such as removing nearly 200,000 children from Medicaid would have to be considered. But that’s a phony alternative. Legally, the state does not have the option to remove kids from Medicaid; Walker acknowledged he did not check before making the statement. We rate Walker’s statement on Medicaid and kids False.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2011-02-15T15:31:44	2011-02-11	['None']
pomt-07393	Says it probably costs more than $300,000 to run for a seat on the Pedernales Electric Cooperative board of directors.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2011/may/02/troy-fraser/state-senator-says-it-probably-costs-more-300000-r/	State Sen. Troy Fraser, who’s been in the thick of years-long tussling regarding the Pedernales Electric Cooperative, wants co-op directors elected from regional single-member districts. Pitching legislation mandating that change, the Horseshoe Bay Republican noted the expense of seeking election via at-large balloting open to the co-op’s entire membership. Fraser told the Senate Committee on Business & Commerce on April 19: "If you’re a person that lives, let’s say, in Marble Falls and you want to run, you’ve got to... solicit the support of 210,000 people, probably costing in excess of $300,000 to run for a co-op board, which is a little absurd." Ka-ching. Is his claim on the money? In an interview, Fraser pointed out that each of the seven Pedernales directors is elected by the co-op’s 200,000-plus members, spread across a 24-county region. In contrast, Texas House members represent about 139,000 residents each. Fraser told us his cost estimate presumes a board candidate would send at least one mailing to every co-op member, at a minimum cost of $1 per recipient so a single mass mailing would cost more than $200,000. He said candidates also spend money on items such as websites. But what do campaign spending reports for Pedernales director candidates show? Turns out there are none. The state does not require them because the co-op is not a government entity. For his part, Fraser referred to Texas House candidate campaign spending tallies indicating that into October 2010, the least costly winning House campaign had cost about $296,300.The most costly campaign--which did not end in victory--had cost more than $1.2 million. Fraser drew the spending figures from a Texas Tribune chart published in November. The chart, limited to candidates in contested races, totaled spending from July 2009 through Oct. 23, 2010 -- hence understating how much candidates likely spent through the November general election. And according to the chart, Nueces County Republican Raul Torres spent $296,284 through Oct. 23 on his way to victory while Democrat Patrick Rose of Dripping Springs spent $1.2 million in his re-election try. Using the same chart, we later identified more than 50 House winners who spent less than Torres through Oct. 23, though many of the lightest spenders faced only third-party challengers. Re-elected GOP Rep. Susan King, on her way to besting a Libertarian and Independent, spent the least: $30,995. Among victors with major-party opponents, Republican John V. Garza, who unseated Democratic Rep. David Leibowitz, had spent $72,583. When we inquired into the cost of past board campaigns, PEC spokeswoman Anne Harvey encouraged us to contact candidates directly. We emailed or left telephone messages with the 13 candidates for two board seats last year, asking how much they spent on what. Among defeated hopefuls, Ken Rigsbee saId he spent $2,700 of his own money traveling around, Dan Pedersen said he spent around $1,000 on yard signs, T-shirts and advertising and Ted Lehr said he spent less than $500. At the low end, Thornton Keel said he spent a small sum to buy a list of co-op members. Geoffrey Vanderpal and Bob Driscoll each said he spent no money. More detail from losing candidates:: --Steven Carriker said he spent $2,000 almost exclusively on newspaper ads. He said too that a group that backed him, Clean Water Action, sent out 4,000 postcards, perhaps costing $2,000. David Foster, state program director for Clean Water Action in Texas, told us in an interview that for the annual board races in 2008 through 2010, the group spent $15,000 on postcards listing its preferred candidates that were mailed to the group’s 7,000 members in the co-op's service area. It also reached members electronically and by phone. Carriker said he doesn’t think a shift to 30,000-resident districts, as Fraser proposes, would change much: "I recognize (due to first-hand experience) the formidable task of communicating successfully with 200,000 other members, (but) it is hardly a less formidable task to communicate with even one-seventh that number." --Joe Summy said: "I had little money, less than $3,000 and had to depend on volunteers and word of mouth." As for Fraser’s $300,000 figure, he said, "I have no way to confirm that number." Summy’s email continued: "However, unless a candidate has the backing of special interest groups and/or political parties the common candidate has little chance of winning....especially when only 10-12 percent of the (co-op) members vote. in the 2010 races, 20,727 co-op members voted, according to results made public by the co-op at the board’s June 28 meeting. "The PEC area is over 8,000 square miles. Five of the six candidates have won" in elections since 2009 "because they had the support of various special-interest groups" which "want to maintain the at-large system because any candidate with their support has a tremendous advantage," Summy said. "The system now has been established to keep a certain elite in power." As for successful candidates: --Chris Perry, who won the District 4 seat, said he spent less than $1,000 of his own money, mostly for a website, leaflets and travel. He said he did not seek or accept donations, but fielded endorsements "from a variety of individuals and organizations but I have no idea what they may have spent or what they may have done to support me, other than notifying their friends or members of their endorsement." Perry said: "I don’t know anyone who would" spend $300,000-plus. "It would be an outrageous amount of money to spend on a cooperative board election." --Ross Fischer, who won the District 5 race, said he spent about $4,200, or less than $1 for each of the 4,824 votes he drew "to communicate directly with PEC voters in order to overcome a coordinated effort to control" the board. He said in his email that Fraser "is right that it is cost prohibitive to reach (all) PEC voters. A candidate must be willing to spend money in order to compete with the special interests who want to raise rates in order to finance an environmental agenda. Single-member districts would make it financially feasible for an average ratepayer to run for the PEC board, and would increase meaningful communications between members and their board." Fischer and Summy both referenced a Feb. 15 letter to board members from the steering committee of PEC4U which describes the group’s formation four and a half years ago as a "loose-knit organization and website" that initially wanted whose "initial motivation was "to encourage PEC to reduce fossil fuel use and make renewable energy and conservation programs available to all PEC members. We quickly learned that no real change would come about without substantial changes in PEC's governance and board election process." The letter also expresses pride in the group’s recruitment and backing of candidates in the last three board elections. "You are all directors whom we endorsed and helped get elected," the letter says. "We feel that our close relationship with the press, as well as with Clean Water Action and Public Citizen, played a key role in those elections." At Public Citizen’s Texas office, researcher/organizer Andy Wilson told us that group does not endorse Pedernales board candidates but encourages voter turnout. Wilson said it has taken no position on whether co-op members should elect the board from single-member districts. Next, we asked PEC4U steering committee members about their expenditures. They replied that the group never has had a political kitty and has not made candidate donations or campaign-related expenditures. "We have no hidden deep pockets and have not spent money on campaigns," said committee member Sue Barnett. However, steering committee member John Watson said, the group has "engaged in emailing, phoning and personal contact" with co-op members. Member Bill Christensen said: "Though some individuals may have spent a few dollars here and there to make photocopies and such, PEC4U itself does not spend any money - it doesn't even have a bank account or any legal status. It's a very loose organization." Member Ric Sternberg said: "My out-of-pocket expenses have been about $30/year for (web) domain renewal fees since 2006 or 2007 . . . I think we may have also donated some poster board and toner and paper for our printer." Summing up: Of 10 candidates who responded to our inquiry, only one said he spent more than $4,000; others said they spent from nothing to $3,000. We circled back to Fraser, who said his original "offhand remark" reflected what it would cost a typical resident to beat a foe backed by PEC4U and Clean Water Action, which along with Public Citizen he called "the machine." Noting that only the well-prepared Fischer has bested such a candidate since the groups started influencing co-op elections, Fraser said: "I’m not sure if it’s $300,000 or $50,000 or $1.2 million... Under any scenario, if you’re going to contact 210,000 people, it’s expensive." Our final analysis of Fraser’s cost declaration: Get out. We see no reason for using any Texas House race as a guide to estimating the costs of seeking a board seat. And the responses we got from most of last year’s candidates suggests there’s no basis for pegging the costs of such campaigns anywhere near $300,000, which is more than 60 times--60!--the most that anyone told us they spent. The statement is so inaccurate, it smokes. Pants on Fire.	None	Troy Fraser	None	None	None	2011-05-02T06:00:00	2011-04-19	['None']

pomt-06957	Says $500 billion in Medicare cuts are coming.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2011/jul/17/lois-kolkhorst/lois-kolkhorst-says-obama-administration-cutting-m/	Defending her own health care measure, state Rep. Lois Kolkhorst answered a colleague’s query about preserving insurance for the elderly of Texas by warning that national cuts loom. The Brenham Republican, who chairs the House Public Health Committee, said during June 15 floor debate: "We know they are reducing the entitlement to Medicare." She added: "We know that we have these cuts coming our way of over half a trillion to Medicare." We do? Some background: PolitiFact teams in Washington and other states have pointed out that it’s incorrect to deem reductions in the growth of Medicare spending, written into the federal health care overhaul signed into law last year by President Barack Obama, as cuts. These reductions are being counted as projected savings compared to what would have happened without the change in law. The program’s overall costs are projected to increase to $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in 2009, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Also, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, tagged Obamacare by critics, doesn’t eliminate benefits. Indeed, portions of the law improve benefits and coverage, according to Tricia Neuman, director of the Medicare Policy Project at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan, nonprofit health care research organization. Medicare will cover more preventive health care services, such as wellness visits, and recipients won't face the "doughnut hole" gap in prescription coverage imposed under an existing Medicare program. Other provisions reduce the growth in Medicare spending by helping the program operate more efficiently and fund other coverage expansions to the uninsured. Other provisions are designed to improve the delivery of care and quality of care, Neuman has said. To back up Kolkhorst's claim, which was brought to our attention by Democratic activist Phillip Martin, her office passed along a September 2010 Wall Street Journal opinion piece quoting Richard S. Foster, Medicare's chief actuary, outlining intended cuts in payments to medical providers and hospitals as well as reductions in payments for Medicare Advantage, an optional program where the federal government pays private insurance companies a set rate to treat Medicare recipients. It was hoped that competition between private insurers for Medicare Advantage programs would drive down costs and make the system more efficient, ultimately saving the federal government money. But it has not worked out that way. A June 2009 analysis from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission said the Advantage programs cost taxpayers an average of 14 percent more than traditional Medicare. The 2010 health care law will phase out extra payments for Medicare Advantage programs to bring their costs in line with traditional Medicare. The law also calls for slowing increases in payment rates to hospitals and other service providers each year. Also, the law directs a new national board to identify $15.5 billion in savings, though the board — the Independent Payment Advisory Board — is prohibited from proposing anything that would ration care or reduce or modify benefits. Kolkhorst’s office pointed us to the Medicare actuary’s April 2010 analysis, which includes a chart suggesting that through 2019, the new law will net Medicare "savings" of $575.1 billion. It also says that 60.5 million Americans will be covered by Medicare in 2019, the same number that would have been covered without a change in law. Foster’s memo says the Medicare savings are to be achieved largely through reduced payments to medical providers including hospitals, tied to raised productivity expectations. It warns, though, that those gains are unlikely to be sustainable on a permanent basis and would also probably prove unworkable and less than projected in some health-care sectors during the law’s roll-out. Moreover, his memo says, health care providers "for whom Medicare constitutes a substantive portion of their business could find it difficult to remain profitable and, absent legislative intervention, might end their participation in the program (possibly jeopardizing access to care for beneficiaries)." It says its own simulations suggest that about 15 percent of providers in the Medicare program specific to inpatient care in hospitals and skilled nursing facilities as well as hospice care and home health services would become unprofitable by 2019 due to the productivity provisions. Kolkhorst’s chief of staff, Chris Steinbach, suggested the projected reductions in rates are tantamount to cuts in Medicare. He said by email: "If there is an entitlement for everyone eligible to receive a pizza, and we are cutting the rate paid to pizza kitchens by x percent, then there will be less of that entitlement for pizza." Similarly, Kolkhorst told us the changes built into the 2010 law will reduce access to Medicare. "You’re splitting hairs to say those are savings; they’re cuts," she said, adding: "Things are going to change ... To say that everything is going to remain as it is today, that’s erroneous." That last point seems reasonable, but it’s not exactly what she told her House colleagues. The referenced $500 billion figure depends on a slowing in the pace of Medicare cost increases. That’s not the same as cutting back. Medicare spending will still grow; benefits will expand. Still, there remains the prospect of some providers quitting Medicare, possibly making it harder for patients to get care. Kolkhorst’s statement has an element of truth, making it Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-03541	Says 70,000 children "have lost their Head Start slots" because of the sequester.	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2013/may/28/mark-warner/mark-warner-says-sequester-has-caused-70000-childr/	Faced with complaints about airport delays being caused by the sequester, Congress last month halted a furlough of air traffic controllers that had been part of its budget-cutting agreement. U.S. Sen Mark Warner, D-Va., recently wondered why members of Congress -- frequent fliers, themselves -- haven’t shown the same urgency to protect disadvantaged 3- and- 4-year-olds who also are being hurt by the spending cuts. "Everybody gets up in arms when people have to wait to get an airplane ride and Congress acts immediately because that’s visible," he said during a May 14 interview on WHRV-FM in Norfolk. "What’s not visible is the 70,000 kids who have lost their Head Start slots..." For several years, Warner has been seeking a bipartisan solution to the nation’s budget stalemate that includes spending cuts and tax increases. He has called the sequester, which began triggering automatic cuts to defense and domestic programs on March 1, "the most stupid option on the table." During his recent radio interview, he also lamented sequester-caused reductions in federal grants for college students and research at the National Institute of Health. We were struck by his claim that 70,000 children have lost access to Head Start, an educational program that prepares disadvantaged kids to start elementary school, and decided to see whether Warner is right. More than a million children -- from families that live below the poverty line or receive public assistance -- are enrolled in Head Start half-day or full-day programs. The federal government offers competitive contracts to public and private providers, so many groups may offer Head Start programs in a locality. As PolitiFact Florida recently noted examining a similar claim, Head Start enrollment hit record highs in recent years because the Obama administration nearly doubled the number of children eligible for Early Head Start, which serves eligible children up to the age of eligibility for Head Start. Congress then decided to spend more money on Head Start to maintain enrollment for those children. A month before the sequester began, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius sent a Feb. 1 letter to the Senate Appropriations Committee detailing cuts to programs under her purview. Among them, she wrote, "up to 70,000 children would lose access to Head Start and Early Head Start services." Warner’s statement went a step further, saying 70,000 children "have lost their Head Start slots." When we asked his office for an explanation, spokesman Kevin Hall emailed us two news releases and two news articles about the sequester that were written after Sebelius’ letter. He included a Feb. 8 White House fact sheet on the harm of the sequester. At the top of the list, it said "70,000 young children would be kicked off Head Start …" Hall also sent news articles written by NPRand Education Week and web postings from the National Head Start Association -- a group of the agencies that run local programs -- that, in varying ways, say a reduction of 70,000 Head Start slots may or will happen. Annual funding for Head Start is being cut by 5.27 percent. HHS spokesman Ted Froats said Sebelius’ estimate of losing up to 70,000 spots hasn’t changed. But he also said HHS does not know how many children have been dropped since the sequester began and that the agency is gathering that data and hopes to release a report in June. Each local program across the nation has the flexibility to determine how it will adjust to its budget cuts and news reports say many are exploring solutions that don’t involve reducing enrollment, such as switching from a full-year to a nine-month program, closing one day a month, or fundraising. For Virginia, the White House estimated that up to 1,000 children would lose Head Start or Early Head Start services before the end of the year. But state officials don’t yet know what the results will be. Maxine McKinney, executive director of the Virginia Head Start Association, wrote in an email that she thinks most state programs so far have been able to maintain programs because the sequester did not begin until well into their budget year, which runs from the start from July to the end of June. But she hasn’t received figures yet on how the local programs will cope with the coming budget year. "Many programs are reducing enrollment," she said. "Others are able to absorb the cuts by eliminating non-mandated services, reducing staff, etc." Of the 21 programs she’s heard from so far, 10 are reducing their slots by 263. But the 21 programs accounts for fewer than half in the state. Our ruling Warner said 70,000 children have "lost their Head Start slots" because of the sequester. He strains the limit of an Obama administration estimate that "up to" that number of children may lose out. There’s no doubt that many children will lose Head Start spots as the budget cuts sink in, but at this point, nobody knows how many already have. HHS is gathering that information. The White House estimate assumes that local Head Start organizations will respond to funding cuts by reducing slots, but that isn’t the only option. Many organizations are exploring different options, such as fundraising and reducing hours. Warner’s statement contains an element of truth in that some children already have lost Head Starts slots and others have less access to the program. But by and large, he assumes that a worst-case scenario for Head Start has already taken place. We rate his statement Mostly False.

pomt-02175	David Perdue supports Common Core	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2014/apr/29/david-perdue-files/common-core-claim-doesnt-make-grade/	Republican U.S. Senate candidate David Perdue is now on a list that shows he’s truly arrived in politics -- he’s the subject of a website attack. It’s called "The David Perdue Files," and it accuses the political newcomer of being a RINO -- Republican in Name Only -- with "liberal positions and establishment ties." The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s Political Insider column brought the website to our attention with a post about it. The website included several "facts" about Perdue. One caught our attention, since it’s an issue that many conservatives have been as strident in their opposition to as the federal health care law, aka Obamacare. "David Perdue supports Common Core," it says. True? The website cites a Marietta Daily Journal interview with Perdue done in February. The article, though, offers some context that’s not offered on the web post about the candidate. The people who put the website together haven’t identified themselves (the website’s author is Truth Be Told), so we couldn’t talk to them about it. Perdue is part of a crowded field of Republicans running this year for an open seat in the U.S. Senate. The current senator, Saxby Chambliss, a Republican, is retiring. Perdue, a former CEO of several larger companies and a cousin of former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue, has risen to the top of some polls and, thus, become a target of his opponents and others leery of some of his positions. The Republican Party primary is set for May 20. The campaign for the GOP nomination has largely been a contest among the candidates to prove who is the most conservative. On one issue, Common Core, the candidates have largely spoken against it. The anti-Perdue website, though, says he supports it. If true, it could mean trouble for Perdue. Common Core is a set of educational guidelines aimed at creating uniformed standards for student proficiency in several subjects. They were created by governors and education officials and adopted in nearly every state. Sonny Perdue helped spearhead the effort and has said it was a way to prevent the federal government from interfering in state education policies. The Common Core standards were released in June 2010 with the support of the National Governors Association and other groups. "We felt like we needed to take steps as governors to actually prevent a federal mandate that came in this area. We saw No Child Left Behind as somewhat of an intrusion in state business," the former governor said in a 2013 Washington Post interview. "We didn’t want another federal mandate that came in and said: ‘Here’s what your state looks like compared to Switzerland’ or wherever." The Common Core plan was adopted by Georgia GOP leaders in 2010. This past June, however, the state Republican Party voted unanimously to urge state leaders to withdraw from the program because it "obliterates Georgia's constitutional autonomy." Tea party leaders and others say Common Core was adopted with little debate, and they worried it would be a federal takeover of education. The Obama administration has awarded extra points in its Race to the Top funding program for states that have worked to create common college- and career-ready standards. The Republican-led state House of Representatives passed legislation this year to create a study committee on Common Core and the federal government’s "increasingly greater role in public education." David Perdue, whose wife and parents were teachers, said he has talked to his cousin about the issue. "The original intent, I agree with that. It’s where it gets into the details, into the weeds of how it’s going to be administered, that’s where I have a problem with that," Perdue said in the Marietta Daily Journal. The candidate said Georgia should determine how it sets its standards, and the newspaper reported that Perdue said he agrees with Gov. Nathan Deal’s position opposing the testing component of Common Core. Perdue made similar comments in an interview posted on YouTube. The candidate said he didn’t have a problem with Common Core’s original intent. "When they start trying to legislate and dictate curriculum and that sort of thing, and that includes how you measure up in the test, I have a major problem with that," he said. "I’d really like to get the Department of Education out of this and get that money back to the states and put the power back into teachers and parents, which is where it belongs." Some conservatives question Perdue’s explanation. Erick Erickson, a prominent conservative commentator and radio show host who has endorsed former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel in the Senate race, asked Perdue about his comments in the Marietta Daily Journal. Perdue said Common Core had gotten "convoluted" when the federal government got involved. His campaign said Perdue supports what was put together by the National Governors Association. "I want to clear the air. I think Common Core is overreaching right now and should be abandoned in its current form," Perdue said in a radio interview with Erickson on News 95.5 and AM 750 WSB. News 95.5 and AM 750 WSB is owned by Cox Enterprises, which also owns The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Perdue spokesman Derrick Dickey told PolitiFact Georgia that the candidate believes "Common Core has become overreaching and should be abandoned." Dickey called The David Perdue Files "a crass, politically motivated effort to misrepresent many of David’s positions." Judging from The David Perdue Files website, Perdue has not convinced some conservatives about his position on Common Core. To sum up, a website claimed Perdue "supports Common Core." Perdue has said in several interviews that he believes in the initial intent of Common Core as a means of states setting their own educational goals by what was proposed by the National Governors Association. Perdue, though, has said he is concerned about federal involvement in the effort. The website is correct on some level. Perdue did initially support the concept of Common Core, like many other Republicans. But he has made it very clear he has soured on the details and now opposes it. There is a kernel of truth here, but just a kernel. We rate the website attack on Perdue as Mostly False.	None	The David Perdue Files	None	None	None	2014-04-29T06:00:00	2014-04-21	['None']
pomt-06907	The 2011-13 state budget "cuts overall funding for public schools by $1.6 billion"	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jul/25/jennifer-shilling/wisconsin-jennifer-shilling-state-budget-cut-publi/	As the historic Wisconsin Senate recall elections drive toward their end, Democrats are working overtime to highlight what they consider lowlights in the Republican-drafted state budget. Cuts to public school funding are near the top of their list, with a chorus of critics repeating an eye-popping figure: $1.6 billion. One recall candidate, state Rep. Jennifer Shilling (D-La Crosse), complains on her legislative website that the Republican budget "cuts overall funding for public schools by $1.6 billion statewide..." Shilling is trying to unseat state Sen. Dan Kapanke (R-La Crosse). Did the two-year budget really take that big a bite out of schools? Shilling and Democrats point to statements by state schools Superintendent Tony Evers and a report by the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. Evers is an elected official who runs the state Department of Public Instruction. Both present the $1.6 billion figure -- but do it in tandem with a second, much lower figure of $800 million to $900 million. Here is an important note: Shilling’s claim of $1.6 billion relates to the new revenue limits the budget put on local school districts. (Shilling is also critical of the cut of $792 million in direct state aid to schools. That’s been the subject of TV ads against the GOP senators, the cut of "nearly $800 million." But that cut is separate from the $1.6 billion claim we are looking at here. Shilling’s office acknowledges that point.) This may all sound arcane, but ultimately the revenue limits determine how much your schools can take in from local property taxes and state school aids -- and how much money gets into the classroom. Let’s look back in time to figure this out. As they worked to close a big budget shortfall projected for 2011-’13, Gov. Scott Walker and the Republican-controlled Legislature cut direct state aid to schools (the $792 million). Then they greatly restricted schools’ ability to raise property taxes to make up for the lost aid. The goal was to be sure a savings at the state level was not eaten up by higher local taxes. It was not the first time the state squeezed school aid. In 2009, Gov. Jim Doyle and Democrats who controlled the Capitol enacted an aid trim in the 2009-’11 budget. They also slowed the growth in how much schools could raise in property taxes. But the Dems left a little gift for schools. They wrote into state law a provision on the property tax limits. They directed the next Legislature to re-set the revenue limits in the 2011-’13 budget to what they were before they were tightened. Think of it as your boss promising you a catch-up raise in writing two years from now … even if it’s not certain your boss will be around then. Indeed, Doyle did not run again, many of the Democrats are gone and the the party lost both chambers in the November 2010 election. And the new bosses, Walker and legislative Republicans, turned to school cuts to help balance the budget. They also agreed that they couldn’t accept the Democrat-set limits, and they put in place a real cut in both state school aid and allowable property tax growth. Now, back to the future. Today, Democrats such as Shilling are saying the budget "cuts overall funding for public schools by $1.6 billion." That is, schools can take in $1.6 billion less over two years as a result of the revenue limits. They get that by comparing the stricter limits enacted by the GOP to the increase Doyle and the Democrats had built into the budget for 2011-’13. But that can be a skewed way to measure a cut. Actual school spending from one year to the next will not go down $1.6 billion. The year-to-year comparison gets you to the smaller number -- an $800 million to $900 million-plus loss of potential resources for schools. Two education financing sources we turned to -- Russ Kava of the Legislative Fiscal Bureau and officials at the state Department of Public Instruction -- said their agencies choose to present both perspectives. They said they did this because of past practice and the value of showing both the actual impact as well as the larger swing from the Democrat-desired limits to the new budget. A May 31, 2011 statement from Evers put it this way: "Last week the Joint Finance Committee, on a 12-4 vote, cut public schools by $1.6 billion compared to current law and over $850 million compared to current levels by making the first significant reduction to revenue caps ever." In making her case, Shilling, as well as fellow Democratic recall candidate Shelly Moore in River Falls, cherry-picks the higher number. There are a couple of problems with that. One is that when you look at what the state budget actually saved on K-12 education compared with the last budget, experts say it’s close to the $800 million to $900 million. Second, even the lower figure (the $800 million to $900 million) is only an estimate, and one that assumes that school districts would have "taxed to the max" without the limits. That’s unlikely, based on recent history, according to Andrew Reschovsky, a University of Wisconsin-Madison economist who publishes reports on school funding. That means even the $800 million to $900 million figure could be high, and underscores the importance of presenting multiple perspectives. Reschovsky prefers to study the actual year-to-year change, which yields the smaller number. He says the average person just looks at the bottom line difference, not what might have been. Remember that promised pay raise from your boss? If your salary was cut instead, your household budget would be reduced only in the actual difference -- not the theoretical difference, with the promised raise included. Democrats argue that schools planned on the restoration of the 2009 cut because it was in statute. But others say the handwriting was on the wall long ago. Reschovsky, who describes himself as an ardent support of public education, said it’s hard to argue that any governor could have avoided some cuts to education given the size of the budget gap. Finally, there is the issue of the spending side of school budgets. Along with the reduction in state aid and tougher tax limits, Walker and the GOP provided local school districts with a savings opportunity. Their limits on collective bargaining by public employees allow the school districts to require employees to pay more for health insurance and pensions. The "tools," as Walkers calls them, have allowed some -- but not all -- districts to offset the reduction in spending on education, at least for next year, the Journal Sentinel reported. So from some school districts’ perspective, the state budget giveth as well as taketh away -- and Shilling cited only the taketh away part. Let’s put away the calculator. Like some other Democrats, Shilling claims the 2011-’13 state budget cut $1.6 billion from local schools. The number comes from respected sources, but she uses it out of context, leaving out the much lower companion figure of around $800 million to $900 million that experts typically present along with the $1.6 billion as a measure of the true year-to-year loss. The statement contains an element of truth, but ignores the reality behind the lower figure. That fits the definition for Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-02848	In "reality," there have "been no problems whatsoever" with the Texas voter ID law.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/nov/19/greg-abbott/texas-problems-voter-id-law-popped-during-earl/	On the eve of the 2013 general election, a Republican candidate for governor of Texas in 2014 suggested the state’s mandate requiring voters to present photo identification at the polls was proving no big squeeze. Critics including Democrats had said the requirement, implemented for the first time in the November elections, would deter voters lacking an accepted ID, especially the elderly, minorities and the indigent. But a Nov. 4, 2013, Associated Press news story quoted Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, who has defended the 2011 law in court, as saying critics failed to make their case. "I haven't ever seen anything that was overhyped as much as some partisan efforts to overhype concerns about this," Abbott said, "when, in reality, there has been no problems whatsoever." Not a one? Speaker Wright's ID Hector Nieto, a spokesman for the pro-Democratic Lone Star Project, disputed Abbott’s statement after bringing it to our attention. By email, Nieto noted news reports indicating the ID hurdle affected Sandra Watts, a Nueces County state district judge, and Jim Wright, the former U.S. House speaker. According to an Oct. 22, 2013, news account by KIII-TV, Channel 3 in Corpus Christi, Watts said she had to check a box swearing she was who she said she was when her name on her ID did not match her name on voting records. (Abbott and Wendy Davis, the Democratic state senator running for governor, similarly reported having to do the same, according to subsequent news reports.) Wright, 90, saying his driver’s license had expired, said he had to dig up a copy of his birth certificate before the Department of Public Safety would grant him a free personal identification card enabling him to vote on Election Day, Nov. 5, according to a Nov. 4, 2013, Fort Worth Star-Telegram news story. Under the law, whose implementation was delayed by legal challenges, voters going to the polls are expected to present a photo ID issued by the DPS (a driver's license, personal ID card, concealed handgun license or election identification certificate) or the federal government (a passport, military ID or a citizenship or naturalization certificate). News accounts generally upbeat Mindful that Abbott piped up before Election Day, we considered solely news stories completed by that time. This means that, like Abbott, we were limited to considering how the ID mandate affected voters in the state’s "early voting" period, which ran from Oct. 21 through Nov. 1. By email, Abbott spokesman Jerry Strickland pointed out news stories indicating no problems with the ID law. Among them, a Nov. 4, 2013, Waco Tribune-Herald story quoted Kathy Van Wolfe, the McClennan County elections administrator, as saying: "I haven’t had any of my polling places call me because there was a problem." Similarly, other newspapers mostly reported smooth sailing, though officials also cautioned against sweeping conclusions by suggesting the 2013 ballot was unlikely to drive high turnout, meaning casual voters (including those less likely to carry appropriate IDs) were not expected at the polls. Statewide, voters were mostly considering proposed constitutional amendments and local propositions, though Houston had a mayoral election. In a Nov. 2, 2013, news story, the Houston Chronicle said that according to officials in Harris County and elsewhere, the ID mandate had not prevented anyone from voting. The Chronicle noted "minor instances of confusion" around the state and quoted the Harris County clerk, Stan Stanart, as saying the ID law caused no real problems; seven voters had to cast provisional ballots, which wouldn't be counted unless the voters proved their identities and were registerd to vote in the county. "Two of the seven showed up without a photo ID, two had out-of-state IDs, and the other four had IDs that were long expired," Stanart told the paper. "In the big picture, that's not much when you consider more than 80,000 people voted" locally. Steve Raborn, elections administrator for Tarrant County, told the Star-Telegram for an Oct. 28, 2013, news story: "We’ve really had no complaints, concerns or issues. But it’s only a small test given the low turnout," Raborn said. "Voters who turn out for these constitutional amendment and bond elections are frequent voters. They know the drill." The 2014 ballot will feature races for a range of offices topped by the U.S. Senate. An Oct. 27, 2013, news story in the Dallas Morning News reported "hiccups" at the polls, otherwise quoting Toni Pippins-Poole, the Dallas County elections administrator, as saying that many voters had to sign affidavits, swearing they were who they said they were, but no voter had been deterred from casting a ballot. On Oct. 29, 2013, the Dallas newspaper said on its Trailblazers blog that at least one in seven of more than 6,800 early voters had cast ballots after signing affidavits. The blog post said: "Election officials are taking pains to minimize the hassle. At polling locations in Dallas County, voters also have the option of updating their information in the voter registration database so it matches their photo identification going forward. But at the least, there’s an extra minute or two of inconvenience for some voters." In an Oct. 31, 2013, news story, the San Antonio Express-News quoted the Bexar County elections administrator, Jacque Callanen, as saying that local voting had been mostly uneventful. The story also said: "That's not to say there haven't been some disgruntled voters -- three, to be exact. Callanen said they had voter registration certificates but no photo IDs and grew irate when asked to take additional steps to vote." A couple days earlier, an Express-News news story quoted a Rice University political scientist, Mark Jones, as saying that the requests that voters affirm their identities wasn’t overly complicated. Jones said: "If no one is denied the right to vote, and the sole impact is they have to check a box ... that's unlikely to resonate outside of the (Democratic Party) faithful. For me, the voter ID law's principal impact is the impact you can't see: the person who does not turn out because they lack documentation." An Austin American-Statesman news story posted online Oct. 28, 2013, quoted election officials in Travis, Hays and Williamson counties as saying the ID law wasn’t keeping women from voting. The story quoted Jason Barnett, Williamson County’s elections administrator, as saying he taught election workers to look at the "totality of circumstances" to determine voters' identities when names weren’t identical on IDs and voter registration cards. "It's not a complicated process," Barnett said. Joyce Cowan, the Hays County elections administrator, said the law hadn't brought troubles. "We have not had major problems," Cowan said. An Oct. 26, 2013, El Paso Times news story reported no local problems with the ID law, also quoting an early voter, Jose Rodriguez, as saying the law didn't inconvenience him. Challenges for the elderly Informed of the tenor of these news stories, Nieto emailed us links to an Oct. 22, 2013, news report by KLTV-TV, Channel 7 in Tyler, stating that Elizabeth Pottinger, 96, would have to vote by mail--which does not require an ID to be presented--because she lacked the documents needed to obtain an ID that would be accepted at the polls. Nieto also pointed out a Sept. 21, 2013, news story by KTRK-TV, Channel 13 in Houston, stating that Dorothy Card, 84, of Lufkin, had failed to present the documents needed to get a DPS ID card. State law permitted her to vote by mail, the story said, but Card said voting at the courthouse had been her Election Day routine for years. Ultimately, the story said a DPS spokesperson, not identified, had assured the station that Card would be issued an ID card without more difficulties. Turnout and provisional ballots on rise Next, we wondered if there was an effect on turnout or the prevalence of provisional ballots--the kind that an adult can submit with the understanding that it won’t be counted unless they soon resolve the issue that prevented them casting a regular ballot. Turnout in the early-voting period was up from 2011, the last time the state had a comparable low-key general election. In 2013, nearly 284,000 Texans voted early in person, as opposed to by mail, according to the Texas Secretary of State’s office, accounting for 3.3 percent of the state’s more than 8.5 million registered voters. In contrast, the office says, 156,317 voters, or 2 percent of 8 million registered voters, voted early in 2011. The number of provisional ballots cast also was up compared to 2011, according to information emailed to us by Jeff Hillery, a spokesman for the Texas Secretary of State’s office. According to the state, 131 provisional ballots were cast in the 2011 early-voting period. In the 2013 early-voting period, 398 provisional ballots--or 200 percent more than in 2011--were submitted. As in 2011, most counties fielded no provisional ballots, according to this information, while Medina County had the state’s most provisional ballots: 92. But that county didn’t have voter ID troubles, according to its elections administrator, Patricia Barton. Only two of the provisional ballots cast during early voting came from individuals lacking proper IDs, Barton told us by phone, and both were "cured"--meaning the voters returned with proofs of identity that meant their ballots would be counted. Barton said the remaining provisional ballots came from individuals who were not registered to vote or not registered in the county. In Austin and Travis County, four of 31 provisional ballots collected during early voting involved individuals lacking an accepted ID, Dana DeBouviers, the county clerk, said by telephone. State official: Provisional ballots not problems Hillery suggested by email that provisional ballots aren’t "problems" at the polls. "A problem would be if the correct process wasn’t followed during the election," Hillery said, adding that the agency "had very few reports of any confusion or issues on what the acceptable forms of ID were." Hillery stressed, too, that provisional ballots were an option mandated by the federal Help American Vote Act of 2002. "All voters who show up at the polls are offered at least the opportunity to vote provisionally," Hillery said, which "means that no voter is turned away from the polls because of the need for an acceptable form of photo ID. Here in Texas, if a voter shows up at the polls with an expired driver’s license or without any of the seven acceptable forms of ID, they will at least get a provisional ballot—meaning that they can still exercise their right to vote under the available circumstances. The voter then has a reasonable amount of time (six days; seven in this last election) to cure their vote and have it counted after going to the county registrar’s office and showing an acceptable form of photo ID to prove who they are. It’s also important to note that not every provisional ballot is necessarily the result of the photo ID requirement." Our ruling Abbott said there were "no problems whatsoever" with the voter ID law leading up to the 2013 Texas elections. As Speaker Wright and some fellow Texans could attest, none is not correct. News stories reveal various if rare experiences that could be construed as problems, such as voters having to scramble to get the proper ID. There also was a surge in provisional (largely uncounted) ballots, though we did not determine whether the ID law was key to that. This claim has an element of truth but overlooks the overriding reality that there were some problems. Mark the statement Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-03033	I am "the only candidate for lieutenant governor to oppose in-state tuition for illegal immigrants."	false	/texas/statements/2013/oct/09/dan-patrick/dan-patrick-isnt-alone-among-candidates-oppose-sta/	Dan Patrick wasn’t an elected official when lawmakers and Gov. Rick Perry agreed to authorize in-state college tuition for certain children of illegal immigrants living in Texas. Now, the Houston state senator says in a campaign ad that he is "the only candidate for lieutenant governor to oppose in-state tuition for illegal immigrants." Patrick is among Texans jockeying for the GOP nomination to fill the post overseeing the Senate. The others are third-term incumbent David Dewhurst, state Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson and state Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples. In 2001, when the law came to be, neither Patrick, Dewhurst or Patterson had direct says on it. Dewhurst was then the state land commissioner and Patterson was a former state senator. Staples was an East Texas senator and among the vast majority of legislators who voted for House Bill 1403, which became the law that lets undocumented students who have graduated from a Texas high school and lived in Texas for at least three years qualify for in-state tuition — if they sign an affidavit saying they intend to apply for permanent residency as soon as they're able to do so. Through August 2011, 38,656 non-U.S. citizens and permanent residents had attended Texas colleges or universities at in-state tuition rates, according to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. And as we noted in a 2011 article, only five of 181 Texas House and Senate members voted against the legislation. The Texas House passed the measure 142-1 before the Senate approved an amended version by 27-3, with Republicans Mike Jackson of La Porte, Jane Nelson of Flower Mound and Jeff Wentworth of San Antonio in opposition. Staples was among a dozen Republicans voting "aye," according to the Senate Journal entry for that day. The House went along with the Senate version with Rep. Jerry Madden, R-Richardson, pushing the legislation’s total tally of "no" votes to five. In 2011, Sen. Brian Birdwell, R-Granbury, filed a proposal to repeal the tuition law, but it never made it past the four Republicans and three Democrats who comprised the Senate Higher Education Committee, the Austin American-Statesman said in a Sept. 28, 2011, news article. Birdwell then offered an amendment on the Senate floor that was intended to keep illegal immigrants from qualifying to pay in-state tuition. A document posted online by Patrick’s campaign on behalf of his ad notes that Patrick was among four Republican co-authors of that amendment. According to the Senate Journal showing that May 9, 2011, action, Birdwell withdrew the amendment without the Senate voting on it. According to the Senate’s video of Birdwell’s presentation of his floor amendment, Patrick did not speak during the 30-minute floor discussion; seven other senators asked questions or made statements. Legislative records also indicate that Patrick filed his own repeal proposal in the 2009 regular session; it did not get a hearing. So, is Patrick the only one among the four candidates "to oppose" in-state tuition for illegal immigrants? He’s not the only one who opposes it. Staples has said he favors repealing the law. Dewhurst has said that if had been governor in 2001, he would not have signed it into law. And Patterson has said he opposes the benefit, stressing that the issue of legal residency status should be dealt with first. By email, Staples’ campaign spokesman Kent Sholars provided a statement from Staples saying: "I oppose giving benefits to those who have violated our nation’s entry laws. If that bill came up for a vote today, it would not pass, and I support its repeal." Sholars also provided a video excerpt of Staples referring to the 2001 legislation during an Oct. 3, 2013, candidate forum in Houston. Staples, who left the Senate in early 2007, said that the measure "that created in-state tuition was predicated on the assumption that those students would correct their status. That has not been enforced. And it should be repealed." Good reminder. In 2010, we reported that neither the Texas Education Agency, the coordinating board or the University of Texas at Austin was checking on whether students had applied for permanent residency as they were promising to do in the required affidavits. Institutional officials told us that no law required such follow-ups. By email, board staff spokesman Dominic Chavez recently told us that state law remains silent on designating an agency to check on students seeking legal residency, but the board now has rules requiring affected colleges and universities to retain student affidavits indefinitely or until a student documents compliance. Also, Chavez said, the board has instituted a policy requiring institutions to annually counsel students about their responsibilities in accord with the affidavits. The document from Patrick’s campaign points out that Dewhurst made his opposition to the law clear in 2011--which was at a time Perry was getting pummeled in GOP presidential debates for standing behind the law. Dewhurst said in a September 2011 interview with WFAA-TV, Channel 8 in Dallas: "If we're not going to give fellow Americans who live in Louisiana or Oklahoma or New Mexico the ability to come into Texas and have in-state tuition and save, then is it fair to give that break to people who are not citizens here? So, I would not have signed that law." Dewhurst did not say in that interview whether the law should be repealed, according to a Sept. 26, 2011, Dallas Morning News news article. By email, Dewhurst campaign spokesman Travis Considine told us Dewhurst has always opposed in-state tuition for illegal immigrants. News stories we found using the Nexis service show no signs that Dewhurst tried to repeal it. A Sept. 27, 2011, Associated Press news story said that at the time, Dewhurst's political rivals, including Ted Cruz, who was then scrambling to overtake the better-known Dewhurst for the 2012 Republican U.S. Senate nomination, "blamed him for not doing more to repeal the law as leader of the Texas Senate." The AP story quoted Matt Hirsch, spokesman for Dewhurst’s Senate campaign, as defending Dewhurst’s legislative record. "The overwhelming majority of the Senate favored the in-state tuition benefit," Hirsch said, and Perry "has been firm in his support of the law. In light of Gov. Perry's veto pen, it was clear that any attempt to repeal this benefit would not be signed into law." Earlier, a May 10, 2007, Fort Worth Star-Telegram news story quoted Dewhurst as saying that if a House proposal to repeal the 2001 law had reached the Senate, its chances of passage would have been slim. "We'd take a look at it, but historically the Senate has been in favor of providing in-state tuition for everyone living here," Dewhurst said then. The September 2011 American-Statesman news article recapping Dewhurst’s statement that he would not have signed the 2001 legislation into law also noted that Dewhurst and state lawmakers had shown little appetite for repealing it. The story said "there is little evidence to suggest" that Dewhurst had tried to repeal the law since becoming lieutenant governor in 2003. "In fact," the story said, "a 2005 piece of legislation clarifying the policy passed the Senate with a 29-0 vote. (The lieutenant governor does not vote.)" In a June 20, 2012, news story, the Texas Tribune said: "Dewhurst has said he opposes it but never pushed for the Legislature to repeal it because the votes weren't there." Regarding Patterson, Patrick’s camp asserted that in a February 2013 interview with the El Paso Times, Patterson said both that he did not support in-state tuition "for illegals" and that he supports the idea of "fixing" the legal residency status of undocumented immigrants attending Texas colleges and universities. In a telephone interview, Patterson said he was trying to stress the importance of federal immigration reform. After the Times asked Patterson his position on the tuition law, he replied: "I don't support the idea of saying, ‘We're going to ignore the law and let you do that.’ I support the idea of fixing their status as opposed to trying to just sweep the status under the rug. I would not support an in-state tuition bill for illegals. I would support a method of providing them a lawful status where in-state tuition for illegals wouldn't be a problem. We're Band-Aiding." Patterson told us federal immigration reform would presumably resolve the legal status of many residents. He also said the Texas law should be repealed. On Patterson’s campaign website, Patterson listed 10 positions he has on immigration, followed by No. 11: "Unlike others in this race, I didn’t vote for and I would have never voted for or supported in-state tuition for illegal aliens." Patterson’s campaign manager, Chris Elam, told us by telephone that No. 11 was added after the candidates sparred Oct. 3 in Houston. We told Patrick’s campaign manager, Logan Spence, that Patrick doesn’t appear to be alone among the candidates in opposing the law. Whoa, Spence basically replied, stressing in an email that Staples voted for the measure making the law, Dewhurst failed to let repeal measures clear the Senate and Patterson’s reply to the Times suggests he wants a "sanctuary" state. In contrast, Spence said, Patrick proposed a repeal measure and co-authored the Birdwell amendment. "You don't see a distinction?" Spence wrote. Our ruling Patrick said he’s "the only candidate for lieutenant governor to oppose in-state tuition for illegal immigrants." He is the one candidate who has filed specific proposals to repeal the law. But each of the Republican candidates was public about opposing the law before Patrick debuted his ad while it leaves the impression that other candidates favor the law or have taken no position on it. That’s just not so. We rate Patrick’s statement as False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-02576	"We have been confronted with an unexpected storm that has hit the metropolitan area."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2014/jan/30/nathan-deal/deal-defends-comments-bad-weather-was-unexpected/	Motorists stuck for hours and hours on ice-covered roads. Cars abandoned on I-285. Children forced to spend the night in schools. Across metro Atlanta, nearly everyone was saying they had never seen anything like this. At a late-night news conference just hours after the Tuesday chaos began, Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal offered his initial assessment. "As you know, we have been confronted with an unexpected storm that has hit the metropolitan area," Deal said. The president of the American Meteorological Society quickly disputed the governor’s statement. "Some in the public, social media or decision-making positions would ‘blame’ the meteorologists. I began to hear things like ‘this was not expected in Atlanta’ or ‘they said this was going to all be South of Atlanta’ or there were no Watches or Warnings until snow started falling or ‘weather is just unpredictable.’ Wrong, Wrong, Wrong, and Wrong!" Marshall Shepherd, the AMA’s president, who also teaches at the University of Georgia, wrote on his blog. Was this storm "unexpected," as Deal said? PolitiFact Georgia trudged in, searching for some answers. Deal and other Georgia leaders, such as Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, have faced withering criticism about their response. Even Al Roker, the gregarious "Today" meteorologist based in New York City, took them to task. "The mayor and the governor got on television yesterday and said, ‘Oh, this wasn’t expected,’ and that’s not true," Roker said. "We were talking about this Monday." The first question posed to Deal during a testy news conference Wednesday was whether the severe weather was "expected." The governor clarified his remarks. Deal said he thought the Atlanta region would not get the worst of the weather conditions, based on some forecasts. Areas south of Atlanta would be in more trouble, Deal said. The governor said the weather reports on the fast-moving storm conflicted. In the face of a flurry of reporter questions, Deal said that some initial forecasts had Atlanta facing only "a dusting." "I think (local forecasters) were more correct than the national weather folks were," he said. Some local television meteorologists began warning viewers a snowstorm was headed to Georgia a week beforehand. But it first appeared that the brunt of the storm would strike communities south of metro Atlanta. On Sunday afternoon, the National Weather Service issued a winter storm watch for central Georgia and south metro Atlanta. Before dawn Monday, the watch was expanded to the entire Atlanta region. The National Weather Service said Monday that central Georgia was most likely to see the most snowfall, especially overnight Tuesday, with up to three inches of the white stuff. The big concern in South Georgia, they said, was ice. "The snowfall amounts are going to matter very little in this situation because of the ice potential," said Jason Deese, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Peachtree City, according to The Associated Press. "Some parts of the state may end up seeing the greatest impact just because they get more ice than snow." Deese cautioned that the storm’s path was not entirely predictable. "We have increasing confidence a winter storm is going to affect portions of Georgia," Deese said. "It's just a matter of which portions of Georgia." The Weather Channel, based in Cobb County, predicted Monday that the brunt of the snow would hit metro Atlanta. "We could see anywhere from one to three inches here in the metro area," a forecaster said. The Georgia Emergency Management Association posted on its Facebook page Tuesday that the heaviest snowfall amounts would be between Macon and metro Atlanta. Southeast areas could expect icing from freezing rain and possible power outages. At 3:38 a.m. Tuesday, the National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning for metro Atlanta, starting at 9 a.m. It was at 9 a.m. that the city started pre-treating its roads, Reed told reporters Wednesday. The mayor said the problem was more complicated than just a weather event. Reed said everyone tried to leave at once just as the storm hit. Major roads, he said, were immediately clogged. Many school districts dismissed classes early, prompting parents to get in their cars to pick up their children. Employers across metro Atlanta told workers to go home early. The situation created a traffic nightmare in the region Tuesday afternoon in an area already jaded by gridlocked commutes. At 12:15 p.m. Tuesday, Deal said area roads were moving smoothly. Twenty minutes later, the governor said the roads were snarled. By evening, temperatures dropped and the roads iced, making it almost impossible to travel. "The error was letting everyone out at once," Reed repeatedly said. Some talk-show callers widely criticized Fulton County school officials for not letting children out earlier Tuesday. Fulton Superintendent Robert Avossa said Wednesday that the meteorologists and emergency management agencies were originally projecting that the winter storm would hit Tuesday afternoon after school was out. "As a result, we canceled after-school activities so students and staff would not be delayed in getting home," he said. "Throughout the day Tuesday, it became increasingly apparent that the weather model had changed and that the storm was arriving faster and more severe than expected. The target area also was changing to cover more of Fulton County, especially in the north, whereas the original projections were that it was going to hit south and below Fulton County." He wasn’t sure the outcome would have been different. "Several surrounding school systems did (release students earlier) but still experienced similar problems," Avossa said. So was the governor correct? Or was his statement part of a blizzard of misinformation. Deal said the Atlanta region was hit with an "unexpected" snowstorm. Deal is correct that some forecasters predicted metro Atlanta would not get the brunt of the storm. The closer the storm came to the region, the more apparent it was that metro Atlanta would see rough weather. Deal’s statement contains an element of truth -- there were conflicting weather reports as the fast-moving storm approached. But there is a lot of context necessary here. The National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning for metro Atlanta before dawn Tuesday. Ultimately, it is the job of elected leaders to make the correct calls based on the best information available. The governor and other elected officials had that information from some sources hours before the storm struck. We rate Deal’s statement as Mostly False.

pomt-14467	"I don't know anything about David Duke."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/02/donald-trump/trumps-absurd-claim-he-knows-nothing-about-former-/	A few days before Donald Trump dominated Super Tuesday, the Republican frontrunner was being rebuked left and right for declining to denounce former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. The controversy began Feb. 24, when Duke said that he supports Trump’s candidacy and told listeners of his radio program to "get active" for Trump. Two days later, Trump disavowed Duke in a news conference. But Trump, who claims to have the "world’s greatest memory," seemed to have forgotten this by Feb. 28. When CNN’s Jake Tapper asked him about Duke, Trump claimed ignorance four times: "Well, just so you understand, I don't know anything about David Duke. okay? I don't know anything about what you're even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. So, I don't know. "I don't know, did he endorse me or what's going on, because, you know, I know nothing about David Duke. I know nothing about white supremacists. And so you're asking me a question that I'm supposed to be talking about people that I know nothing about. … "I don't know any -- honestly, I don't know David Duke. I don't believe I have ever met him. I'm pretty sure I didn't meet him. And I just don't know anything about him." Later that day, Trump tweeted a video of his earlier disavowal of Duke, and blamed his failure to do it again on CNN on "a very bad earpiece." As fellow fact-checkers at the Washington Post and Factcheck.org have pointed out, Trump knew enough about Duke to denounce him several times over the past two decades. Duke mentions this election Trump, as we previously noted and as he acknowledged himself, renounced Duke just two days before he told Tapper he knew nothing about the white nationalist. When a reporter asked about Duke’s support on Feb. 26 (without identifying Duke as a former Klansman), Trump said, "I didn’t even know he endorsed me. David Duke endorsed me? Okay, all right, I disavow, okay?" And a few months ago, in August 2015, Trump "repudiated" an earlier expression of support from Duke in a Bloomberg interview: John Heilemann: "We’ve heard this week that David Duke — former Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan — has come out and said he’s in support of your candidacy. So my first question is why do people like that like Donald Trump? And second, how do you feel about the David Duke quasi-endorsement?" Trump: "I don’t know the answer to the first. Who knows why? But I don’t need his endorsement. I certainly wouldn’t want his endorsement. I don’t need anybody’s endorsement. I’m not looking for…" Heilemann: "Would you repudiate David Duke?" Trump: "Sure, I would do that if it made you feel better. I would certainly repudiate. I don’t know anything about him. Somebody told me yesterday, whoever he is, he did endorse me. And actually I don’t think it was an endorsement. He said I was absolutely the best of all the candidates. But I wouldn’t want him …" 2000 Trump: Duke is ‘a big racist’ Fifteen years ago, when Trump was flirting with a White House bid as a Reform Party candidate, he named Duke as a cause of concern at least three times. In 2000, former wrestler and then-Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura broke with the Reform Party because he didn’t want to be associated with the Reform Party’s presidential candidate Pat Buchanan, whom Duke supported. "Buchanan is an anti-abortion extremist and an unrealistic isolationist," Ventura told the New York Daily News on Feb. 12, 2000. "The latest I hear is that he's now getting support from David Duke. I can't be a part of that and I won't be part of that." Before he called it quits, Ventura said he consulted with Trump. After Ventura left the party, Trump also named Duke as one of the Reform's "biggest problems" on NBC’s Today Show. "Well, you've got David Duke just joined — a big racist, a problem. I mean, this is not exactly the people you want in your party," Trump said on Feb. 14, 2000. He announced that day that he wouldn’t seek the nomination of the Reform Party, naming Duke as one of his reasons. "Now I understand that David Duke has decided to join the Reform Party to support the candidacy of Pat Buchanan," Trump wrote in a statement. "So the Reform Party now includes a Klansman, Mr. Duke, a Neo-Nazi, Mr. Buchanan, and a Communist, Ms. Fulani. This is not company I wish to keep." A few days later, Trump himself quit the party and repeated his earlier statement. "Although I am totally comfortable with the people in the New York Independence Party, I leave the Reform Party to David Duke, Pat Buchanan and Lenora Fulani. That is not company I wish to keep," Trump wrote in a Feb. 19, 2000, New York Times op-ed. 1991 Trump: A vote for Duke is ‘an anger vote’ Even earlier, Trump appeared on CNN on Nov. 19, 1991, and discussed Duke’s defeat in the Louisiana governor’s race and his possibly running against then-President George H.W. Bush. (Duke declared his candidacy as a Republican about a month after Trump’s interview.) Larry King: "Did the David Duke thing bother you? Fifty-five percent of the whites in Louisiana voted for him. Four hundred New Yorkers contributed." Trump: "I hate seeing what it represents, but I guess it just shows there's a lot of hostility in this country. There's a tremendous amount of hostility in the United States." King: "Anger?" Trump: "It's anger. I mean, that's an anger vote. People are angry about what's happened. People are angry about the jobs. If you look at Louisiana, they're really in deep trouble. When you talk about the East Coast — it's not the East Coast. It's the East Coast, the middle coast, the West Coast." King: "If he runs and Pat Buchanan runs, might you see a really divided vote?" Trump: "Well, I think if they run, or even if David Duke — I mean, George (H.W.) Bush was very, very strong against David Duke. I think if he had it to do again, he might not have gotten involved in that campaign because I think David Duke now, if he runs, takes away almost exclusively Bush votes and then a guy like (Mario) Cuomo runs. I think Cuomo can win the election." King: "But Bush morally had to come out against him." Trump: "I think Bush had to come out against him. I think Bush — if David Duke runs, David Duke is going to get a lot of votes. Whether that be good or bad, David Duke is going to get a lot of votes." Our ruling Trump said, "I don't know anything about David Duke." Trump seems to have forgotten that he knew enough about Duke to denounce him twice this election cycle. In 2000, he knew enough to criticize Duke’s racism. And in 1991, he knew enough to say he hated what votes for Duke represented. We rate Trump’s claim Pants on Fire!

pomt-05025	"We are not producing jobs. We created 80,000 jobs last month. We don't talk about the jobs that we lost. The net of it all is that we lost jobs."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jul/15/joseph-kyrillos/joe-kyrillos-claims-united-states-not-producing-jo/	Joe Kyrillos rejects the term "Bush tax cuts." Rather, the Republican U.S. Senate hopeful casts the looming expiration of lower federal tax rates -- enacted under former President George W. Bush -- as tax increases the country can’t afford. That’s his argument considering the jobs market, which Kyrillos erroneously claimed in a recent interview is not growing. "If we don’t take action there will be tax increases and I guess we would call them [President Barack] Obama tax increases or [U.S. Sen.] Bob Menendez tax increases," Kyrillos, a state senator who is challenging Menendez this November, said in a July 11 interview on WNYC’s The Brian Lehrer Show. "Here's the thing: our economy is not performing. We are not producing jobs. We created 80,000 jobs last month. We don't talk about the jobs that we lost. The net of it all is that we lost jobs. And so listen, raising taxes now in these times is not going to help with job creation." Actually, the nation is adding jobs and has been for more than 20 months. So what is Kyrillos -- who has been traversing New Jersey on a "statewide jobs tour" -- talking about? "Our country has 4.894 million fewer jobs than we did at the start of the recession. That is the net job loss the Senator was referring to," Chapin Fay, Kyrillos’ campaign manager, said in a written statement. Federal labor statistics confirm the country shed nearly 4.9 million jobs since December 2007, the official start of the recession, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. But since June 2009 -- the official end of the recession -- the nation added nearly 2.6 million jobs. So to support his claim that the "net of it all is that we lost jobs," Kyrillos includes all of the job losses incurred during the recession. Fay said the point Kyrillos was "making is that we still have lost a lot of jobs since the recession and are not replenishing them fast enough. That is the context of his sentence and that is factually correct." But Kyrillos didn’t make any reference to that time frame in the interview, as he explained why the economy can’t now afford a tax increase. And the fact is the trend has reversed since the end of the recession. Though it may not be the growth Kyrillos or the rest of the country would like, the nation added 80,000 jobs in June, according to preliminary estimates. Fay said in his statement that "the 12.7 million Americans currently unemployed are certainly not reassured by the measly 80,000 jobs netted last month." But there still has been job growth. The nation has added more jobs than it lost every month since October 2010. In the private-sector, job growth has been sustained even longer, with gains every month since March 2010. Year over year, the country added more than 1.7 million jobs overall from June 2011 to June 2012. Over the same time frame, more than 1.9 million private-sector jobs were added. Our ruling Kyrillos said "we are not producing jobs. We created 80,000 jobs last month. We don't talk about the jobs that we lost. The net of it all is that we lost jobs." The country is producing jobs. To suggest otherwise is wrong. Kyrillos’ campaign manager said the Republican candidate was referring to total job losses dating back to December 2007, the start of the recession, when he said "the net of it all is that we lost jobs." But Kyrillos doesn’t make that distinction during the interview. The nation has sustained monthly job growth since October 2010. And year over year, more than 1.7 million jobs were added. We rate this claim False. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.	None	Joseph Kyrillos	None	None	None	2012-07-15T07:30:00	2012-07-11	['None']
pomt-12913	Obamacare "is in what the actuaries call a death spiral."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/jan/18/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-wrongly-claims-actuaries-have-determined/	As Republicans in Washington move toward a repeal of Obamacare, U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan is doubling down on criticism of the sweeping healthcare law. That included a description in his Jan. 12, 2017, weekly briefing about the current state of Obamacare. "The law is in what the actuaries tell us (is) a death spiral," the Wisconsin Republican said. "So we’ve got to intervene to prevent this from getting worse." Ryan used the same ominous term — death spiral — in his Jan. 5, 2017, weekly briefing and as far back as a Fox News interview in December 2016. But is it accurate? Death spiral has a precise meaning The phrase "death spiral" evokes an airplane in a nosedive, but in the world of health care it carries a specific definition. Ryan appears to be referring to that definition since each time he used the term, he attributed it to actuaries. So this isn’t a fact check on the health or success of Obamacare, but on whether the present condition is consistent with what industry number-crunchers call a "death spiral." The term refers to a cycle where shrinking enrollment leads to a deteriorating risk pool (that is, healthy people leave the plan due to the cost). That leads to higher premiums, which causes enrollment to shrink even further, continuing the cycle. "It’s a well-known and documented phenomenon," said David Cutler, a Harvard University economics professor who was among the early users of the term in a 1998 paper, though he doesn’t believe he was the first. Three elements to a death spiral So a death spiral requires 1.) shrinking enrollment, 2.) a deteriorating risk pool and 3.) rising premiums. Let’s look at those one by one. The latest figures show enrollment in the Affordable Care Act’s insurance exchange is up slightly from last year. Through Dec. 24, 2016, some 11.5 million people were signed up for coverage, an increase of 300,000 from the same point last year. "This market is not merely stable, it’s actually currently on track to grow," said Aviva Aron-Dine, an economist with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. "These (death spiral claims) are claims that have been sort of demonstrably false for a while, but it’s even more irresponsible to be repeating them now when we actually have enrollment data for 2017." As for the risk pool, Aron-Dine said it improved in 2015. Data for 2016 isn’t available yet, but the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reports the share of people signing up for 2017 in the low-risk demographic — ages 18-34 — is on par with 2016, at 26% of enrollees. Larry Levitt, vice president of the health care-focused, nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, noted the 26% number in a Jan. 10, 2017, tweet, adding, "You'd expect that number to go down in an insurance ‘death spiral.’" And data maintained by Standard & Poor’s shows the pool of people insured through the marketplace is improving, as the insurer cost per enrollee dropped below costs in the employer-sponsored market for the first time since Obamacare began, said Ben Wanaker, deputy assistant secretary with HHS. The role of premiums is more nuanced. Premiums are going up significantly this year. The benchmark plan used to gauge changes increased an average of 24% across the 50 states and Washington, D.C., the Kaiser Family Foundation reported. But most consumers won’t see any increase in what they pay because Obamacare includes subsidies that cap premium prices at a certain percentage of income for anyone below 400% of the federal poverty level (in 2016 that would be $47,520 for a single person). Among the people who have signed up so far for 2017, 81% will receive a subsidy. As a result, for most there is no direct connection between premiums and enrollment — the core connection that defines a death spiral. For example, Arizona has by far the largest premium increase for 2017 (145%) but has still seen Obamacare enrollment increase by 8 percent so far. "When the premiums go up, people don’t drop coverage because the amount they pay hasn’t changed," Cutler said. When asked for evidence of the death spiral, Ryan spokesman Ian Martorana provided links to other people who have claimed the system is in a death spiral and details on how premiums are rising and insurers are leaving the marketplace. But he did not provide any data that showed the conditions being met for the actuarial definition of a death spiral. None of this is to say things are rosy for Obamacare. Several of the country’s largest insurers have abandoned or drastically scaled back their involvement in the exchanges, meaning one-third of counties will now have only one company offering plans on the exchange. But that’s not a death spiral. Mark Pauly, a conservative health economist at The Wharton School, said it was a "poor choice of words" by Ryan. "It’s not a death spiral, it’s just a downward spiral," he said. Our rating A death spiral is a health industry term for a cycle with three components — shrinking enrollment, healthy people leaving the system and rising premiums. The latest data shows enrollment is increasing slightly and younger (typically healthier) people are signing up at the same rate as last year. And while premiums are increasing, that isn’t affecting the cost to most consumers due to built-in subsidies. So none of the three criteria are met, much less all three. We rate Ryan’s claim False.

pomt-02391	"If you rent a U-Haul to move your company, it costs twice as much to go from San Francisco to Austin than the other way around, because you can’t find enough trucks to flee the Golden State."	true	/texas/statements/2014/mar/12/rick-perry/rick-perry-correct-trucks-cost-half-much-rent-goin/	Texas Gov. Rick Perry, you may recall, isn’t impressed by states led by Democratic governors, including New York and California. Perry, who may run for president again in 2016, delivered a curiously focused dig in his well-received remarks at the Conservative Political Action Conference on March 7, 2014, saying another sign of things going well in red states and not so much in blue states lies in the relative costs of hauling stuff in a truck between blue California and red Texas. "If you rent a U-Haul to move your company, it costs twice as much to go from San Francisco to Austin than the other way around, because you can’t find enough trucks to flee the Golden State," Perry said with a grin. Notably, Perry did not say it’s cheaper to live in the city by the bay. According to an online Bankrate.com cost-of-living calculator, someone earning $53,000 a year in Austin would need nearly $92,000 a year to maintain their standard of living in San Francisco. Conversely, someone getting by on $53,000 a year in San Francisco could absorb a 42 percent income cut and still enjoy an equivalent standard of living in Austin, according to the calculator. Setting aside cost-of-living differences, was Perry right about the relative truck rental rates? By email, Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed suggested we check rates for ourselves. We followed Nashed’s suggested methodology: "1. Go to www.uhaul.com 2. Pick a date, any date (tomorrow, a week from now, the 27th… whatever) 3. Austin zip code 78701, San Francisco zip code 94114." Upshot: Perry appears to be onto something. On the afternoon after Perry’s speech, we checked online U-Haul rental rates for five different-length trucks for four dates: March 8, March 19, March 30 and April 28, 2014. We also checked the rates for rentals from Austin’s central 78701 ZIP code to San Francisco’s 94102, which is downtown. The rates for each truck did not change by date--and each Austin-to-San Francisco rate was at least half its comparable San Francisco-to-Austin rate. The biggest difference, according to our search, was for renting a 26-foot truck. For that truck, the Austin-to-San Francisco rate, $931, was 39 percent of the $2,383 rate for renting such a truck and driving the other way. (See our chart here.) Wondering if U-Haul is unique in this price contrast, we spot-checked the rental of a Penske truck for March 19, 2014; it would cost $448 to rent a Penske truck in Austin and return it in South San Francisco in comparison to costing nearly $1,487 to take a truck the other direction. Next, we asked Nashed how Perry concluded that the price difference ties to there not being enough U-Haul trucks to flee the Golden State. By email, Nashed pointed out a question and answer posted on U-Haul’s website. Question: "Why does it cost less to move from Point A to Point B than vice versa?" U-Haul’s answer: "Many variables go into establishing rates. There are times when more people are moving out of a city than into it. Because we want more equipment going back to that city we will often discount the rate." To our emailed inquiry, Ashleigh Wagner, a spokeswoman for U-Haul International, Inc., echoed that online answer without directly addressing the Austin-San Francisco contrast. Our ruling Perry said: "If you rent a U-Haul to move your company, it costs twice as much to go from San Francisco to Austin than the other way around, because you can’t find enough trucks to flee the Golden State." His rate contrast is spot-on--with the difference even wider for renting a big truck. U-Haul generally says rate differences reflect its need to keep equipment available to customers everywhere. We rate this claim as True.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2014-03-12T11:17:16	2014-03-07	['San_Francisco', 'Austin,_Texas']
pomt-07724	Says the high-speed rail project provides "short-term jobs."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/mar/03/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-says-high-speed-rail-jobs-wont-last/	Florida Gov. Rick Scott made time during his two-day promotional tour of northern U.S. cities on March 2, 2011, to stop into New York's Fox News studios and talk high-speed rail. In an interview with Fox & Friends host Steve Doocy, Scott first brushed off a lawsuit filed by two state senators challenging the new governor's ability to unilaterally kill the project. "I represent the taxpayers," he said. "This doesn't make any sense." Doocy then asked if a high-speed train is "really what people need." But before Scott could answer, Doocy said the project would provide jobs, right? "Short-term jobs," Scott said. "The federal government gives you all this money and then you have to pay for it down the road." In a previous item, we checked a claim from U.S. Rep. Corrine Brown, D-Jacksonville, that the rail line from Tampa to Orlando would create 60,000 jobs and rated that False. This time, we wanted to drill down on Scott's assertion that the jobs created would be "short-term jobs." For starters, we should note that estimating job numbers is a little bit like estimating ridership figures when it comes to the Tampa-Orlando train. There is science to it, of course, but there is a bit of art, too. Nevertheless, the Florida Department of Transportation provided a detailed job-creation estimate (page 16) as part of its application to the federal government for high-speed rail funding in October 2009. The state was awarded $2.4 billion in federal money for the $2.7 billion project, the money that Scott rejected. The job estimates are spread out over the four-county area along the 84-mile high-speed line, covering Hillsborough, Polk, Orange and Osceola counties. The 2009 application was based on a four-year construction period, beginning in 2011, and broke down the jobs created into three basic categories -- construction, engineering services and operations/maintenance. The estimate includes direct jobs -- those directly hired as a result of the project -- and indirect jobs, which FDOT said are jobs created to support the suppliers of the materials and equipment to the project. FDOT concluded that the rail line would create a total of 48,800 direct and indirect jobs over the construction of the system and another 1,100 total jobs once the line is in operation. (FDOT predicted the line would start running in 2015.) The jobs are measured in job-years, which is different than how most people would classify a job. The idea is that a "job" equals a year someone is employed -- that's a job-year. It could be one person working a year, or two people working six months each, or some other combination. In counting job-years, FDOT adds each year's job total to create one big number. It's a perfectly valid calculation -- as long as you understand the difference -- but to many, it comes off as a way to inflate the impact of a project. Here's how the FDOT breaks down the job creation in job-years: Employment (job-years) 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Construction Direct 2,100 9,700 9,000 1,000 0 Total 4,500 20,400 18,900 2,100 0 Engineering Services Direct 700 500 0 0 0 Total 1,700 1,200 0 0 0 Operations/Maintenance Direct 0 0 0 0 600 Total 0 0 0 0 1,100 Total Direct 2,800 10,200 9,000 1,000 600 Total Overall 6,200 21,600 18,900 2,100 1,100 After 2015, FDOT says, the operations and maintenance jobs would continue (600 direct, 1,100 total) while the construction-related work would not. In the most favorable light, that's a total of roughly 50,000 job-years spread out over five years, with 1,100 of those jobs continuing in perpetuity. But 40,500 of those jobs -- more than 80 percent -- are confined to just two years during the rail construction, 2012 and 2013. Scott said the high-speed rail project provides "short-term jobs." He's largely right. More than 80 percent of the jobs created (talking job-years again) only exist for two years, and 98 percent of the jobs last no more than four years while the rail's being built. That leaves just 1,100 direct and indirect jobs created as a result of the operation of the train that are truly permanent. We rate Scott's claim Mostly True.

pomt-04174	"In the last 15 years, we've witnessed a dramatic expansion in the jailing of immigrants, from about 70,000 people detained annually to about 400,000."	true	/georgia/statements/2012/dec/17/aclu-georgia-foundation/group-says-number-detainees-has-skyrocketed-15-yea/	The American Civil Liberties Union estimates the federal government spends $1.7 billion a year to detain illegal immigrants, which the group thinks is a waste of money. The ACLU Foundation of Georgia recently sent out a news release that decried the spending, made complaints about inadequate staffing levels and claimed some detainees are being mistreated at federal facilities, including the Stewart Detention Center in southwest Georgia. There was one set of numbers included in the release about detainees nationally that PolitiFact Georgia wanted to fact-check. "In the last 15 years, we've witnessed a dramatic expansion in the jailing of immigrants, from about 70,000 people detained annually to about 400,000," the release said. The liberal-leaning foundation has used these estimates in other news releases. We wondered whether the claim was correct, or is the ACLU using inflated numbers to bolster its argument? Azadeh N. Shahshahani, director of the foundation’s National Security/Immigrants' Rights Project, said it based the claim off reports it has seen. We found lots of information detailing the current number of detainees. The data for detainees held 15 years ago? Not so easy to find. In 1996, Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. Under the law, any person entering the United States illegally will be barred from entering the country legally for five years. A person who enters the United States illegally again and is caught will be banned from entering legally for 20 years. Federal reports we reviewed show there’s been an increase in the number of illegal immigrants detained since the law was passed. The federal government says it has put a greater emphasis on enforcement, spent more on beds to house detainees, given more money to states toward the effort and has a policy of mandatory detention of illegal immigrants accused of serious crimes. "The detention budget has increased, and our ability to detain more people has similarly increased," U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman Vincent Picard said. The federal government uses a 12-month budget cycle that begins Oct. 1 and ends Sept. 30. For fiscal year 2011, which covered Oct. 1, 2010, to Sept. 30, 2011, there were 429,247 illegal immigrants detained by the federal government, according to ICE. Detainees were held an average of nearly 30 days, ICE data show. The average daily population was 33,330. Picard said annual data go back to 2001. That year, 204,459 detainees were held. ICE keeps data on the average number of detainees held each day going back to 1994, we found. Part of the difficulty in tracking these numbers is the federal government reorganized its immigration enforcement under the Department of Homeland Security in 2003, abolishing the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which tracked immigration data. So where did the earlier estimate come from? Shahshahani said the ACLU found it on several websites, which she shared with us. Indeed, the estimate of 70,000 detainees held in the mid-1990s is included in various blogs by human rights organizations. None, however, contained the source of the claim. Shahshahani suggested the annual total is likely still accurate if you look at the annual figures since 2001. "Obviously, the daily figure has increased, so, possibly, the same extrapolation can be made of the annual figures," she said. Typically, the average daily detainee figures are about one-tenth the total of the annual figure. In 1995, the year before the law was passed, federal data show an average of 7,475 detainees were held. PolitiFact Georgia did some more digging and found a U.S. Justice Department report that backs up the ACLU Foundation’s claim. The report covered fiscal years 1994 to 2001. "The number of aliens ordered detained and taken into the custody of the INS pending removal from the United States or other outcome of an immigration proceeding increased from 72,154 during FY 1994 to 188,547 during FY 2001," the report said. Picard, the ICE spokesman, said he wouldn’t dispute the Justice Department report. To sum up, the ACLU Foundation of Georgia claimed the number of federal detainees has increased in the past 15 years from about 70,000 to 400,000. The 400,000 estimate seems accurate. One federal estimate from the mid-1990s corroborates the foundation’s argument. We rate the claim True.	None	ACLU Foundation of Georgia	None	None	None	2012-12-17T06:00:00	2012-12-07	['None']
pomt-10902	Says the Koch Brothers sponsored "a study that shows that Medicare for All would save the American people $2 trillion over a 10-year period."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/aug/03/bernie-sanders/did-conservative-study-show-big-savings-bernie-san/	When a free-market think tank published its analysis of Sen. Bernie Sanders’ single-payer health care plan, Republicans took to social media to tout the report’s most eye-popping finding. Sanders’ Medicare for All would cost $32.6 trillion over 10 years, an amount they framed as crushingly large. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Sanders, however, found good news for his idea in the generally skeptical report. In a video he shared on social media July 30, he pointed out one of the report’s findings that others had overlooked. Sanders tweaked the Koch brothers, the conservative donor family that has supported the Mercatus Center at George Mason University in Virginia. Sanders said, "Let me thank the Koch Brothers of all people for sponsoring a study that shows that Medicare for All would save the American people $2 trillion over a 10-year period. … That is what is in the study of the Mercatus Center." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Sanders’ plan would essentially expand Medicare to cover everyone, rather than just those older than 65. Individuals (and their employers) would no longer need to shoulder co-pays for medical care or premiums for private insurance coverage. Instead, the government would pay everyone’s medical bills. Sanders and his allies say this would end up saving money, because it would remove the middle-man of insurance companies, which drive up administrative costs, and and enable the government to use new bargaining power to rein in costs by providers. Skeptics counter that those savings are not guaranteed, and the lack of a monetary incentive for patients to hold back on services could lead to increased use of the system, adding to the overall cost. In addition, with the government having to raise revenue to pay everyone’s bills, taxes and the federal debt could go dangerously high, potentially canceling out or exceeding the money that individuals and families would save in higher take-home pay and lower health-care expenses. In this article, we’ll look at something much more narrow: whether Sanders is right that the Mercatus report says that single-payer would save the United States $2 trillion in health care outlays. In a way, Sanders is right, though his assertion glosses over some caveats. Where the $2 trillion estimate comes from The Mercatus report included a table summarizing the financial effects of Sanders’ bill. With a minimum of arithmetic, it’s not hard to find the $2 trillion in question. It’s the difference between the Department of Health and Human Services’ projection of the amount of total health care spending in the United States, and what Mercatus thinks that number would be under Sanders’ Medicare for All proposal. (See Table 2.) Under Mercatus’ projection for Medicare for All, the total amount of health expenditures would actually fall compared to what is expected under a continuation of the current system. Specifically, total health care expenditures would fall by $2.054 trillion over 10 years, according to Mercatus. So there’s definitely something to what Sanders said. Some reasons for pause The Mercatus report’s author took issue with Sanders’ focus on that figure. Charles Blahous said that to come up with that estimate, Mercatus used a relatively generous assumption about how well Sanders’ plan will end up controlling health care costs. It assumes that provider payment will be reduced to Medicare levels, that negotiation with prescription drugmakers will generate significant savings, and that administrative costs will be cut from 13 to 6 percent. However, in an alternative scenario in which cost-control works less effectively (see Table 4) Mercatus found that over the same 10-year period, national health expenditures would actually increase by $3.252 trillion compared to current law. So while the number Sanders chose really does appear in the report, he’s cherry-picked the more flattering of two estimates. Sanders’ bill "indicates that health providers would be paid at Medicare’s payment rates, which are about 40 percent lower than those paid by private insurance," Blahous said. "Obviously, immediately cutting payments to health care providers by roughly 40 percent would lower national health spending." But would cuts that large actually occur (and without other negative consequences, such as mass retirements of doctors unwilling to accept lower fees)? This is where independent experts express caution. Sustained cuts as deep as those projected in the Mercatus model Sanders pointed to are "not likely feasible," said John Holahan, a fellow in the health policy center at the Urban Institute. His Urban Institute colleague, Linda Blumberg, agreed, saying it’s a "pretty heroic assumption to say that you can dial payment rates down to those levels system-wide politically." In addition, even if the switch to Medicare for All does end up cutting the total amount of money spent on health care in the United States, the legislation places more of those costs on the federal budget. In an era of rising debt and an aging Baby Boom generation, that could be a problem. Josh Miller-Lewis, a spokesman for Sanders, focused instead on the impact on individuals, many of whom will end up ahead. "Under Medicare for All with a progressive tax system, the vast majority of people will save money on health care," he said. Our ruling In cheekily thanking the Koch brothers, Sanders said a study they indirectly sponsored "shows that Medicare for All would save the American people $2 trillion over a 10-year period." The $2 trillion figure can be traced back to the Mercatus report. But it is one of two scenarios the report offers, so Sanders’ use of the term "would" is too strong. The alternative figure, which assumes that a Medicare for All plan isn’t as successful in controlling costs as its sponsors hope it will be, would lead to an increase of almost $3.3 trillion in national health care expenditures, not a decline. Independent experts say the alternative scenario of weaker cost control is at least as plausible. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-02570	Says President Barack Obama "spent nearly a trillion dollars on make-work government jobs."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/30/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-barack-obama-spent-nearly-trillion-/	Even though the stimulus enacted by President Barack Obama in 2009 has been phased out for a few years now, it remains a talking point for some Republican critics. During his response to Obama’s State of the Union address, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., took a shot at the stimulus when he said this: "Mr. President," Paul said, "where are the jobs? You spent nearly a trillion dollars on make-work government jobs and still joblessness confronts the next generation." We wondered whether Paul -- a potential 2016 presidential candidate -- was correct to say that Obama "spent nearly a trillion dollars on make-work government jobs." First, some background on the stimulus, which was passed in 2009 with almost exclusive Democratic backing. When it was passed, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office expected more than 90 percent of the cost to occur within fiscal years 2009, 2010 and 2011. It has found that those expenditures have proceeded more or less on schedule. So far, the stimulus has spent $816 billion. One could characterize that as "nearly a trillion dollars," especially when you add in the debt incurred in order to make that spending possible. The estimate for the debt required to support the stimulus was $347 billion over 10 years, making the combination of the stimulus and the added debt a bit under $1.2 trillion. What’s more problematic about Paul’s claim is his charge that this money went toward "make-work government jobs." This claim is dubious on two levels. First, not all the stimulus money went to paying government employees -- only a modest (though uncertain) fraction did. The stimulus included three broad categories of spending, broken down below with the amount spent so far: • Tax benefits to individuals and businesses: $290.7 billion • Entitlements, including Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps and unemployment benefits: $264.4 billion • Contracts, grants and loans in such areas as education, transportation, infrastructure, energy, science and health: $261.2 billion So right off the bat, more than two-thirds of the total -- tax benefits and entitlement payments -- cannot be fairly categorized as funding "make-work government jobs." These were payments and tax givebacks for individuals and businesses to spend as they saw fit. The third category, worth $261.2 billion, did include funding for some government jobs, such as teachers, but a sizable chunk of this money was used by the government to fund work carried out by the private sector, such as road-building companies and hazardous-waste cleanup contractors. It’s also worth noting that neither the federal government nor government as a whole has seen a surge in employment. According to the Bureau of Labor Statsitics, the size of the federal workforce has declined by 69,000 since Obama took office, though it has risen by about 65,000 if cuts in the Postal Service workforce are not included. That’s about a 3 percent increase over a five-year period if you use the figures that exclude the Postal Service. The drop is even more clear in government jobs at all levels -- federal, state and local. Since Obama took office, government employment has plunged by 734,000 jobs, which is a decrease about 10 times bigger than the federal increase. Which brings us to the second concern: Not all of these government employees were engaged in "make work." Webster’s New World Dictionary defines "make work" as "a job, project or assignment that serves no useful purpose other than to give an otherwise idle or unemployed person something to do." The classic example is of paying an unemployed person to dig a hole, then to fill it up again. Whether something qualifies a "make work" is open to debate; critics of all ideological stripes can surely find examples of specific projects in the stimulus that they would consider unworthy of taxpayer support. Still, the biggest category of "contracts, grants and loans" -- accounting for more than one-third of this heading -- is education, and a big chunk of those funds, about $51 billion, went toward keeping previously employed educators from being laid off. Another $16 billion went to student financial aid, plus a combined $24 billion for educating disadvantaged and special-needs children. Since much of this funding went toward teachers who were already employed, and were in danger of being laid off, it seems hard to characterize their duties as "make work." When we checked with Paul’s office, aides offered a revised phrase to replace "make-work government jobs" -- namely, "government-facilitated job growth." This terminology would be more accurate; indeed, we’d expect to find little disagreement with this from Democrats who supported the stimulus. The stimulus was the keystone of Obama’s efforts to stop the nation’s economic freefall, while also accomplishing some other priorities in such areas as infrastructure and scientific research. Democrats tend to believe that government spending -- called "Keynesian" after its progenitor, the late economist John Maynard Keynes -- plays a major role in economic downturns in replacing vanished or reduced spending by the private sector. Some Republicans are skeptical of this approach, suggesting that tax cuts get more money into the hands of private individuals who can lead an economic recovery more effectively than the government can. We won’t referee that debate. Instead, we’ll note that we would have agreed there’s a good argument that Obama engaged in roughly $1 billion of "government-facilitated job growth." That, of course, begs the question of whether the payoff in job creation was worth the $1 trillion spent. Employment is up by 3.2 million since Obama was sworn in, but it remains almost 1.2 million below its peak, almost five years into the recovery. Our ruling Paul said Obama "spent nearly a trillion dollars on make-work government jobs." It’s plausible that through the stimulus, Obama spent nearly $1 trillion of taxpayer dollars in hopes it would create jobs. But Paul is wrong to suggest that all $1 trillion was spent on "make-work government jobs." Two-thirds of the stimulus was spent on tax cuts and entitlements, and of the remaining one-third, much was paid to private contractors. Only a modest fraction of the $1 trillion was spent on government jobs, much less on jobs spent doing nothing. We rate his claim False.

pomt-12621	Says former Sen. Rick Santorum said, "Sometimes pregnancy is God’s way of comforting rape victims."	false	/pennsylvania/statements/2017/apr/01/blog-posting/uspoln-puts-rape-pregnancy-words-ex-us-sen-rick-sa/	Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum has been a pro-life stalwart throughout his political career. He’s regularly said he would oppose abortion in all cases -- even incidents of rape and incest. But did he recently go so far as to say, "Sometimes pregnancy is God’s way of comforting rape victims?" According to Uspoln, a "U.S. political news" site with 23,000 Facebook likes (and some of the weirdest "you may also like" links of all time), Santorum made the comment on "Piers Morgan Live" in mid-February. It uses that quote as a headline and then presents further comments about abortion attributed to Santorum. Here’s the thing: Santorum didn’t give most of these comments in the way Uspoln presented them, and he certainly didn’t say them this year. Uspoln published the article Feb. 18, 2017. Its article states Santorum spoke to Piers Morgan "last Friday," which would have been Feb. 17. That is not possible. Morgan has been off the air since 2014. He is currently working as an editor for the Daily Mail. Now, during his time on CNN, Morgan did once host Santorum. During Santorum’s presidential run in 2012, he and his family appeared on the show, and Morgan asked him about abortion in cases of rape and incest. Uspoln’s article partially paraphrases and partially directly quotes Santorum. It says, "sexual assault victims should ‘accept this horribly created’ pregnancy because it is ‘nevertheless a gift in a very broken way’ and that, when it comes down to it, a victim ‘just has to make the best out of a bad situation.’" Uspoln also quotes Santorum and Morgan having an exchange in which Santorum compares a pregnancy through rape to a suicide bombing. This is the full statement Santorum made to Morgan, according to a transcript from the show: "As horrible as the way that that son or daughter and son was created, it still is her child. And whether she has that child or doesn't, it will always be her child. And she will always know that. And so to embrace her and to love her and to support her and get her through this very difficult time, I've always, you know, I believe and I think the right approach is to accept this horribly created -- in the sense of rape -- but nevertheless a gift in a very broken way, the gift of human life, and accept what God has given to you. As you know, we have to, in lots of different aspects of our life. We have horrible things happen. I can't think of anything more horrible. But, nevertheless, we have to make the best out of a bad situation." According to the transcript, the conversation between Santorum and Morgan about suicide bombing and a pregnancy from a rape did not occur. Santorum’s remarks did lead to some backlash in 2012. An opinion writer for The Guardian, for instance, wrote a critical story on Santorum with the headline, "Rick Santorum thinks pregnancy through rape is God’s gift? Seriously?" Uspoln did not respond to an interview request. The site appears to regularly twist and embellish the words of famous politicians and then publish or re-publish the articles months after the comments were made. For example, after a Sarah Palin Facebook post about Black Lives Matter caused controversy last summer, Uspoln ran an article falsely claiming Palin said, "I’m sick of being called a racist. If it’s dangerous for blacks here, they can go back to Africa." Our ruling The website Uspoln claimed Rick Santorum said, "Sometimes pregnancy is God’s way of comforting rape victims" and also made other comments comparing suicide bombing and pregnancies because of rape in February 2017 on a TV show with Piers Morgan. "Piers Morgan Live" has not been on television since 2014 and in a 2012 interview with Morgan, Santorum made no such comments. Though he did say pregnancy from a rape should be "approached...as a gift in a very broken way," Santorum did not say pregnancy was "God’s way of comforting rape victims" and made no comparisons to suicide bombing. We rule the claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/217c286c-c3a4-4b7a-94f0-202ed85b3329	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2017-04-01T21:05:59	2017-02-18	['Rick_Santorum', 'God']
pomt-03601	Says he has sued the Obama administration 25 times.	true	/texas/statements/2013/may/10/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-says-he-has-sued-obama-administration-/	Here’s a typical workday for Texas’ attorney general: "I go into the office, I sue the federal government and I go home," Greg Abbott was quoted as saying to a tea party group in an April 30, 2013, Associated Press news story. Speaking to FreedomWorks Texas in Austin on April 27, Abbott said, "I’ve sued the Obama administration now 25 times, over the last four years." Last fall, the Associated Press tallied two dozen: Abbott "has filed 24 lawsuits against the federal government since Obama took office — litigation that has cost the state $2.58 million and more than 14,113 hours spent by staff and state lawyers working those cases," said a Sept. 9, 2012, news story. Abbott spokeswoman Lauren Bean emailed us an updated list of Texas’ lawsuits against the federal government: three during President George W. Bush’s tenure and 27 since President Barack Obama’s Jan. 20, 2009, inauguration. (Abbott himself was sworn in Dec. 2, 2002.) Outcomes of the 27 Obama-era lawsuits, by our count: five clear-cut "wins," eight "losses," four cases in which Texas agreed to dismiss its case when circumstances changed, nine cases in progress -- and one that could be called a partial win, perhaps: 2010’s 26-state challenge to Obamacare that ended with the Supreme Court declaring it was legal to tax individuals without health care, but states could not be required to expand Medicaid. Abbott’s staff, Bean said, would count eight "wins" during the Obama administration, including the Medicaid decision and two dismissals in which "the state got what it wanted." Bean noted all but one "win" are final (can no longer be appealed) and of the eight "losses," she said, six are being appealed and one could be appealed. In our count of five "wins," four lawsuits were against the Environmental Protection Agency and one against the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The EPA has appealed one ruling to the Supreme Court, and FERC filed for a clarification of the judgment in its case. In most of the 27 cases, Texas was the lead plaintiff or only plaintiff. These included lawsuits in which Abbott was acting at the request of a department or branch of Texas state government. Bean said, "We file them on behalf of state agencies. We’re the lawyer, they’re the client." Twice, Texas was originally listed among other states but not as the lead plaintiff, and in 11 cases Texas and other states or parties filed similar lawsuits that were bundled together by the courts sometimes resulting in Texas not being listed as the lead, or original, plaintiff. Both cases in which Texas was an original plaintiff but not the lead plaintiff involved challenges to Obamacare: the 2010 lawsuit by 26 states that ended with the Supreme Court declaring it was legal to tax individuals without health care and the 2012 case in which seven states sued over a requirement that religious employers offer insurance covering certain birth control methods. For perspective, we reached Stefanie Lindquist, associate dean for external affairs at the University of Texas Law School with a specialty in empirical legal studies. Lindquist told us by phone that she would not attach much significance to those circumstances when trying to determine whether Texas was itself suing the federal government agency. "This is situations where they’re actually named parties in the suit," she said, rather than, for example, filing a brief lending support to one side. States’ attorneys general often join forces to challenge laws, she said, as in the Obamacare lawsuit that eventually included 26 states. (Texas was among 14 states listed as plaintiffs in the original suit, filed by Florida.) "They’re lending resources, so it’s not that Texas is not a real litigant," Lindquist said. Even when later joining other plaintiffs, she said, "I don’t think that means they’re not a plaintiff, I just think it means they’re one of many." Democratic activist Matt Angle, whom we asked to weigh in, did object to Abbott’s inclusion of the two multi-state Obamacare lawsuits. But he raised a larger objection: the inclusion of two cases in which Texas sought preclearance under the federal Voting Rights Act for changes to its voting process. Angle, founder of the Washington, D.C.-based Lone Star Project, told us by email that in filing these suits, Abbott "took action as a defensive and not offensive tactic. ... No way he should get credit in these two instances." Under the Voting Rights Act, governments in certain jurisdictions (notably, several Southern states) where minority voter turnout was previously low must get federal clearance before changes in voting laws can take effect. To get that clearance, Lindquist said, "you have a choice of two different avenues. One is you can request the preclearance of the election law change with the Department of Justice via letter. … Or, you can go to court to seek the preclearance" by the action of filing a lawsuit. During the Obama administration, Texas has sought preclearance twice in high-profile cases -- in 2011, for redrawn legislative voting districts, and in 2012, for a measure requiring voters to show photo identification at the polls. In those cases, Lindquist said, "to say yes, that the State of Texas sued the government, yes that’s true." But looking at the main purpose of such suits, she said, "it’s not quite the same as suing the government to force the government to change its behavior. They’re suing the federal government to seek preclearance under a federal law, and they’re just going to a different forum to do it." Our ruling Abbott said, "I’ve sued the Obama administration now 25 times." Since Obama became president, Texas has filed or been a party to 27 lawsuits against the federal government. This statement is True.	None	Greg Abbott	None	None	None	2013-05-10T17:14:10	2013-04-27	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-00975	In the past year, DeKalb has "attracted and retained more than 2,300 jobs."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2015/feb/13/lee-may/dekalb-jobs-claim-needs-some-refining/	With economic indicators ticking up in Georgia and headlines of new jobs coming to metro Atlanta, the state’s third-largest county is touting its successes. DeKalb County has "attracted and retained more than 2,300 jobs" in the last year, interim CEO Lee May told business and community leaders during his State of the County address last month. May went on to describe his efforts to improve the county’s image to attract businesses and support job growth. But PolitiFact Georgia wondered, could the county often in the news for corruption allegations and political gridlock also be responsible for growing jobs? We decided to check. May directed us to DeKalb Workforce Development, the local agency that provides "one-stop" education, training and employment programs under the federal Workforce Investment Act. The agency keeps track of jobs in several categories, said Workforce Director Sheryl Stone. They are: Geographic Solutions: A statewide database that counts only full-time employees hired or retained through federal Department of Labor funds. In 2014, DeKalb saw 731 new hires in this category and 602 people who retained new jobs for at least a year. Total: 1,333. Capital Improvement Plan (CIP): A count of workers hired or retained, either part-time or full-time, as part of DeKalb’s $1.35 billion overhaul of its water/sewer system. Last year, 107 people were hired and 386 saw jobs retained as part of working for contractors on the program. Total: 493. Taleo: Employers who work on the county level to recruit for part-time and full-time jobs use DeKalb’s Taleo system to filter resumes. Some workers will transfer to the state Geographic Solutions system once they have completed probationary periods for full-time work. The county does not break out the number of jobs based on full-time or part-time in this category, but all are unsubsidized with government dollars. Total: 348. Job training: Workforce uses federal dollars to subsidize up to half of a new hire’s salary for 90 days. The employer recruits through the agency and must hire the employee at full time with benefits. The subsidy is designed to serve as a training cost. Total: 167. Stone said the agency determined that, over a 10-year period, the average salary for workers it helped find employment was $56,000. "We really are making a difference," she said. And, adding up the categories, Workforce counts 2,341 people working for the year. That would fully support May’s claim, except for hiccups with the counts themselves. The local Taleo category, for instance, counts part-time jobs as equal to those with full-time hours (which the county considers after only 32 hours). Job seekers are apt to view even 32 hours per week to be part-time, suggesting that category is inflated, according to experts. The bigger question is how Workforce is counting workers in the water/sewer overhaul. Stone said the agency counts workers as reported by the contractors selected for different projects. Some of those people may work only a few days or months on a specific task, Stone said, but they are included in the total headcount reported. The agency’s lead over the CIP said each worker is only counted once, though they may work on several tasks in a specific project. And, if someone is hired or keeps a job for three months, that person then counts as a full-time equivalent worker, though the agency does not have a breakdown of how many would fall into that category. That’s problematic, because the definitions can affect the counts, said Tom Smith, a finance professor at the Goizueta Business School at Emory University. For instance, a pizzeria can claim to have sold a pizza for every 8 slices it sells. But those slices may not come from the same whole pizza – meaning the count doesn’t adjust for what would have been thrown away from one whole pizza that had been divvied up. "You run into problems when you try to count things the same but in different ways," Smith said. "Four thousand people who work a quarter of the year is not really the same thing as 1,000 jobs." Barbara Neuby, a professor of political science at Kennesaw State University, said the massaged definitions also direct focus away from statistics that may not be as positive. For instance, state Department of Labor figures show that the number of new unemployment claims in DeKalb were down about 12 percent between December 2013 and December 2014. But the claims are up 44 percent between November and December last year, the last figures available. "If they wanted to be truly accountable and transparent, they could say they created work in the private sector by issuing contracts," said Neuby, who specializes in government budgets and finance. "But to say these are jobs created, no. We don’t have exact numbers to make that claim." May said the county plans to do a better job of counting positions in that category going forward. But, he notes that the work is creating jobs – something that the experts agree on in principle. "We spent $62 million on the CIP last year, and that translates into people who are working," May said. "We didn’t define that and we will drill down to be more probing about what kinds of jobs. To us, a job is a job if you’re working, it counts." To that end, May is correct. The state Labor Department defines a job simply as a task that is performed. The number of people employed to do that task can be less than full time, or more. So, was May on target when he said DeKalb had created or kept more than 2,300 jobs last year? By the state’s broad definitions, the county’s Workforce Development office backs him up on the number of people working. That’s not the same thing as the number of jobs. The distinction boils down to that difference. Looking at the categories, the bulk of the people being counted - those on the state level, in job training and some hired on the local level - are likely to be the same as the number of jobs. But for some people working part-time on the local level, or in the CIP, the distinction could boost or underestimate the actual number of jobs. Without more data, which the county does not collect, we don’t know what is happening. Overall, that means the statement is mostly right, except for problems the county acknowledges in its counts. We rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Lee May	None	None	None	2015-02-13T00:00:00	2015-01-22	['None']
pomt-14790	"15 years ago, cancer drugs cost an average of $10,000 a year. Now it’s $10,000 a month."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2015/dec/02/bill-maher/bill-maher-cancer-drugs-cost-10000-month/	Patients used to pay $10,000 a year for cancer drugs, but now they’re paying $10,000 a month, according to HBO talk show host Bill Maher. That’s a message circulating on Facebook recently, promoted by the "Bill Maher Fanpage." A reader asked us to check it out. The quote comes from the Oct. 2 episode of Real Time with Bill Maher, where Maher discussed Turing Pharmaceuticals, the company that jacked up the cost of a life-saving drug from $13.50 to $750 essentially overnight. "Not that (Turing CEO Martin) Shkreli is unusual for the pharmaceutical industry," Maher said on his show. "Fifteen years ago, cancer drugs cost an average of $10,000 a year. Now it’s $10,000 a month because this cartel owns the U.S. government every bit as much as Mexican drug lords own theirs." It’s well known that the cost of health care is on the rise, but has the annual cost of cancer drugs really increased so dramatically in just a decade and a half? Maher’s team sent us links to some news articles about the rising cost of cancer drugs, and we tracked down information that speaks to his claim. The best information we could nail down is the cost of anticancer drugs at launch, the initial price when the Federal Drug Administration approves a drug. These are the sticker prices set by the pharmaceutical companies, not the prices patients actually pay out of pocket, which are reduced by insurance payments, patient assistance programs and other discounts. Costs increases, though, are often passed on to consumers. Maher has a point that cancer drug costs are on the rise. We charted the launch costs of cancer drugs the FDA approved since 1999, using a list compiled by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. The second half of Maher’s statement -- that cancer drugs now cost about $10,000 a month -- is also on solid ground. Of drugs approved in 2015, the monthly average cost is $11,319. And experts in the field often cite that $10,000 figure themselves. Because many cancer drugs are not administered to patients for a full year, it’s difficult to determine an average annual cost, so the first half of Maher’s statement -- that they cost about $10,000 a year 15 years ago -- is hard to nail down. To his point, though, the monthly cost of a new drug was dramatically lower in 2000 than what it is now at about $4,634. One of the news articles that Maher’s team sent us is an academic article in the Journal of Oncology Practice that supports his statement. The report reads, "The average cancer drug price for approximately one year of therapy or a total treatment duration was less than $10,000 before 2000." Maher’s statement is "in the ballpark," if not an understatement, said Rena Conti, a health economist at the University of Chicago who researches cancer drug prices. In a 2015 paper Conti authored with three other leading health economists, she examined the launch cost of anticancer drugs controlled for inflation and the benefit to the patient (how much it prolongs life expectancy). For example, in 1995, anticancer drugs cost $54,100 for an additional year of life, the study found. In 2005, drugs cost $139,100 for the same benefit, and the price grew to $207,000 in 2013. In the United States, pharmaceutical companies set their own drug prices. What’s pushing them to increase the costs? It’s not necessarily that cancer drugs are getting better and are thus worth more. Conti’s research concluded that just about one-fifth of the cancer drug cost increase can be attributed to a better product. There are two primary forces behind annual cancer drug cost increases, Conti said: First, pharmaceutical companies estimate a "zone of indifference" -- based on last year’s prices, how much more would buyers be willing to pay? Second, rebates and discounts for drugs have also increased over time, and this creates an incentive for drug companies to increase their costs alongside the discounts. Pharmaceutical companies defend drug price increases by emphasizing that the revenue funds innovative research and that drugs lower overall health care costs by treating illnesses. Because there’s no formal price regulation and competition in the industry is rare, "It really is a system where there’s no downward pressure on drug prices," said Peter Bach, director of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Center for Health Policy and Outcomes in an interview with Fortune. Our ruling Maher said, "15 years ago, cancer drugs cost an average of $10,000 a year. Now it’s $10,000 a month." The average annual cost of a drug isn’t easy to calculate, given the way cancer drugs are scheduled; many drugs aren’t used every month for an entire year. So the first half of the statement is hard to verify, though we did find one academic source that cites a similar figure. However, Maher has a point that the cost of cancer drugs has increased dramatically since 2000, when the average monthly price of a cancer drug, when it first hit the market, was about $4,600. In 2015, the monthly cost is over $10,000. Maher’s numbers are a little squishy, but they’re in the ballpark. We rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-01529	The Obama administration is using as its "legal justification for these airstrikes (on the Islamic State), an authorization for military force that the president himself has called for repeal of."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/18/julie-pace/justify-airstrikes-against-islamic-state-obama-usi/	On Monday night, Jon Stewart took aim at President Barack Obama’s strategy to take down the Islamic State, highlighting the Obama administration’s mixed messages about whether or not their airstrikes were "sustained counterterrorism activities" or "war." "There are legal ramifications to this," Stewart said. "How we define the conflict will inform who has the authority to address the threat from ISIS-ISIL." Stewart then played a clip where Fox News’ John Roberts explains that "the president is relying on the Authorizations for Use of Military Force (AUMF) that President (George W.) Bush had signed in 2001 and 2002." After a ditty about Middle Eastern wars, Stewart played a clip where Obama said he "look(s) forward to engaging Congress and the American people in efforts to refine, and ultimately repeal, the AUMF’s mandate." "Wow, then you are lucky that Congress never does anything you ask, because otherwise you would be screwed right now," Stewart joked. This isn’t the first time Obama’s gotten flak on this: Associated Press reporter Julie Pace recently asked White House press secretary Josh Earnest about the "irony in using as your legal justification for these airstrikes an authorization for military force that the President himself has called for repeal of." So we wanted to check: Is Obama justifying his airstrikes using the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs, while arguing that he wants the same AUMF repealed? When can the president wage war? Under the War Powers Act of 1973, the president has the power to wage war for 60 days before an AUMF or a declaration of war is needed from Congress. Obama authorized airstrikes in Iraq against ISIS on Aug. 7, so to carry out what Obama called a "sustained counter-terrorism strategy" against the Islamic State, he will need some sort of legislation from Congress. That’s what Bush did in the immediate aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Congress passed an AUMF that gave the Bush the power to use "appropriate force" against anybody behind the attacks. That’s been understood to mean al-Qaida, and while the Islamic State used to be part of al-Qaida, they’ve since split over ideological differences and spats over leadership. Congress passed another AUMF in 2002 authorizing the Iraq War. But in his Sept. 10 speech about the Islamic State, Obama said, "I have the authority to address the threat from ISIL," meaning he believes that attacking ISIS is permitted under an existing AUMF, either from 2001 or 2002. Obama made a similar statement during a Sept. 7 Meet the Press interview, but in neither case has Obama explicitly said that he’s using the 2001 or 2002 AUMF to justify his actions. Others in the White House have been more clear Others in his administration, though, have named the 2001 AUMF specifically. When Pace drilled Earnest on "an AUMF he (Obama) wanted repealed," Earnest responded by calling it "an AUMF that he (Obama) believes continues to apply to this terrorist organization that is operating in Iraq and Syria." Various sources, included The New York Times and Time, have quoted a statement from a senior administration official provided to the media that specifically points to the 2001 AUMF as a justification for the U.S. airstrikes against ISIL. Even though al-Qaida and the Islamic State have formally split, the administration’s statement cites the group’s "long history of conducting … attacks against U.S. persons and interests, the extensive history of U.S. combat operations against ISIL … and ISIL’s position … that it is the true inheritor of Osama bin Laden’s legacy" as reasons why the 2001 AUMF applies. So although Obama himself hasn’t publicly named the 2001 AUMF, others in his administration have made it clear that he considers the legal justification for his airstrikes on the Islamic State. Missing context on Obama’s 'repeal' statement All that said, there’s no question that Obama said that he wanted the 2001 AUMF repealed. In a May 23, 2013, speech at the National Defense University -- from which Stewart got his clip -- Obama said that he looked "forward to engaging Congress and the American people in efforts to refine, and ultimately repeal, the AUMF’s mandate." Earlier, he notes that "the AUMF is now nearly 12 years old," so it’s clear that he’s referring to the 2001 AUMF. Honing in on the "repeal," though, oversimplifies Obama’s position. Pace’s formulation -- that Obama "has called for repeal of" the AUMF and that it's an "AUMF he wants repealed" -- implies that Obama wants the AUMF repealed immediately. That’s not the case. In the statement Pace was referring to, Obama said he wanted "to refine, and ultimately repeal, the AUMF’s mandate." So refining comes first, and repeal is somewhere down the road. Clarifying the timeline In fact, in the same speech, Obama mentioned his administration’s campaign against al-Qaida in the Arab Peninsula (AQAP) in Yemen, which his administration has justified using the 2001 AUMF. About a year after Obama’s 2013 statements about the AUMF, a senior administration official (unnamed in the White House transcript) put a more specific timeline on refining and repealing the AUMF. The Obama administration, said the official, will "want to talk to Congress about the AUMF as we approach the end of the year (2014)." And on Sept. 12, Earnest said that there had been "conversations between senior White House staffers and members of Congress" in response to a question about "revising, refining, or repealing the 2001 AUMF." There’s actually been more than just conversations: Since Obama’s 2013 speech, the House of Representatives has voted against two separate amendments from Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., that would have repealed the 2001 AUMF. But as far as we can tell, the Obama administration didn’t comment on those amendments. So repeal may be somewhere down the line, and the Obama administration has consistently stated they plan to change the 2001 AUMF, but saying Obama wants the 2001 AUMF repealed is an a bit of a simplification. Our ruling Pace said that the Obama administration is using as its "legal justification for these airstrikes (on the Islamic State), an authorization for military force that the president himself has called for repeal of," and several other publications have reiterated her point that Obama wanted the 2001 AUMF Pace is referring to repealed. There’s no doubt that the Obama administration is using the 2001 AUMF as its "legal justification." Obama hasn’t publicly named the 2001 AUMF, but his press secretary and a statement from a senior administration official have. Saying that Obama "called for repeal of" the 2001 AUMF, though, is an oversimplification. Obama said he wanted to work with Congress "to refine and, ultimately, repeal" the 2001 AUMF, meaning he wants it repealed eventually, but not now. Other statements by his administration have been consistent with that point of view. Pace’s statement could have used some additional clarification or detail, so we rate her claim Mostly True.

pomt-00378	Teacher pay has increased under Republican leadership every year for the past 5 years. In fact, even according to the national teacher's unions own rankings, NC ranked number 2 in the U.S. for fastest rising teacher pay 2016-2017.	mostly true	/north-carolina/statements/2018/sep/07/michael-lee/nc-senator-claims-teacher-pay-increased-under-repu/	Teacher pay is always a popular topic around election time. Republicans and Democrats either want credit for any progress being made, or want to blame the other side for any lack of progress. Sen. Michael Lee, a Republican from Wilmington, is gearing up for re-election against Harper Peterson, a former Wilmington mayor. He tweeted on Aug. 28 that "teacher pay has increased under Republican leadership every year for the past 5 years. In fact, even according to the national teacher’s unions own rankings, NC ranked number 2 in the U.S. for fastest rising teacher pay 2016-2017." Did teacher pay increase over the past five years? Here’s the average teacher salary from the past five years: 2013-14: $44,990 2014-15: $47,819 2015-16: $47,985 2016-17: $49,837 2017-18: $50,861 Those teacher salaries also include supplements, but those are provided by the local district and not the General Assembly. The numbers do not take into consideration any rise in health care premiums, cost-of-living or other expenses. The average rate of inflation over the course of these years was 2.3 percent, based on information from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. At first glance, it does appear that teachers got a pay raise every year. However, the salary schedules from the North Carolina Department of Instruction tell a slightly different story. Teachers with 35 years of experience were being paid $52,150 in the 2013-14 school year. In the 2014-15 school year, the base salary for teachers with 25 years of experience or more dropped to $50,000. The 2016 "Held Harmless" statute made sure no teacher would make less in 2016-17 than in 2014-15. So, those teachers did not receive a pay cut in the following years. The average pay did increase every year after the 2013-14 school year. In the 2017-18 academic year, teachers with 35 years of experience were paid $51,300. Basically, teachers who reach 35 years of experience today because they are now included in the overall "25-year-plus" category. (Clarification: An earlier version of this story said teachers received pay cuts following the 2013-14 academic year. However, we neglected to factor in the "Held Harmless" statute that prevents teacher pay cuts.) It’s the same story for teachers with 36 years of experience. They were paid $53,180 in the 2013-14 academic year, but teachers who reach 36 years of experience would’ve been paid $50,000 in the 2014-15 academic year. In the 2017-18 academic year, these teachers were paid $51,300 as well. The same "Held Harmless" statute has been included in the 2018-19 budgets so no teacher gets a pay cut. In addition, teachers with up to four years were the only ones to get a base salary increase in the 2015-16 academic year. They were paid $33,000 in 2014-15, and then paid $35,000 in 2015-16. In the following years, first-year teachers did not see an increase to their base salary. It stayed at $35,000. How fast did teacher pay increase? North Carolina was ranked second in having the fastest teacher pay raise in 2016-17 nationally, according to the National Education Association. This is where Lee’s legislative assistant, Emily Barnes, says Lee got his information. However, that hasn’t always been the case. In the 2013-14 academic year, North Carolina was ranked 48th for percentage change in average teacher salary, with a -1.6 percent change. The state also ranked 41st in the 2015-16 academic year for teacher pay raises with a 0.3 percent change. North Carolina did rank first in teacher pay raise in 2014-15 with a 6.3 percent change from the previous year. Our ruling Teachers did get a salary increase in each of the past five years under Republican leadership. However, despite the "Held Harmless" statute, teachers who reach 25 years of experience or more today would not make as much as they would have in 2013-14. That’s the main wrinkle in Lee’s claim. North Carolina ranked second in fastest-rising teacher pay in 2016-17, though the ranking wasn’t consistent over the years. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-12411	Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich "apparently was assassinated at 4 in the morning, having given WikiLeaks something like 53,000 emails and 17,000 attachments. ... It turns out, it wasn’t the Russians."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/may/23/newt-gingrich/claim-slain-dnc-staffer-seth-rich-gave-emails-wiki/	It’s been several months since the intelligence community concluded Russia tampered in the election, including stealing Democratic Party emails and giving them to WikiLeaks. Yet an unfounded conspiracy theory persists: that WikiLeaks actually got the emails from a Democratic National Committee staffer who was shot and killed in July 2016. Seth Rich, who worked on voter access projects for the DNC, was 27 when he was killed early in the morning near his Washington home. Ten months later, the case remains unsolved, though Washington police have said they believe it was likely a botched robbery. WikiLeaks published tens of thousands of internal DNC emails several days after Rich died, leading conspiracy theorists to speculate that the two events were related. WikiLeaks offered a $20,000 reward for information about Rich’s murder. The story is back in the news because on May 15, a private investigator looking into Rich’s case said he had evidence to prove the theorists right. But the investigator, a man named Rod Wheeler, backtracked on his claims the next day, and the Rich family has sent him a cease-and-desist letter, saying their son was not WikiLeaks’ source. Even so, some right-wing pundits continue to peddle this conspiracy, most prominently on Fox News. Among them are host Sean Hannity and former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich. "We have this very strange story now of this young man who worked for the Democratic National Committee, who apparently was assassinated at 4 in the morning, having given WikiLeaks something like 53,000 emails and 17,000 attachments," Gingrich said on Fox May 21. "Nobody’s investigating that, and what does that tell you about what was going on? Because it turns out, it wasn’t the Russians." Contrary to Gingrich’s statement, the thin case that Rich was the DNC leaker is in no way substantial enough to outweigh ample evidence that Russia was the culprit. Two days after Gingrich made this claim, Fox News retracted its report promoting this conspiracy theory. Scant evidence that Seth Rich leaked the emails The latest iteration of this story started when Wheeler spoke to a reporter with Washington local news station WWTG-TV on May 15. Wheeler worked for the Washington police in the 1990s and is an occasional Fox News contributor. Texas businessman Ed Butowsky, another Fox News contributor, is financing Wheeler’s investigation. Wheeler told WWTG-TV he believes the local police and the FBI are engaged in a cover-up because of information found on Rich’s laptop and the relationship between the Washington mayor’s office and the DNC. "But you have sources at the FBI saying there is information that could link Seth Rich to WikiLeaks?" asked the WTTG-TV reporter. "Absolutely," Wheeler replied. "Yeah, and that’s confirmed." The next day, a national Fox News report said an unnamed federal investigator corroborated Wheeler’s findings. And according to the federal investigator, an FBI analysis of Rich’s laptop found that Rich made contact with a WikiLeaks director and sent him 44,053 emails and 17,761 attachments from DNC leaders. Here’s the problem: Hours after Fox published its report, Wheeler recanted. He told CNN that he hadn’t seen the evidence himself, and his knowledge of Rich’s alleged email contact with WikiLeaks came from the national Fox News reporter, not his own investigative work. "Let me just really quickly say this," Wheeler said on Hannity’s show May 16. "I don't know for sure, I don't know as a matter of fact if the emails went out to the WikiLeaks or anybody else, but it sure appears that way." Fox retracted its own May 16 article, saying "the article was not initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our reporting." So this allegation that Rich was the real DNC leaker — and related insinuation that Rich was murdered because of it — rests nearly entirely on claims from a single unnamed federal investigator with unspecified connections to the case. The theory also doesn’t make much logical sense. No evidence has emerged that shows Rich was so disgruntled with the DNC that he felt the need to expose its leaders to WikiLeaks. Further, the leaked emails were overall rather mild. They were embarrassing and prompted Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz of Florida to step down from her role as DNC chair, but they didn’t expose any conspiracies or illegal activity. All of this together makes for a pretty flimsy case, especially when compared to the broad consensus that Russian actors were the true culprit. Lots of evidence Russia stole, then leaked, the emails The intelligence community and private cybersecurity professionals have widely concluded that the DNC hack and WikiLeaks dump are covered in Russian fingerprints. The technical methods behind the hack were similar to those used by two Russian intelligence groups, dubbed APT28 and APT29, also known as Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear. And experts have said that dumping large quantities of stolen political information is a signature move of Russian influence operations. There’s also the fact that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and the Russian government have a well-documented relationship. Assange has hosted a television show on RT, a state-owned network, for example. Various intelligence agencies reiterated Russia’s culpability in official reports in October, December and January. And intelligence community leaders and experts in Russia and cybersecurity have said they agreed with this conclusion in testimony before Congress in the months since. "The final piece of Russia's modern Active Measures surfaced in the summer of 2016 as hacked materials were strategically leaked," said Clint Watts, senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute and former FBI special agent, in a March 30 Senate hearing. "The disclosures of WikiLeaks, Guccifer 2.0 and DC Leaks demonstrated how hacks would power the influence system Russia had built so successfully in the previous two years." There’s evidence that Russia engaged in cyber operations against Republicans, too, though it wasn’t as robust as the DNC hack. "The Russians used cyber operations against both political parties, including hacking into servers used by the Democratic National Committee and releasing stolen data to WikiLeaks and other media outlets," said former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper in a May hearing. "Russia also collected on certain Republican Party-affiliated targets, but did not release any Republican-related data." Our ruling Gingrich said DNC staffer Seth Rich "apparently was assassinated at 4 in the morning, having given WikiLeaks something like 53,000 emails and 17,000 attachments. ... It turns out, it wasn’t the Russians." There is no trustworthy evidence supporting the theory that Rich was WikiLeaks’ source for thousands of DNC emails. The police believe his death was the result of a botched robbery, not a political assassination. The intelligence community and cybersecurity experts have reached a broad conclusion that all the available evidence points to Russia as the actual perpetrators — based on technical indicators and an understanding of how Russian influence operations work. Gingrich and others are talking about an unfounded conspiracy theory as if it's a matter of fact. It is far from it. We rate his claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-10382	We are "borrowing Saudi money for Saudi oil" with the result being "dependency and debt."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/20/john-mccain/pushing-the-envelope-to-link-debt-and-energy/	John McCain says we're borrowing money from foreign governments to buy oil. He's not too happy about this. ( Read our story on how other candidates make similar statements here .) "We are borrowing from foreign lenders to buy oil from foreign producers," he said in a Houston speech. "In the world's capital markets, often we are even borrowing Saudi money for Saudi oil. For them, the happy result is that they are both supplier and creditor to the most productive economy on earth. For us, the result is both dependency and debt. "Over time, in interest payments, we lose trillions of dollars that could have been better invested in American enterprises. And we lose value in the dollar itself, as our debt portfolio undermines confidence in the American economy." When McCain says "borrowing", he doesn't mean a literal loan from a foreign country's government. Rather, it's the investments that foreigners make -- through buying bonds, but also through investments in the private sector -- because they see America as a good place to invest their money and want to keep their wealth in dollars. Economists we talked to say McCain is right that collectively the United States as a whole spends more than it saves. "As a country, we borrow because American households save very little and the government runs large budget deficits. As a result, we have a saving deficit that can only be financed by borrowing from abroad," said Barry Bosworth, an economist with the Brookings Institute, a nonpartisan research group. We also import much more oil than we produce -- a lot more -- and that leads us to the second part of McCain's debt equation. But there's no direct line between borrowing money from the Saudis and buying their oil, said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, DC., who also blogs for the liberal magazine The American Prospect. "What McCain says about Saudi Arabia and oil would be equally true of any imported good from any country," Baker said. "China is also a huge buyer of dollars, so they are lending us the money to buy their clothes." Jerry Taylor, an economist with the libertarian Cato Institute, had the harshest assessment of McCain's comments. "All trade across borders implies some degree of 'dependency,' as John McCain seems to define the term. If 'dependency' is bad, then free trade is bad," Taylor wrote us via email. "Restricting investments to 'American enterprises' is to restrict profit opportunity." Bosworth says McCain is connecting problems -- low savings and dependence on costly foreign oil -- that are really separate issues. "I don't think that there is any link between oil prices causing the low saving of American households or the government's budget deficits," he said. "Both preceded the rise in oil prices. Some people will prefer a solution that increases energy supply and others will argue that it is time to reduce demand. I don't think the lack of saving will play much of a role." McCain is right in some of the larger themes he's expressing. The U.S. does borrow more than it saves, and we import large quantities of oil to satisfy our energy expenditures. But the two phenomena aren't causally related. The Saudis aren't running a company store, where we're required to borrow from them to buy the product. Rather, these are two issues taking on new relevance because of dramatic increases in oil prices. McCain isn't entirely wrong, but by his choice of words he gives the impression that the two dynamics are working together. For this reason, we find his statement Half True.

pomt-13681	"As usual, Hillary & the Dems are trying to rig the debates so 2 are up against major NFL games."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/01/donald-trump/donald-trumps-pants-fire-claim-clinton-democrats-r/	Did Democrats rig the presidential debate schedule so the highly anticipated faceoffs would run opposite major sporting events? Donald Trump seems to think so. "As usual, Hillary & the Dems are trying to rig the debates so 2 are up against major NFL games," he wrote in a July 29, 2016, tweet. "Same as last time w/ Bernie. Unacceptable!" He was referring to the the first two debates -- Sept. 26, when the Atlanta Falcons are set to play the New Orleans Saints on Monday Night Football, and Oct. 9, when the New York Giants are scheduled to play the Green Bay Packers on Sunday Night Football. Trump’s tweet underscores one of Trump’s recurring campaign themes -- that Hillary Clinton is "crooked," including playing with a stacked deck against her primary challenger, Bernie Sanders. Hard evidence to support the allegation of bad faith by the Democratic National Committee against Sanders in scheduling the primary debates is elusive, as we’ve noted. But what about the fall’s debate schedule, which includes three presidential and one vice presidential debate between Sept. 26 and Oct. 19? The short answer is that Trump is wrong: The national parties have no role in setting the dates for the general-election debates. They were actually determined by an independent, bipartisan organization, well in advance of when the parties’ nominees became clear this year. (Trump’s campaign didn’t respond to an inquiry.) The debate-setting process Unlike primary debates, which are set by the Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee in collaboration with media outlets, the four general-election debates are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. While presidential debates were held in 1960, 1976, 1980 and 1984, the current system emerged in 1987 with the creation of the commission. At the time, it was co-chaired by two party leaders, Democrat Paul Kirk and Republican Frank Fahrenkopf. Those two men left their party positions in 1989, and since then the commission has included both Democrats and Republicans, along with journalists and other prominent figures, while staying away from people holding the parties’ official leadership positions. Fahrenkopf remains a co-chair, with Mike McCurry, a spokesman for then-President Bill Clinton, co-chairing for the Democrats. Democrats on the commission include former Rep. Jane Harman of California, while the Republicans include former Sens. John Danforth of Missouri and Olympia Snowe of Maine and former Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana. The commission works hard to avoid any suggestion of bias, said Alan Schroeder, a Northeastern University journalism professor and author of Presidential Debates: Risky Business on the Campaign Trail. "The way to depoliticize is to do everything early -- the candidate-inclusion criteria, the dates and locations, the formats, " Schroeder said. In the case of the 2016 general election debates, Schroeder said in January 2015 the commission solicited bids from universities willing to host a debate, and announced the 16 applicants in April 2015. Most importantly for evaluating Trump’s tweet, the commission announced the dates and locations on Sept. 23, 2015. That’s almost 14 months before Election Day. Back then, the Republican field had 17 candidates and there was widespread skepticism that Trump could win the nomination. Clinton, for her part, was the frontrunner but facing a spirited challenge from Sanders. Equally important, the NFL schedule wasn’t set until April 14, 2016 -- about seven months after the commission announced the debate dates. It shouldn’t be a surprise that there would be a game on a Sunday or a Monday night -- the NFL has been playing football on Monday nights since 1970 and on Sunday nights since 1987. But it’s something of a game of triage when trying to avoid sporting events at that time of year. Besides professional football, debate planners typically have to contend with playoff baseball and Saturday college football. "In choosing the dates, the commission sits down with a calendar to look at network programming -- the Olympics, playoff games, religious holidays," Schroeder said. "It’s never a clear calendar -- there are always conflicts of some kind or another. So they pick the best days possible and days that would generate most viewership." The debate commission echoed this theme when it responded to Trump’s tweet with this statement: "The Commission on Presidential Debates started working more than 18 months ago to identify religious and federal holidays, baseball league playoff games, NFL games, and other events in order to select the best nights for the 2016 debates. It is impossible to avoid all sporting events, and there have been nights on which debates and games occurred in most election cycles. A debate has never been rescheduled as a result. "As a point of reference, in a four-year period, there are four general election debates (three presidential and one vice presidential) and approximately 1,000 NFL games. "The CPD selects the debate dates a year in advance in order for the television networks to have maximum lead time and predictability in scheduling these extremely important civic education forums. The CPD believes the dates for the 2016 debates will service the American public well." In 2012, the final presidential debate between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama was scheduled on a Monday night that happened to be opposite a professional football game between the Detroit Lions and the Chicago Bears, and Game 7 of the National League Championship Series between the San Francisco Giants and St. Louis Cardinals. And of course, for Americans torn between football and politics, there are more options today than ever, including DVR and online streaming. Put it all together, Schroeder said, and the "idea of anyone gaming that process is really inconceivable." Our ruling Trump said that Clinton and her party "are trying to rig the debates" so that NFL games drain away viewers. However, neither Clinton nor her party were involved in setting up the dates for the general-election debates, as they were during the primary debates. Instead, that task falls to a bipartisan commission that has no connection to either the campaigns or the parties. In fact, the debate dates were chosen seven months before the NFL schedule was even released, making scheduling conflicts almost unavoidable -- not the work of one campaign or party.

pomt-09448	"The Florida Legislature raised taxes and fees by almost $2 billion" in the 2009 session.	true	/florida/statements/2010/mar/08/charlie-justice/charlie-justice-says-legislature-raised-2-billion-/	Facing a staggering budget shortfall last year, Florida's Republican-dominated Legislature had to make some tough decisions. Lawmakers relied on $5 billion in federal stimulus money, trimmed Medicaid reimbursement rates and cut several hundred government jobs. They also raised taxes and fees, a move that didn't sit well with Sen. Charlie Justice, D-St. Petersburg, who is running for the congressional seat now held by Republican Rep. C.W. Bill Young. "The Florida Legislature raised taxes and fees by almost $2 billion" in the 2009 legislative session, Justice claimed in a press release. He said the new taxes fell disproportionately on the middle class and that lawmakers should end exemptions to the sales tax and corporate income tax that "cater to corporate special interests." Republicans say their goal was to maintain basic levels of service while still cutting government. (State spending has dropped more than $7 billion since 2006-07, largely because of plummeting tax collections.) "We were in kind of a unique situation last year," said Todd Reid, the staff director for House Majority Leader Adam Hasner. Reid said that Florida had to maintain previous levels of education and health care spending to qualify for stimulus funds. "We felt we had reduced about as much as we could at that point." Given the size of the budget shortfall and the state's high unemployment rate -- it was 11.8 percent in December -- lawmakers sought new revenue sources. But $2 billion in tax and fee hikes? From a Legislature dominated by Republicans? We wondered if that was right. According to the Office of Economic and Demographic Research, the number mostly checks out. The office, which crunches budget figures for the Legislature, published a handy spreadsheet that details all of the laws passed in 2009 that affected state revenue, either positively or negatively. They include: - $935 million from a $1-per-pack tax increase on cigarettes. - $797 million from sharp fee increases to get a driver's license or new car tags. - $304 million in higher business taxes to replenish Florida's bankrupt unemployment compensation trust fund. - $195 million from fee increases for filing various types of court motions. The bottom-line projection for the budget year that ends in June: A little more than $2.2 billion in new taxes and fees (in a total state budget of $66.5 billion). So Justice was actually a little low. Two caveats: On the first day of the 2010 legislative session, lawmakers voted to delay the increased unemployment compensation tax for two years. (The rate was scheduled to jump from $8 per employee for most businesses to more than $100.) Without that increase, the total in new taxes and fees drops below $2 billion. But even though they put off the tax increase, lawmakers still approved it in 2009. Also, it's worth noting the Legislature didn't increase taxes all by itself. Gov. Charlie Crist had veto power over every revenue increase and chose to strike only two small items from the budget. Still, Justice's comment about new taxes is generally correct. State economists confirm that lawmakers passed new taxes totaling more than $2 billion last session. Even though he was slightly low, Justice was close enough to earn a True.

pomt-13938	Says Russ Feingold’s "campaign is powered by small-dollar contributions like ours."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/jun/22/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-right-about-russ-feingolds-campaign/	U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont loves to boast about his independence from super PACs and billionaires, saying his campaign relies on the support of small donors. Recently, the Democratic presidential hopeful extended his small donor claim to Russ Feingold. Sanders sent out a news release May 26, 2016 that said he would be raising money for Feingold, a former U.S. senator who is aiming to unseat Republican incumbent Ron Johnson in a rematch of their 2010 contest. Sanders also sent an email to his national fundraising list. "We are going to have to elect candidates up and down the ballot who recognize that it is too late for establishment politics and economics," Sanders wrote. "Candidates like my friend, former U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold." Sanders continued: "Russ led the fight with me to make the Affordable Care Act much stronger in 2009. He voted against the USA PATRIOT Act and the war in Iraq. He authored and passed landmark campaign finance reform legislation and his campaign is powered by small-dollar contributions like ours." That last accolade caught our eyes. Sanders’s record-breaking level of small-contribution support has been well noted. We wondered if small donors were also "powering" Feingold’s campaign. Sanders’ backup Typically, small donors are considered those who give $200 or less over an election cycle. Having a lot of small-dollar contributions can indicate strong grassroots support and an effective online fundraising effort. When asked to back up the statement, Sanders’ team sent us to a news release issued by Feingold’s campaign in April 2016. At that time, the release said, 30,000 Wisconsinites had contributed to Feingold’s campaign with money coming in from each of the state’s 72 counties. The release also claimed 96 percent of all contributions in the first quarter were $100 or less. The problem for fact-checkers -- it cannot be independently verified. PolitiFact National explored the issue when presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said "our campaign depends on small donations for the majority of our support." Her team provided similar information, saying more than 50 percent of the money raised by the campaign came from "online grassroots donations," with 98 percent smaller than $250. Until an individual donor surpasses $200 in contributions, their funds are unitemized on campaign disclosure reports. So the number of donors who give less than $200 is unknown. Numbers reported to the Federal Elections Commission provided weak support for Clinton’s statement, PolitiFact National found. And small donors accounted for less than 20 percent of Clinton’s total donations, according to those figures. The claim was rated Mostly False. FEC numbers The Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan campaign finance research group, tracks money given to candidates from individuals and PACs, as well as those self-financing their campaigns and money contributed from other means. Sanders’ profile on the group’s web site reports that 99 percent of his campaign’s more than $200 million in funds has come from individual contributions (as opposed, for instance, to political action committees). Of that, 62 percent -- or more than $129 million -- was from contributions of $200 or less. The other part comes from large individual contributions of up to $2,700. So what about Sanders’ Wisconsin pal, Feingold? According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Feingold has raised more than $10 million in the race against Johnson. Like Sanders, an overwhelming amount of his funds, 93 percent, come from individual contributions. But, Feingold has received a larger share of donations from large donors than small ones. Feingold received 52 percent of his overall funds from people who gave more than $200. Another 41 percent came from small individual donors. He also received about $600,000 from PAC contributions. So, the majority of Sanders’ funding -- 62 percent -- comes from these small donors while 41 percent of Feingold’s funding came from small donors. The phrase "powered by," of course, is open to some interpretation. We took a look at candidates in other competitive Senate races across the country this election cycle. Most candidates received less than 20 percent of all campaign funds from small donors. Some approached 30 percent -- still far below the proportion of funds Feingold has raised from small donors. So, while Feingold is not above 50 percent -- and does not match Sanders’ level -- we feel like the claim is generally on target. It doesn’t factor into this claim, but as a point of reference, Johnson has raised just less than $12 million. Individuals donated about 80 percent of that money. He has gotten a far greater share of his contributions from big spenders -- those donating between $200 and $2,700 this election cycle. Just 15 percent of his funds come people who donate less than $200, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Our rating Sanders said in a fundraising letter that Feingold’s "campaign is powered by small-dollar contributions like ours." Both the presidential and congressional hopefuls have received the majority of their support from individual donors. While small donors have played a role in Feingold’s funding, they’re not as integral as Sanders’ small donors. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-05373	Crime rises in communities with casinos.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2012/may/09/georgia-family-council/linking-crime-casinos-not-always-safe-bet/	Developer Dan O’Leary is pushing a big idea that he says will bring scores of jobs and truckloads of money to Georgia. The state’s most powerful political leaders, however, don’t like his plan -- a casino-style entertainment complex with video lottery terminals that could be a source of lottery revenue for the state’s HOPE scholarship program. One group offered another reason to fight O’Leary’s plan that had the Truth-O-Meter spinning like a roulette wheel. The Georgia Family Council put together a fact sheet that said crime will increase if any form of casino-style gambling is allowed. PolitiFact Georgia thought it would be interesting to see if the council was gambling with the facts with its claim. O’Leary, part of a team that operates Underground Atlanta, wants to build the complex near the busy I-85 interchange at Jimmy Carter Boulevard in Gwinnett County. At one meeting last month, the Gwinnett-based council presented an argument why O’Leary’s plan is not a good idea. Some of the crime statistics included: "A city can expect its crime rate to increase by 8 percent within four to five years of introducing casinos." "After casinos opened in Atlantic City, the total number of crimes within a 30-mile radius increased 100 percent." Much of the research on crime and casinos was done slightly more than a decade ago when more states permitted casinos. Some experts say most of the reports are flawed. The council’s policy analyst, Toby Tatum, sent us several reports to back up the organization’s claim. Fleishman-Hillard, a public relations firm representing O’Leary, sent us information to support that side. PolitiFact Georgia took a look at their reports, and some research we found ourselves. It’s been generally believed that casinos result in more crime in the surrounding community, primarily because of concerns about organized crime. In the 1990s, experts said in one report that for each dollar in legalized gambling, there is a similar amount in illegal gambling. There have been occasional news reports of cases like gamblers committing insurance fraud to get more money to feed their addiction or stories of people embezzling money from their employer for gambling. A 2004 Department of Justice-sponsored study found pathological gamblers more likely to be arrested for such offenses as probation or parole violations, liquor law violations, trespassing and other public order offenses. There’s evidence that casinos may have an impact in less likely areas, such as driving under the influence. One Journal of Health Economics report found there is a higher percentage (9.2 percent) of DUI fatalities in counties with casinos. They are more likely to occur in rural counties, but less likely in urban areas. In 1999, a federal panel released what was considered the most comprehensive study on casinos in America in a quarter-century. The National Gambling Impact Study Commission wrote there is insufficient data to determine whether casinos cause more crime. "The problem is that although a great deal has been written on the subject, so much of the writing on all sides is bombast and blather that it is difficult to discern any strong facts," the report said. Still, the commission concluded: "Taken as a whole, the literature shows that communities with casinos are just as safe as communities that do not have casinos." One of the most widely discussed studies on the topic was released in 2001 and co-authored by University of Georgia associate economics professor David Mustard. The study found some crime could decline because more less-skilled workers get jobs working at casinos and that the casinos improve economically depressed locations. Conversely, it found crime may rise because casinos draw unsavory characters and some compulsive gamblers commit crime to get more money to gamble. The study covered all 3,165 U.S. counties from 1977-1996. The study concluded that casinos increased all crimes except murder. Most offenses showed that the impact of casinos on crime began about three years after a casino opened. Eight percent of property crime and 10 percent of violent crime in counties with casinos was due to the presence of a casino, the study found. More recent news accounts of crime and casinos offer support to both sides of the debate. The Press of Atlantic City reported in September that the violent crime rate there was highest among the top-ranked gaming markets in the U.S., according to an analysis of 2010 federal crime statistics. Police Department leaders in that city and some researchers note that the Atlantic City statistics do not consider that the crime rate is based on its population of 39,000, rather than the 29 million visitors the city sees each year. In February, The Associated Press examined crime rates in areas near two large Connecticut casinos opened in the 1990s: the Foxwoods Resort and Mohegan Sun. The news organization looked at crime rates for several years before they opened and afterward and reported crime dropped by double-digit percentages in the nearby municipalities compared to the years before the casinos opened — mirroring a drop in crime nationwide. Few gambling facilities, though, are similar to what O’Leary has in mind in Georgia. The most frequent comparison is Dover Downs, located in Delaware. Dover Downs is one of the few casinos with video lottery terminals, which resemble slot machines. Jim Hutchison, a former Dover mayor and retired Dover police chief, worried about crime and other unruly elements when the state approved casino gambling in the mid-1990s. "It's nice to say that after all the years they've been operating here in Delaware, specifically Dover Downs, all those concerns I had are truly unfounded," Hutchison, who has testified to Georgia lawmakers on behalf of Dover Downs, the city's biggest taxpayer, told the AJC in March. There is some research that shows crime does increase in communities with casinos. There are some reports, such as the AP investigation, that show a drop in crime in some communities with casinos. The anecdotal evidence from Hutchison suggests crime hasn’t increased since Dover Downs opened. To say the least, the evidence is mixed. Crime has gone down in some areas with casinos. It has increased in others. But there does appear to be some truth to the council’s claim, though it needs a lot of context to move the needle higher on the Truth-O-Meter. We rate the council’s claim as Half True.	None	Georgia Family Council	None	None	None	2012-05-09T06:00:00	2012-04-19	['None']
