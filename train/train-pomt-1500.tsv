pomt-05112	Says "TriMet's own analysis shows that YouthPass does not actually add to the transit agency's costs."	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2012/jun/27/sam-adams/does-trimet-itself-say-free-rides-high-school-stud/	The TriMet Board recently adopted a budget that does not include free transit passes for Portland high school students. This week, Portland Mayor Sam Adams shot back with a ginormous fee increase on TriMet benches and shelters so he can provide the free passes. The YouthPass program is a big deal to Adams, who says transit access is critical to keeping teenagers in school and connected. In a statement released Tuesday, the mayor argued that providing passes for roughly 13,000 Portland Public Schools high school students doesn’t add to the transit agency’s operating costs. "In fact, TriMet's own analysis shows that YouthPass does not actually add to the transit agency's costs. No new buses, MAX trips, additional routes or drivers are needed to accommodate YouthPass riders," he said. TriMet’s own analysis showed that? This we had to check. PolitiFact Oregon contacted Caryn Brooks, the mayor’s spokeswoman. She turned up an Oct. 25, 2011 memo from an ECONorthwest economist to Claire Potter, TriMet’s director of financial analysis. The memo, commissioned by TriMet, explains the economic impact to the transit agency should it provide the passes without state support. Some quick background: Portland Public Schools has long provided free transit passes for low-income students. The concept was expanded under Adams in fall 2009 to include all PPS students. The state of Oregon paid for most of the $3.4 million program through a business energy tax credit; Portland Public Schools paid $800,000 of that. The arrangement ended in December 2011, at which point the City of Portland, Portland Public Schools and TriMet cobbled a plan to keep it running through the school year. Here’s the part of the ECONorthwest report that the mayor highlights: "The provision of free passes to PPS students likely did not affect TriMet's operating costs in a significant way. Discontinuing the provision of free passes is unlikely to result in operating cost savings." In other words: The report states the agency saves no money if it stops providing free rides. Adams is correct about that. But the analysis also shows that TriMet loses out on a potential $1.9 million in fare money from students in 2012-13. And that’s based on a monthly pass price tag of $27, wrote TriMet spokeswoman Mary Fetsch in an email. The price is scheduled to increase to $30 a month in September. The "additional cost is not what TriMet is concerned about -- it is the foregone passenger revenue, in the range of $2 million," Fetsch said. She’s right that the analysis is about the potential hit to TriMet’s revenue stream. And Adams knows that, because he’s proposed an 8000 percent increase in shelter and bench fees to squeeze $2 million out of TriMet, which he would then use to reimburse TriMet for the cost of the student passes. The mayor’s statement is accurate. But we think it needs additional information. Providing free student passes will not add to TriMet’s operating costs in the form of more drivers or bus routes, but it will deprive the transit agency of revenue once provided by other public agencies. The statement is accurate but needs extra information. We rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Sam Adams	None	None	None	2012-06-27T17:55:27	2012-06-26	['None']
pomt-03330	"The U.S. Postal Service doesn’t run on your tax dollars. It’s funded solely by stamps and postage."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/jul/24/american-postal-workers-union/postal-service-claim-not-fully-target/	There’s been a lot of conversation lately about proposed cuts to the U.S. Postal Service, particularly the idea of ending Saturday delivery. PolitiFact Georgia reader Wallace Cooper said he was skeptical about a specific claim in a recent television ad about the taxpayer cost of delivering the mail and asked us to do some fact-checking. "Members of the American Postal Workers Union handle more than 165 billion letters and packages a year. That’s about 34 million pounds every day. Ever wonder what this costs you as a taxpayer? Millions? Tens of millions? Hundreds of millions?" a voice says in the 30-second ad. The answer: "Not a single cent." Deliveries are solely funded by stamps and postage, the voice says. The ad was put together by the American Postal Workers Union. The union writes on its website that the ad was created to combat "detrimental legislation." The Postal Service boasts that nothing will keep its mail carriers from their appointed rounds. We at PolitiFact Georgia share a similar intrepid ethic regarding getting to the bottom of a claim. So what did we find? The Postal Service says on the facts page of its website that it does not receive tax dollars for its operations, but some context is necessary here. First, let’s look at its current situation. Before 1971, the Postal Service received annual appropriations from the federal government. Since then, it has operated independently, with revenues generated through the sales of postage stamps and services. But Congress does give the Postal Service $100 million a year to compensate the agency for revenue loss by providing, at congressional direction, free mailing privileges to blind people and overseas voters, a congressional report noted. The $100 million is less than 1 percent of the Postal Service’s annual budget. In 2012, the Postal Service pulled in about $65 billion in revenue, it says on its website. That’s $10 billion less than what collected in 2008, the year the Great Recession took hold. By some reports, the Postal Service is losing $25 million a day. The volume of mail the Postal Service handles has declined by nearly 27 percent since 2008, as Americans rely more on email communications instead of letters. The Postal Service’s debt rose from nothing to $10.2 billion between federal fiscal years 2005 and 2009, according to a congressional report. The federal fiscal year begins Oct. 1 and concludes Sept. 30. Another congressional report found Postal Service operating costs may be the largest reason for its financial troubles. In 2006, Congress passed legislation requiring the Postal Service to pre-fund its future retirees’ health benefits at a cost of approximately $5.6 billion per year. The Postal Service has cut expenses through a hiring freeze, offering early retirement to longtime employees and closing some district offices. It’s also increased revenue in recent years through several increases in the price of a postage stamp. In 2009, the Postal Service began borrowing money from the U.S. Treasury Department to deal with its troubles. Some news accounts report the service reached its borrowing limit of $15 billion in September 2012. Sally Davidow, a spokeswoman for the union, said the Postal Service had to borrow the money to offset the health benefit changes. She argued that health benefits are not part of the Postal Service’s operating expenses. "(The Postal Service) is required to pay that money back," Davidow added. "Borrowing money is different than relying on taxpayers." Davidow argued in the union’s defense that the Postal Service has $46 billion in its retiree health benefits fund, but the federal government won’t let the agency borrow from it. The Postal Service wrote in a November 2012 press release that it had a record fiscal year deficit of nearly $16 billion. The agency attributed about 70 percent of that net loss to the health care requirement. To sum up, the American Postal Workers Union claimed in its television ad that the U.S. Postal Service doesn’t operate on taxpayer dollars and and it’s solely funded by stamps and postage. The Postal Service has borrowed money from the government in recent years, primarily it says, to cover the cost to pre-fund employee health benefits. The first part of the statement is on target. The second part, however, gets a return to sender. We rate this claim Half True.	None	American Postal Workers Union	None	None	None	2013-07-24T00:00:00	2013-07-08	['United_States']
pomt-02324	Says Sen. Mitch McConnell is "the No. 1 recipient of contributions from lobbyists this cycle."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/mar/27/alison-lundergan-grimes/does-mitch-mcconnell-receive-more-money-lobbyists-/	Republicans are hopeful they can win enough Senate seats in November to take control of the chamber, which puts Sen. Mitch McConnell in the driver’s seat to become majority leader next year. But first, the Kentucky Republican needs to get through a tough re-election campaign. Both Republican primary challenger Matt Bevin and Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, the presumptive Democratic nominee, have sought to paint McConnell as a Washington insider after three decades in the Senate. Along those lines, in an email to her supporters on March 17, 2014, Lundergan Grimes claimed that McConnell is "the No. 1 recipient of contributions from lobbyists this cycle." There’s going to be a lot of mudslinging in this race and a lot of claims about who is raising money from whom and where. We thought we would start by checking whether McConnell is getting more contributions from lobbyists than anyone in Congress. Campaigns and candidates use "lobbyists" like a dirty word, but you may be asking, "what exactly is a lobbyist?" Glad you asked. Lobbyists are people who are hired to persuade members of Congress on a particular issue. They are brought in by many different industries, from private companies like Microsoft or ExxonMobil, to associations representing local governments, to nonprofits focused on hot-button legislation. Some organizations have in-house lobbyists, and others hire large firms that lobby Congress on a variety of topics. We first checked in with the Lundergan Grimes campaign to see where they got their numbers. They linked us to a report by Open Secrets, a nonpartisan campaign finance watchdog website run by the Center for Responsive Politics. The report, titled "Sincere or Strategic, Lobbyists Give Big," looked at trends in donations from federally registered lobbyists. If a company or organization spends a certain amount of money lobbying Congress, they’re required to register with the federal government. Open Secrets checks this database against the campaign finance disclosure reports that candidates file. Open Secrets found that the 25 lobbyists who have contributed the most money to campaigns this cycle have already donated $1.9 million. Contributions are not party exclusive; five of those 25 gave strictly to Republicans, 11 gave to Democrats and a handful gave to both. Open Secrets also released a list of the members of Congress who have received the most donations from lobbyists during the campaign cycle (since the start of 2013). With $281,301 in contributions from lobbyists, McConnell topped the list, followed closely by House Speaker John Boehner at $278,380. McConnell has also received another $50,000 from family members of lobbyists. Here’s the top 10: Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) $281,301 Rep. John Boehner (R-Ohio) $278,380 Sen. Mark Pryor (D-Ark.) $221,450 Sen. Mark Udall (D-Colo.) $204,400 Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) $194,300 Sen. Mark Begich (D-Alaska) $160,300 Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) $129,433 Sen. Kay Hagan (D-N.C.) $123,733 Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) $121,750 Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) $121,486 As you can see, it’s a hodgepodge of Democrats and Republicans rounding out the list, but the two most powerful Republicans in Congress lead the way, by quite a bit. This list doesn’t count the Massachusetts special election race in 2013 to replace Secretary of State John Kerry, won by Democrat Ed Markey. Markey raised about $306,000 from lobbyists between that special election and his 2014 re-election race, so he technically leads the cycle. A spokeswoman for Open Secrets said that when Lundergan Grimes made her statement, the organization had not yet updated their website with Markey’s contributions. Markey's situation, though, is a quirky anomaly, because he was in the unusual position of running twice in one campaign cycle. McConnell isn’t just the top congressional recipient of donations from lobbyists. According to his Open Secrets profile, he has also received more money than any other lawmaker since 2013 from a number of industries. He’s No. 1 in campaign donations from people who work in the fields of — deep breath here — agriculture services, air transportation, auto dealers and manufacturers, building materials, business associations, coal mining, commercial banks, commercial TV and radio stations, electric utilities, food and beverage, food stores, general contractors, health services, home builders, insurance, medical devices and supplies, mining, mortgage bankers and brokers, pharmaceutical and health products, railroads, retirees, steel production and trucking. When he last ran for re-election in 2008, McConnell, who was minority leader at the time, topped the list in two industries, coal mining and tobacco. He was fourth in contributions from lobbyists. It’s worth noting that in 2010 when Majority Leader Harry Reid was up for re-election, he benefited most from lobbyist contributions as well. With $947,000 in donations from lobbyists, Reid received nearly $300,000 more from lobbyists than the next closest lawmaker. So it’s not uncommon for party leaders to receive significant financial backing during their re-election fights. For her part, Lundergan Grimes has received $54,699 from lobbyists, 51st among candidates running in 2014. Our ruling Lundergan Grimes said McConnell is "the No. 1 recipient of contributions from lobbyists this cycle." Based on the analysis from Open Secrets, McConnell tops the chart for 2014. That’s probably a perk of his party position more than anything. As noted, Speaker Boehner is right behind him and Reid was the No. 1 recipient during his 2010 campaign. But that doesn’t change the accuracy of the claim. We rate it True.	None	Alison Lundergan Grimes	None	None	None	2014-03-27T17:45:31	2014-03-27	['Mitch_McConnell']
pomt-03704	"Well over 90 percent of felony cases, all over the nation, are committed by defendants who grew up in father-absent households."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/apr/18/john-duncan/rep-john-duncan-jr-says-90-percent-felons-grew-fat/	A reader recently sent us a letter he received from his congressman, Rep. John Duncan Jr., R-Tenn., asking us to check a surprising claim. "Well over 90 percent of felony cases, all over the nation, are committed by defendants who grew up in father-absent households," Duncan wrote. Patrick Newton, a spokesman for Duncan, said the letter was based on the congressman's "knowledge obtained from nearly eight years as a criminal court judge dealing with mostly felony cases." The spokesman went on to say that on Duncan’s first day as a criminal court judge in Knoxville, Tenn., chief probation counselor Gary Tullock told him it was actually 98 percent, a figure Duncan lowered slightly in his letter. "Mr. Duncan then went on to preside over 10,000 cases in nearly eight years," the spokesman said. "In each case, he was given a report or information on the defendant’s background. Congressman Duncan says in well more than 90 percent of cases, the defendant was described as being from either a ‘fatherless home’ or a ‘broken home.’ He found Mr. Tullock’s comment to be true through his own experience as a judge, and he fully stands by his remark." We should point out, however, that Tullock’s claim is based on data roughly 35 years old, while Duncan’s observations from his tenure as a judge are now a quarter-century old. That is inconsistent with Duncan’s use of the present-tense "are committed" in the constituent letter. In addition, even if these numbers were true for Knoxville, the statistics wouldn’t reflect conditions "all over the nation," as Duncan said in the letter. And of course, PolitiFact always prefers to deal in hard data. So we took a look at the available research. The few studies that address this question aren’t a perfect match to Duncan’s wording, because the data we have often addresses individuals who are in jail or prison, rather than people who are facing a "felony case." Still, the data is close enough for us to make an educated assessment. First, we looked at data from the Survey of Inmates in Local Jails, a sample of 7,000 inmates by the U.S. Justice Department. In 1996, almost 40 percent of the sampled inmates had lived with both parents, with just over 60 percent of inmates saying they grew up with only one parent, with grandparents or in another arrangement. The numbers were similar in 2002 -- 44 percent growing up with both parents and 56 percent growing up in other situations. These numbers suggest that there’s a strong link between growing up in a non-two-parent household and becoming an inmate, but at rates well below the 90 percent Duncan cited. Second, we looked at data from the Justice Department’s Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional Facilities. The 2004 survey asked inmates who were parents themselves about what kind of family arrangements they had while while growing up. In state prisons, 43 percent of the inmates said they grew up with both parents, while 57 percent said they grew up in other arrangements. The data was similar for federal prisons -- 45 percent with both parents and 55 percent in other arrangements. Once again, this suggests rates lower than 90 percent Finally, we looked at a study co-authored by Cynthia C. Harper of the University of California at San Francisco and Sara McLanahan, a professor at Princeton University’s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs who has authored a wide range of studies about disadvantaged Americans. They found that once you control for other factors, such as family income, a child growing up in a mother-only household was almost twice as likely as a child growing up in a mother-father household to end up incarcerated. That would put the percentage somewhere around 60 percent, which is broadly in line with the other studies. Sixty percent is a significant number, but it is not as great as the 90 percent figure Duncan cited. When we contacted McLanahan, she said she was skeptical that the 90 percent figure was accurate. "I cannot think of any data that would give this information," she said. Dewey Cornell, a clinical psychologist and professor of education at the University of Virginia, said that even if Duncan’s statistic were true, "it would be misleading and incomplete," because it does not address how many people grew up in father-absent households and did not commit felonies. "We could point out that 99 percent of felony offenders drank milk as a child, too, but it is easy to see the fallacy here because we have no preconceptions about milk the way we do about father absence," he said. "Father absence is surely an important concern, but it is only one of a number of risk factors for felony criminal behavior." Our ruling The data we found supports Duncan’s impression that growing up in a fatherless home is one of the factors that contributes to eventual incarceration. But the quantitative research does not show the near-certain link between felonies and fatherlessness that Duncan portrays. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-14363	"According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 120 Americans on average die from a drug overdose every day. Overall, drug overdose deaths now outnumber deaths from firearms."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/21/joe-pitts/rep-joe-pitts-says-120-americans-die-daily-overdos/	In a recent Medium post, Rep. Joe Pitts, R-Pa., lamented the toll of addiction in his state and across the country. "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 120 Americans on average die from a drug overdose every day," Pitts wrote. "Overall, drug overdose deaths now outnumber deaths from firearms." We wondered whether those numbers were accurate, so we took a closer look. The CDC calculates overdose deaths from prescription drugs separately from overdose deaths from illicit drugs. To get the full number, you have to add both categories together. In 2014, there were 25,760 deaths from prescription-drug overdoses. That same year, there were 17,465 deaths from illicit drugs, including heroin and cocaine. The agency does not track overdoses from every illicit drug, so this accounting may understate the full number. Still, it provides a baseline. And if you add together the overdose deaths from prescription and illicit drugs, the sum is 43,225 overdose deaths. Then, if you divide that by 365 days, it works out to more than 118 overdose deaths a day, or just shy of the 120-per-day figure that Pitts cited. That’s close enough for us. We should note that the category of total overdoses includes accidental deaths, homicides, suicides and deaths of undetermined intent. So how do the number of deaths from drug overdoses compare with the number of deaths from firearms? According to CDC, there were 33,599 deaths caused by firearms in 2014. That includes homicides, suicides, legal interventions, accidents and cases of undetermined intentions. So in 2014, there were indeed more overdose deaths (43,225) than there were deaths from firearms (33,599), making Pitts’ second claim correct. Our ruling Pitts said that "according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 120 Americans on average die from a drug overdose every day. Overall, drug overdose deaths now outnumber deaths from firearms." Pitts is very close on the first part, and he’s correct on the second. So we rate his statement True.

pomt-14919	"We have record numbers of people living in poverty."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/01/carly-fiorina/fiorina-defends-her-gop-debate-remarks-claims-us-h/	Carly Fiorina said on Fox News Sunday that she "misspoke" when she used a striking but inaccurate statistic about women and unemployment during the third GOP debate. Nonetheless, Fiorina suggested the real culprit is the "liberal media." Numerous fact-checkers, including PolitiFact, debunked Fiorina’s claim that "92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama’s first term belonged to women." To FIorina, that’s quibbling with details to bury the larger truths. "This is what the liberal media tries to do. Let us discredit the messenger so that we ignore the truth of the message," she said Nov. 1. "Here’s the truth of the message: Women are harmed by this administration’s policies. Record numbers of women have lost jobs, are living in poverty, or are living in extreme poverty." Progressive policies, Fiorina continued, have been bad for everyone, regardless of gender: "We have record numbers of people who are no longer working or who have quit looking for work. We have record numbers of people on food stamps. We have record numbers of people living in poverty. Those are the facts. That is the truth." We wanted to check out her claim that there are more people living in poverty now than ever before. What the numbers say Looking at data from the Census Bureau, Fiorina’s right that the number of people living in poverty (46.7 million in 2014) is the highest since the census began keeping track in 1959. However, the poverty rate — the measure typically used — is nowhere near historical highs. There are 8 more million people living in poverty now than in 1959, but the overall population of the United States also grew by 141 million people (from 177 million in 1959 to 318 million in 2014). So the poverty rate actually decreased from 22.4 percent in 1959 to 14.8 percent in 2014. "Most economists would agree that standards of living have increased substantially since 1959, and poverty, especially elderly poverty, was more severe in 1959 than today," said John Iceland, a professor of sociology and demography at Pennsylvania State University and author of Poverty in America. Here’s a graph from a Census Bureau report published in September of 2015 that illustrates this point: All the experts we spoke to cautioned against using raw numbers when making comparisons. Instead, analysts typically use rates to correct for the growing population of the nation. "If we use absolute values and not rates, then the following statements are both true: There are more people who are poor than ever today. But GDP is much higher today than it ever was under a Republican president, so the Obama Administration economic policy is a smashing success," said Sheldon Danziger, the president of the nonpartisan Russell Sage Foundation, which funds research on poverty. If we use Fiorina’s preferred measure, we reached a record number of people living in poverty under the watch of every president starting with Richard Nixon, Danziger pointed out. Conversely, said George Washington University economist Tara Sinclair, the number of people not living in poverty has also increased. "No president in the last 40 years has been able to lower the number of people in poverty. Poverty rates fell most under the Bill Clinton Administration than any since Nixon," Danziger said. What’s more, given the economic impact of the recession, poverty is actually lower than expected, in part due to spending in the stimulus package, according to Austin Nichols, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan economic and social policy think tank. "So if Obama had any effect on poverty, it was to lower poverty, though presidents tend to have smaller impacts on broad economic trends than they would like to believe," he said. "In fact, when you use a broader definition of poverty that encompasses noncash aid, poverty hardly changed through the recession, which was a surprise to many who work on these issues." As for Fiorina’s claim that "record numbers of women ...are living in poverty," she’s again accurate that more women live in poverty today than ever (about 162,000 in 2014). But the overall rate has remained relatively unchanged. Here’s a chart using census data that illustrates that point: A Fiorina spokeswoman passed along two articles highlighting the increase in raw numbers and told PolitiFact that the increase should not be trivialized. Our ruling Fiorina said, "We have record numbers of people living in poverty today." In terms of raw numbers, Fiorina is correct that more people live in poverty today than ever in the 56 years the census has been keeping track. However, absolute value is an inappropriate measure for poverty analysis, experts said. If we use the right measure, poverty rate, we see that poverty has decreased significantly since 1959. We rate Fiorina’s claim Half True.	None	Carly Fiorina	None	None	None	2015-11-01T15:56:09	2015-11-01	['None']
pomt-11596	"America is a nation of builders. We built the Empire State Building in just one year. Isn’t it a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a minor permit approved for the building of a simple road?"	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/30/donald-trump/does-it-take-10-years-get-permit-build-road-donald/	President Donald Trump in his State of the Union address repeated a long-standing complaint about how excessive bureaucratic red tape holds up the construction of federal projects. In championing a regulatory rollback, Trump noted that the regulatory burden has grown heavier with time. "America is a nation of builders. We built the Empire State Building in just one year," he said. "Isn’t it a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a minor permit approved for the building of a simple road?" We decided to look at how long it took to build the Empire State building, and the length of the current permitting process. How long did it take to build the Empire State Building? A historical timeline from the Empire State Realty Trust states that construction began on March 17, 1930. The building was finished one year and 45 days later. So Trump is close in terms of the year-long timeline of construction he gave. However, we were unable to find how long the permitting process took, and the Empire State Realty Trust doesn’t offer any clues. It notes only that several parties formed Empire State, Inc. in 1929, and name Alfred E. Smith, a former governor of New York, to head the corporation. It’s unclear whether or when they applied for a permit. Can it take 10 years to get a permit approved? According to the lead infrastructure aide on the White House’s Council on Environmental Quality, the permitting process for how the government builds roads, bridges, rails and pipelines is now an average of under five years. The Wall Street Journal quoted Alexander Herrgott telling a Washington conference in January that he hopes the administration will "take permit delivery times from what is now an average of 4.7 years down to two years." That 4.7 year figure also appeared in a 2015 study by the law firm Arnold & Porter into the government permitting process. The firm found that the average length of an infrastructure project — from the beginning with a governmental environmental study until its completion — spanned 4.7 years. A 2014 Government Accountability Office study, citing third-party estimates, put the average at 4.6 years. However, a study commissioned by the Treasury Department under President Barack Obama found the average time to complete an environmental review was longer than 4.7 years in 2015 — and that duration has grown through recent decades. It cited studies conducted for the Federal Highway Administration, which found the time increased from 2.2 years in the 1970s, to 4.4 years in the 1980s, to 5.1 years in the 1995 to 2001 period, to 6.6 years in 2011. Yet another study, by a pro-deregulation group called Common Good, says infrastructure often takes 10 years to be approved. But according to the Wall Street Journal, "Outside experts say actual review times vary widely based on the scope of a project and other environmental factors." Among the timeframes described in various studies, Trump is picking the high end. It bears repeating that his own White House aide to the Council on Environmental Quality said the average was 4.7 years. The White House also did not provide an example of a "minor permit" for a "simple road" taking 10 years. Our ruling Trump said, "America is a nation of builders. We built the Empire State Building in just one year. Isn’t it a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a minor permit approved for a simple road?" The Empire State Building was constructed in one year and 45 days — which means that part of Trump’s claim was pretty close. Recent government studies say the permit approval time ranges from 4.6 to 6.6 years. The only study we found that claims a 10-year approval is common comes from a pro-deregulation group, which raises questions about its reliability. We rate this Half True.

pomt-00955	The current debate over authorizing military action against the Islamic State "would be the first time Congress would place limits on the commander-in-chief's ability to be commander-in-chief."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/feb/19/adam-kinzinger/republican-lawmaker-claims-congress-has-never-set-/	Months after the Islamic State emerged as a threat in the Middle East, President Barack Obama has asked Congress for authorization to use military force against the radical Islamist group. An administration proposal now before Congress would limit the use of force to three years. The legislation also says it is not authorizing the use of "armed forces in enduring offensive ground operations." In something of an odd-bedfellows pairing, some hawkish Republicans prefer giving the president even wider leeway to go after the Islamic State, sometimes called ISIS or ISIL. Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., is among those who say Congress should ease restrictions from the proposal, known as an authorization for the use of military force. "This would be the first time Congress would place limits on the commander-in-chief's ability to be commander-in-chief," Kinzinger said on the Feb. 15, 2015, edition of ABC’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos. "We don't own his limited strategy. The president has to make that decision, which is why I think he needs the broad power to do what the commander-in-chief does." Republicans wanting to give Obama more power? That caught us by surprise. So we took a closer look at Kinzinger’s statement. Congress, the presidency and war: A brief history Military historians we spoke with took umbrage with Kinzinger’s statement, noting a longstanding tension between the legislative and the executive branches over military powers. In fact, the conflict goes back as far as the Founding Fathers. In the Constitution, Congress was granted the power to declare war and raise and maintain an army and a navy. At the same time, the president was deemed commander-in-chief. Those two roles have competed for centuries. The issue prompted a 1800 Supreme Court case, Bas vs. Tingy, in which the court distinguished between a declared war — a status that the court ruled grants sweeping powers to the president — and military action authorized by other legislative methods. Essentially, the decision said that "in a declared war, the president's actions are unrestricted, except as restricted by the laws of war," said Anthony Arend, professor of government and foreign service at Georgetown University. By contrast, "in a war declared by other statutory means, Congress can set limits." The last time Congress declared war was World War II. Since then, military operations have been conducted through authorizations for the use of military force (and, in some instances, without congressional approval). Congress used those opportunities to impose limits on how the president could use force. For example, the 1983 resolution that provided authority for President Ronald Reagan to send American troops to participate in a multinational peacekeeping force in Lebanon set a time limit of 18 months. Then, in 1991, Congress authorized the use military force to oust Iraqi forces from Kuwait. But the agreement stipulated that President George H.W. Bush first had to show congressional leaders that he had used "all appropriate diplomatic and other peaceful means to obtain compliance by Iraq with the United Nations Security Council." And congressional intervention into the president’s powers as commander-in-chief doesn’t begin or end with authorizations. Other types of legislation have played a role as well. In the 1930s, the Neutrality Acts limited President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s ability to aid allied nations fighting in World War II. In 1973, Congress passed a law to block any future military operations Southeast Asia unless Congress approved them, essentially ending the United States’ engagement in the Vietnam War. Later, Congress rebuked President Gerald Ford’s request for military aid to Vietnam. The most significant and lasting Vietnam-era congressional response came in 1973, when Congress overrode President Richard Nixon’s veto of the War Powers Resolution. The act required presidents to notify Congress within 48 hours of sending troops into harm's way and mandated authorization from Congress if military force is to be used beyond 60 days. The Supreme Court has never weighed in on the constitutionality of the War Powers Resolution, but every president since it passed "has taken the position that it is an unconstitutional infringement by Congress on the president’s authority as commander in chief," the Congressional Research Service has written. Despite this, presidents have tended to abide by key aspects of the law for pragmatic reasons, hoping to appease Congress and present a united front before utilizing military force. Finally, Congress can use (and has used) the power of the purse to restrict the president’s use of military force. For example, in 1993, Congress prohibited funding for a continuous presence of U.S. forces in Somalia. Kinzinger’s response When we took this to Kinzinger’s office, spokeswoman Catherine Gatewood said the congressman "was talking in the context of fighting terrorism and radical jihadism. In the current war, Congress has never taken a position to limit the president’s ability to fight terrorism, so to do so in his fight against ISIS would be a change in policy." The far more general nature of the statement suggests to us that this is an after-the-fact reinterpretation of his words. But even if we take it at face value, it’s not clear to us that Kinzinger is accurate. He has a point that the 2001 joint resolution that authorized the use of force against al-Qaida was quite broad. In fact, it didn’t even name al-Qaida as the target, but rather gave the president the power to use force against "nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on Sept. 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons." That’s pretty open-ended. Still, even that resolution restricted the efforts to terrorist groups or countries directly or tangentially involved in the planning and execution of the 9/11 attacks. This limitation has at least forced debates on whether Obama needs authorization to continue military action in Syria against the Islamic State. "It is a bit of a stretch to say (the 2001 authorization) covered ISIS, but you could make a case for that," said Richard Stoll, an expert on international conflict at Rice University. "It is better if we’re going to use military force to say, ‘I, as president, may have the power to do this, but it is better if Congress approves it, because it tells the world we stand together.’ " And it is not as though Congress has been absent from the debate on anti-terrorism strategy. For example, President George W. Bush in 2006 signed legislation passed by Congress to outlaw use of torture against terrorism suspects who were sent to Guantanamo Bay. "A lot of the action, when you think about congressional checks on war powers, happens behind closed doors," said William Howell, an American politics professor at the University of Chicago and author of While Dangers Gather: Congressional Checks on Presidential War Powers. "There are things Obama and Bush might very well like to do that neither of them followed up on, assuming Congress would intervene and make life difficult for them. When you think about Congress as a player on debates on war, it’s not just resolutions and legislation; a lot of this stuff is anticipatory." Our ruling Kinzinger said that the authorization for use of military force now pending in Congress would represent "the first time Congress would place limits on the commander-in-chief's ability to be commander-in-chief." A plain reading of that statement finds it problematic. Time and time again, Congress has intervened to rein in presidents from taking certain types of actions or continuing combat longer than lawmakers want. To do this, Congress simply has to use the power it is granted in the Constitution, authority that has been affirmed and reaffirmed by courts for centuries. Even the narrower interpretation of the statement that Kinzinger’s office stands by — that it only refers to the war on terrorism — doesn’t hold up. We rate the statement False.

pomt-03942	"There are more people killed with baseball bats and hammers than are killed with guns."	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2013/feb/20/paul-broun/congressman-uses-wrong-words-gun-claim/	Some gun control critics are using a similar talking point in the national debate over this issue. PolitiFact Georgia spotted two recent claims on the topic that show the importance of being precise when making an argument on an issue. One speaker got it right. The other person made a more general statement on guns and got it wrong. Our odyssey began when an interesting comment by a state senator started making the rounds at the Georgia Capitol and on Twitter. "There's more murders with hammers last year than...shotguns and pistols and AK-47s," said state Sen. Bill Jackson, a Republican from Appling. Two days after Jackson’s statement, U.S. Rep. Paul Broun, a Republican from Athens, was quoted by Slate.com on the same topic. "There are more people killed with baseball bats and hammers than are killed with guns," said Broun, who believes in limited government and is running for the U.S. Senate in 2014. We quickly discovered our partners at other PolitiFact operations have examined similar claims before. Here’s what they found: In January, some Facebook posts began to circulate that were critical of the White House’s proposal to restrict the availability of some weapons. "Facts gun control advocates don’t want you to know. According to the FBI, in 2011, 1,694 were murdered with knives, 726 with hands or feet, 496 with clubs or hammers, 323 with rifles of any type. But Obama wants to ban semi-automatic rifles?" it read. The FBI figures also showed that 356 people were killed with shotguns. PolitiFact reviewed 2011 FBI data on the types of weapons used to commit murders. The numbers posted on Facebook nearly matched the FBI data. The Facebook post of how many people were killed with hands or feet was two below the FBI total of 728. A few weeks later, our partners at PolitiFact Texas examined a similar claim from that state’s attorney general, Greg Abbott. "FBI: More people killed with hammers & clubs each year than rifles," Abbott said in a Twitter post. He supplied a link to a Jan. 3, 2013, Fox News commentary piece that originated on the conservative website Breitbart.com and referred to FBI murder statistics from 2005 through 2011. PolitiFact Texas noted Abbott used selective data to base his claim. That said, PolitiFact Texas noted, it is correct that FBI data indicates that in 2011, more people were killed with "clubs and hammers" than with any type of rifle. They rated his claim True. Our efforts to reach Broun were unsuccessful. Broun’s statement is not as specific as Jackson, whose claim we rated True, and the others. FBI data shows that 6,220 Americans were murdered by handguns in 2011. That’s more than 12 times the number of people killed with clubs or hammers, not including how many people were killed by other types of guns. Broun’s claim that there are more people killed with baseball bats and hammers than are killed with guns was less specific. Broun’s general use of "guns" by its nature includes handguns. That makes his statement way off. FBI statistics show that 8,583 people were killed with all guns in 2011 -- most of them (6,220) with handguns. Broun is a congressman who has inserted himself directly into the heated gun debate. And he’s now running for the U.S. Senate. His high-profile run for higher office means that more of his statements will end up in the glare of the spotlight. And some of them could combust. Our rating for Broun: Pants on Fire.

pomt-09019	"Florida’s high school graduation rate falls well below the national average."	true	/florida/statements/2010/jul/08/alex-sink/alex-sink-says-floridas-grad-rates-are-low/	Like any good Democrat, gubernatorial hopeful Alex Sink has a habit of highlighting the state's mediocre public education record. Voters need look no further than her campaign website, where she laments student achievement records. "Florida’s high school graduation rate falls well below the national average," reads her campaign website. "That’s unacceptable, especially as we work to build a new and stronger Florida economy." The campaign did not respond to a request for Sink's source, but we found plenty of information that shows Florida is far from the head of the class when it comes to graduation rates. The National Center for Education Statistics puts the national average graduation rate at 73.9 percent based on the class of 2006-2007 in a 2010 report. It determined Florida, with a rate of 65 percent, was among 11 states and the District of Columbia with graduation rates below 70 percent. In fact, Florida fell below the national average every year from 2001 to 2007. The report only counted traditional diplomas. Diplomas Count 2010, another respected education report, also puts Florida's graduation rate below the national average for every school year from 2005 through 2007, the most recent years available. For example, the graduation rate for Florida's class of 2007 was 62.1 percent. The national rate was 68.8 percent. Only nine other states and the District of Columbia also scored below 65 percent. Diplomas Count reached its results counting only students receiving standard high school diplomas. Recipients of General Educational Development diplomas, certificates of attendance and other nondiploma credentials were treated as nongraduates. We found only one source that somewhat countered Sink's claim, and it's an interesting one -- the Florida Department of Education. Spokesman Cheryl Etters said national reports are not the most credible source of information because each ranking and state may use different "graduate" definitions. For example, Florida counts students who obtain a GED in two of its graduation counts. But Diplomas Count 2010 and other education research groups do not. In all, the state calculates three graduation rates: The regular rate counts all diploma recipients as graduates, including standard and special diplomas and all GEDs. For the 2006-2007 school year the rate was 72.4. The No Child Left Behind graduation rate considers only standard diplomas and GEDs awarded to high school students. It excludes certificates of attendance and GEDs awarded to adult students. That rate was 69.8 in 2007. The National Governors Association rate counts standard diplomas and certificates of attendance, but not GEDs. That rate was 70.3 in 2007. We decided to compare these numbers to the national graduation rates we had for that school year, even though it wouldn't be an exact comparison. Florida's figures all fell below the National Center for Education Statistics 2007 national graduation rate of 73.9 percent, thus backing Sink's claim. Florida's numbers were higher than the national graduation rate of 68.8 percent published in Diplomas Count 2010, but that's most likely because Diplomas Count has a more narrow "graduate" definition. In short, multiple calculations determined Florida's graduation rate falls below the national average. As for the "well below," part of Sink's claim, both the National Center for Education Statistics and Diplomas Count put Florida among the bottom third of all the states. And, while Florida's most recent graduation rates show improvement -- during the 2008-2009 school year, the regular graduation rate rose to 78.6, the No Child Left Behind graduation rate rose to 76.2, and the National Governors Association rate climbed to 76.3 -- national groups have yet to evaluate the latest data, so we can't determine whether Florida has finally surpassed the average national graduation rate. Based on what we know and the latest data, we say Sink passed the test. We give this a True.	None	Alex Sink	None	None	None	2010-07-08T19:33:39	2010-07-08	['None']
pomt-07519	Said Planned Parenthood’s early objective was to "help kill black babies before they came into the world."	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2011/apr/08/herman-cain/cain-claims-planned-parenthood-founded-planned-gen/	This presidential election season, Georgia’s homegrown prospect Herman Cain is talking about race. Cain, a black, conservative Republican, recently said the media is "scared that a real black man may run against Barack Obama." And there’s this one about pro-abortion rights group Planned Parenthood: "When Margaret Sanger - check my history - started Planned Parenthood, the objective was to put these centers in primarily black communities so they could help kill black babies before they came into the world," Cain said during a talk in Washington, D.C., at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative group. "It's planned genocide," Cain added. He wants the U.S. Congress to yank funding for Planned Parenthood, which receives about $75 million a year to provide non-abortion health services. Was Planned Parenthood founded to help kill unborn black babies? Cain asked his audience to check his history. So, we did. First, a disclaimer. Cain, who has launched a presidential exploratory committee, was a talk show host on AM 750 and now 95.5 FM WSB, which, like The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, is part of Cox Media Group. Cain has more political heft than your average talking head. The former CEO of Godfather Pizza beat a six-term U.S. congressman to finish second in Georgia’s 2004 U.S. Senate Republican primary. The Morehouse grad has eight honorary doctorate degrees and has authored four books, and he serves on several corporate boards. Now some history. Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger is credited with making birth control legal and widely available. Born 1879, Sanger, who was white, blamed her mother’s death on her frequent pregnancies. At the time, speaking about birth control could lead to arrest. She thought that if women could legally control the number of children they bore, their health and economic conditions would improve. We consulted with scholarship, Cain’s camp, anti-abortion groups, Sanger’s biographer, and multiple experts on Cain’s claim. The supposed evidence that Sanger supported black genocide is a loose collection of her most objectionable statements, her ties to the disgraced eugenics movement, and her work on what was called the Negro Project. That effort, started in 1939, brought birth control services (but not abortion) to black communities in the South. These facts don’t come close to supporting Cain’s claim. Eugenics was once a wildly popular theory that the human race can be improved through better breeding and genetics. It drew together backers as diverse as President Theodore Roosevelt and black intellectual W.E.B. DuBois. At its best, the U.S. movement pushed for better prenatal care. At its worst, it enabled forced sterilization laws and let claims that blacks and immigrants were inferior to masquerade as science. Sanger welcomed some of the movement’s more notorious leaders onto the board of a predecessor to Planned Parenthood. She also endorsed paying pensions to women of low intelligence who agreed to be sterilized. But we found no evidence that Sanger advocated - privately or publicly - for anything even resembling the "genocide" of blacks, or that she thought blacks are genetically inferior. Every academic PolitiFact Georgia consulted said that Cain’s claim is wrong. "I have never run into any serious academic reference of Sanger or others wanting to ‘kill black babies,’" Indiana University professor Ruth Engs, a eugenics movement expert, told PolitiFact Georgia in an e-mail. What’s worse, Cain got his facts mixed up. Sanger’s first birth control clinic opened in 1916 in the Brownsville neighborhood of Brooklyn, N.Y., which was mostly Irish and Jewish. When she did open a Harlem clinic in the early 1930s, about half of its patients were white. Members of the black establishment, including DuBois and black newspaper the Amsterdam News, supported it. This was hardly the pro-genocide camp. None of these centers performed abortions. Those who think Sanger wanted black genocide cite the Negro Project. But even their strongest evidence, a passage from a letter she wrote advocating that organizers recruit black ministers for the project, does not come close to proving a genocidal plot. Sanger wrote that "We don’t want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs." But her correspondence shows this sentence advocates for black doctors and ministers to play leadership roles in the Negro Project to avoid misunderstandings. Lynchings and Jim Crow laws gave blacks good reason to be wary of attempts to limit the number of children they bore. In Harlem, she hired a black doctor and social worker to quell those fears. The facts of the Negro Project suggest nothing more genocidal than a public health project. Black leaders DuBois and Mary McLeod Bethune, founder of the National Council of Negro Women, and the pastor of the influential black Abyssinian Baptist Church were members of its advisory council. First lady Eleanor Roosevelt was supportive. For Sanger to launch a genocidal plot behind their backs and leave no true evidence in her numerous writings would require powers just shy of witchcraft. Really, calling the Negro Project a genocidal plot defies common sense. Why would Sanger try to destroy a race of people by giving them access to the very thing she thought could make life better? Planned Parenthood’s early objective was not to "help kill black babies before they came into the world." Sanger failed to rise above the ethnic and racial paternalism of her time, but that’s a far cry from being genocidal. Cain’s claim is a ridiculous, cynical play of the race card.

pomt-10683	"Five percent of Americans pay over half the income taxes in this country. Forty percent of Americans pay no income taxes at all."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/13/fred-thompson/thompsons-tax-numbers-add-up/	Fred Thompson, in arguing that the tax cuts of the Bush administration should be renewed, said that 5 percent of Americans pay over half the income taxes in this country, and that 40 percent of Americans pay no income taxes at all. Both figures are true. The top 5 percent of all payers do pay more than half the income tax. They pay about 59.2 percent of all individual income tax, according to an analysis by the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan institute run jointly by the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution. Thompson also said that 40 percent of Americans pay no income tax. This claim is supported by the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan tax research group that promotes transparency in the tax code and economic growth. There's a small caveat to the 40 percent number — it includes nonfilers, typically taxpayers who don't have to file returns because their incomes are too low. It's logical to assume that most nonfilers don't pay income taxes, but it's possible that some did if they had income taxes withheld by an employer. This is probably a very small number, because people with low incomes have an economic incentive to file a return and get a refund. The U.S. income tax system is progressive, which means that rates increase as income increases. Given that structure, it makes sense that people with higher incomes pay more taxes, and people with low incomes might pay no tax at all. Thompson's numbers are on the money, and we rate them True.

pomt-00846	Says Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu "didn't change his position" on a two-state solution.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/mar/22/ron-dermer/israeli-ambassador-tells-us-audience-netanyahu-did/	Sunday shows fixed their spotlight on newly re-elected Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose campaign-season remarks shutting down a two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict inflamed tensions with the White House. Now Netanyahu and his delegates are saying the comments were misunderstood. The international uproar started when Netanyahu said a Palestinian state would not happen during his tenure if he won re-election to a fourth term, which widely sounded like a departure from his previously stated support for a two-state solution. After Netanyahu’s Likud Party won enough seats to maintain coalition control of the government, Netanyahu tried to temper his position in interviews with American journalists, but President Barack Obama said he is taking Netanyahu "at his word" when Netanyahu said a two-state solution "wouldn’t happen during his prime ministership." Israel’s ambassador to the United States, Ron Dermer, appeared on NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday to defend the Israeli leader. Host Chuck Todd asked, "So the president is wrong that he takes the prime minister at his word at what he said before the election?" "He didn't say what the president and others seem to suggest that he's saying," Dermer said. "And he was very clear about it in his interview with Andrea Mitchell. He didn't change his position. He didn't run around giving interviews saying he's now against the Palestinian state." Dermer’s claim seems contrary to widespread analysis of Netanyahu’s record, so we wanted to find out if Netanyahu’s position had changed. What has Netanyahu said Netanyahu is on track to be the longest-serving prime minister in Israel’s statehood, elected to a fourth term in office with last week’s close election. Netanyahu had already miffed the Obama administration by accepting an invitation from congressional Republicans to denounce a possible Iranian nuclear deal in a Washington address. The water between them turned even hotter after a video interview published the day before Israel's March 17 general election on NRG, a right-leaning Israeli news website. Netanyahu said in Hebrew, according to a New York Times translation: "I think that anyone who is going to establish a Palestinian state today and evacuate lands is giving attack grounds to the radical Islam against the state of Israel. This is the genuine reality that has been created here in the past few years. Those who do not understand that bury their heads in the sand. The left-wing parties do it, bury their heads in the sand, time and again." The reporter asked, "But if you are the prime minister, a Palestinian state will not arise?" "Indeed," Netanyahu said. He went on: "An international initiative will be presented to us, to return to 1967 borders, to divide Jerusalem. Those are real things. It is going to happen. We need to form a strong, firm national government, headed by Likud (his party), to push those pressures away." Reports from the New York Times, Washington Post and others cast these comments as a departure from his 2009 speech at Bar-Ilan University, when Netanyahu endorsed a two-state solution -- with caveats -- to the conflict. Secretary of State John Kerry had been working on peace talks, of which the agreement of two states is the desired result, but those fell through last year. For supporters of a Palestinian state, Netanyahu’s present-day comments saying the two-state solution would not happen affirmed fears that he was never serious about pursuing that. But was it a true reversal? The backtracking Victory in hand, Netanyahu sought to clarify his comments about his support for a two-state solution in interviews with American media. On MSNBC, he told Andrea Mitchell, "I haven’t changed my policy. I never retracted my speech at Bar-Ilan University six years ago calling for a demilitarized Palestinian state that recognizes the Jewish state. What has changed is the reality. "Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian leader, refuses to recognize the Jewish state, has made a pact with Hamas that calls for the destruction of the Jewish state, and every territory that is vacated today in the Middle East is taken up by Islamist forces, so we want that to change so we can realize a vision of real, sustained peace," he said. His rhetoric had been consistent in the closing weeks of the election, as a Likud Party press release, according to the Post, quoted Netanyahu as saying "there will be no withdrawals and no concessions" because evacuated territory would fall to radical Iran-supported terror groups. A similar newsletter distributed by a Likud leader said Netanyahu had dismissed his Bar-Ilan speech as "null and void," according to this New York Times timeline of Netanyahu’s position on this issue. But when the party followed up by saying the support voiced at Bar-Ilan was "irrelevant," his office countered he had "never stated such a thing." Netanyahu doubled down that he did not change his position in an interview with NPR Morning Edition host Steve Inskeep, who pointed out that the comments were awkward because presidents before Obama had also pressed for the two-state solution. Inskeep asked if it was still Netanyahu’s position to be against a Palestinian state. "What I said was that under the present circumstances, today, it is unachievable," he said, citing the Palestinian Authority’s government with Hamas. "I said that the conditions have to change." Expert analysis What to make of Netanyahu’s words -- is he a flip-flopper or being taken out of context? Ultimately, it’s hard to know his true position. Jonathan Schanzer, Foundation for Defense of Democracies vice president for research and author of books on the conflict, offered several notes of context. First, and perhaps most importantly, Netanyahu’s support for the two-state solution has always been tepid, Schanzer said. In his first term that started in 1997, he opposed Palestinian statehood. The switch came at the university speech in 2009, and he reaffirmed in October 2014 his support for "a vision of peace of two states for two peoples based on mutual recognition and rock solid security arrangements on the ground" during a visit with Obama at the White House. For him to say now, unequivocally, that there would be no Palestinian state during his time in office may seem to indicate that he is against it on principle, Schanzer said, "but he didn’t say there would never be a two-state solution." To Schanzer, that is a fine distinction. Netanyahu always seemed reluctant to be part of the peace talks brokered by the United States, but he showed up anyway, Schanzer said. For him to acknowledge how poorly the talks have gone, and how unlikely they are to improve given the dwindling tenures of all leaders involved, "is actually a moment of honesty," he said. Still, the potentially candid assessment had convenient timing, as Netanyahu spent his final days of campaigning trying to consolidate Israel’s right-wing voters, who have several political party options unlike the United States. It was also in the election’s final days when Netanyahu warned in a video that Arab-Israelis were voting "in droves" and could threaten conservative rule, which critics saw as steeped in race-mongering. "The point is to say this was certainly done in the heat of the campaign," Schanzer said. "But I also believe that this does not discount the idea of a two-state solution moving forward permanently." Our ruling Dermer pushed back against widespread reports that Netanyahu changed his position on a two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict during the general elections. Dermer said, "He didn't change his position. He didn't run around giving interviews saying he's now against the Palestinian state." His position on this issue is much more complicated than Dermer lets on. Netanyahu has been all over the place. While he originally opposed Palestinian statehood, he has voiced support for a two-state peacemaking strategy as recently as October. Fast forward to this month: Netanyahu told a reporter for a right-leaning website that a Palestinian state wouldn’t happen under his watch. While he didn’t literally say he was "against the Palestinian state," his comments certainly signalled he would not be working toward that anytime soon." He has since clarified his position again, to say he supports the prospect of a Palestinian state, with caveats. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-04881	"Under Obama’s plan (for welfare), you wouldn’t have to work and wouldn’t have to train for a job. They just send you your welfare check."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/07/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-barack-obamas-plan-abandons-tenet/	Forget, for a moment, tax cuts and the fiscal cliff. Mitt Romney wants to talk about welfare. A Romney ad opens with a picture of President Bill Clinton signing the 1996 landmark welfare reform act, which shifted the program from indefinite government assistance to one based on steering people toward employment and self-reliance. The words "unprecedented success" flash on the screen. Clinton and a bipartisan Congress, a narrator says, "helped end welfare as we know it by requiring work for welfare." A leather-gloved laborer wipes sweat from his forehead. "But on July 12," the ad continues, "President Obama quietly announced a plan to gut welfare reform by dropping work requirements. Under Obama’s plan, you wouldn’t have to work and wouldn’t have to train for a job. They just send you your welfare check, and ‘welfare to work’ goes back to being plain old welfare." The July 12 announcement, made by the the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, allows states to try different ways of meeting the work requirements of the federal law. Does it really mean "they just send you your welfare check"? We decided to look further. The HHS memo Since 1996, welfare has been administered through block grants to states through a program called Temporary Assistance to Needy Families. TANF, as it’s called, limits how long families can get aid and requires recipients to eventually go to work. It also includes stringent reporting requirements for states to show they are successfully moving people off welfare and and into the workforce. A memo from George Sheldon, the acting assistant secretary at HHS, said the department wanted to give states more flexibility in meeting those requirements. The memo notifies states "of the Secretary’s willingness to exercise her waiver authority ... to allow states to test alternative and innovative strategies, policies, and procedures that are designed to improve employment outcomes for needy families." The memo outlined, using the jargon of a federal bureaucracy, the kinds of waivers that would be considered. It suggested projects that "improve collaboration with the workforce and/or post-secondary education systems" and "demonstrate strategies for more effectively serving individuals with disabilities," to give two examples. What does all that mean? "If you can do a better job connecting people to work, we would consider waiving certain parts of the performance measures and use alternate measures," is how Liz Schott, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, translated the memo’s point. (The center supports the plan.) Schott, who studies welfare policy, said TANF sets guidelines for what activities may count toward meeting the law’s work requirements: jobs, job training, internships or school, to name a few. Beyond that, it puts restrictions on how many hours a welfare client may spend at school, or how many consecutive months they can attend before that activity no longer counts toward the work requirement. The result: "States are running less-effective programs than they might be, because they are so driven by performance measurement as it’s set forth in the federal law," Schott said. The waivers, then, would allow for flexibility. For example, someone with a special-needs child might require different work arrangements than are currently allowed. Or a person who needs to improve his or her English skills might need more time to take classes. "It’s really about the underlying program," Schott said. "The real starting place is: What’s the most effective program to get this person to work?" Romney’s assertion In a memo released along with the ad, the Romney campaign says the change "undermines the very premise of welfare reform. It is an insult to Americans on welfare who are looking for an opportunity to build better lives for themselves. And it is a kick in the gut to the millions of hard-working middle-class taxpayers struggling in today’s economy, working more for less but always preferring self-sufficiency to a government handout." Obama, it says, "hopes states will consider approaches that remove work participation rate requirements all together." The HHS letter contains no such language. In several places, it says only proposals from states that "improve employment outcomes" will be considered. It’s important to note, however, that the waivers would not just be a change on paper. Schott said it’s possible that waivers will allow states to get credit under the work requirement for things that don’t count currently. That possibility has critics of the proposal up in arms. Robert Rector, a welfare expert with the conservative Heritage Foundation, said it could ultimately allow "state bureaucrats" to count activities that aren't really work. We should point out that those concerns are at odds with the policy's stated goal of encouraging employment. The Romney campaign also contends that HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius is not legally allowed to waive the existing work requirements. Rector argues that the part of the law allowing waivers does not cover TANF work provisions. "Critically, this section, as well as most other TANF requirements, is deliberately not listed... its provisions cannot be waived," Rector wrote in a July 12 column in the National Review. We think that’s a noteworthy point, but it’s one that a court will have to settle. Our ruling Romney’s ad says, "Under Obama’s plan (for welfare), you wouldn’t have to work and wouldn’t have to train for a job. They just send you your welfare check." That's a drastic distortion of the planned changes to Temporary Assistance to Needy Families. By granting waivers to states, the Obama administration is seeking to make welfare-to-work efforts more successful, not end them. What’s more, the waivers would apply to individually evaluated pilot programs -- HHS is not proposing a blanket, national change to welfare law. The ad tries to connect the dots to reach this zinger: "They just send you your welfare check." The HHS memo in no way advocates that practice. In fact, it says the new policy is "designed to improve employment outcomes for needy families." The ad’s claim is not accurate, and it inflames old resentments about able-bodied adults sitting around collecting public assistance. Pants on Fire!

pomt-09843	76 percent of Americans want a public health care option.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/20/progressive-change-campaign-committee/groups-claim-overwhelming-support-public-option/	A Web site called "We Want the Public Option" includes this headline at the top of the home page: "76% of Americans Say We Want the Public Option." The Web site also includes a video that has no voice-over, just a list of signatures supporting a public option in the health care reform plan, plus a smattering of statistics about reform. The signatures were collected by the two liberal groups — Democracy for America and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee — that paid for the ad. The ad aired for the first time on July 23, 2009, in Washington, D.C., and Montana. It's no longer on the air, but the video remains prominent on the Web site. The video opens with this claim: "76% of Americans support President Obama's public health insurance option." That number seemed high to us, especially in the light of recent polls, so we decided to check it. The statistic comes from a poll conducted June 12-15 by NBC News and the Wall Street Journal that asked, "In any health care proposal, how important do you feel it is to give people a choice of both a public plan administered by the federal government and a private plan for their health insurance — extremely important, quite important, not that important, or not at all important?" About 41 percent of respondents said it was extremely important, and about 35 percent said it was quite important. Add those numbers together, and you get 76 percent. But in the health care debate, June was a long time ago. Since that poll was published, rowdy town hall meetings and a barrage of criticism have made Americans more skeptical of health care reform. The public option has become less popular as well; several surveys done since that first NBC/ Wall Street Journal poll indicate declining support for a public plan. Here are just a few examples: • The Kaiser Family Foundation , a health care think tank, polled 1,205 people July 7-14 and found that 59 percent of people questioned would favor "a government-administered public health insurance option similar to Medicare to compete with private health insurance plans" and that 36 percent would oppose the idea. • A second NBC/ Wall Street Journal poll done July 24-27 asked 1,011 people whether they "would favor or oppose creating a public health care plan administered by the federal government that would compete directly with private health insurance companies." Forty-six percent said they would favor the plan while 44 percent said they opposed the idea. The two news organizations asked the same question to 805 people between Aug. 15-17 and found that 43 percent favor a public option and 47 percent who oppose it. Both statistics fall within the three-point margin of error of the July poll. • A New York Times/CBS poll of 1,050 people between July 24-28 asked whether they would "favor or oppose the government offering everyone a government administered health insurance plan — something like the Medicare coverage that people 65 and older get — that would compete with private health insurance plans." Around 66 percent favored the idea and 27 percent opposed it. • From July 27-Aug. 3, Quinnipiac University asked 2,409 voters whether they "support or oppose giving people the option of being covered by a government health insurance plan that would compete with private plans." Around 62 percent were in support and 32 percent were opposed. That's down from a July 1 Qunnipiac survey in which 69 percent supported the public option and 26 percent opposed it. House Democratic leaders and the group Health Care for America Now, which is supporting the Democratic plan, say the July and August NBC/ Wall Street Journal polls are misleading because they changed the framing of the question. Instead of asking if the choice of a public plan was important, they simply asked whether respondents were in favor of a public plan. "These polls are not comparable," the group wrote in it blog. "The first poll (June) accurately framed the question — should people be able to choose a public health insurance option. The second poll (July and August) pushed them towards an answer by leaving out the essential question of choice and asking a yes or no question." Regardless, these numbers are all over the map, and the only thing we can say with certainty is that they are each well below the 76 percent figure cited by Democracy for America and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. We also wondered whether the two groups accurately characterized the original NBC/ Wall Street Journal poll in the first place, and we got a mixed response. "It's fine to add those two numbers together," said Karlyn Bowman, resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. "But [respondents] were responding to a question about choice, not necessarily the idea of a public plan," she said. Democratic pollster Mark Mellman, president of the Mellman Group, said that the ad does a "fair reading of the question. Basically, you have 76 percent in favor of a choice." Humphrey Taylor, chairman the Harris Poll, Harris Interactive, agrees that the group characterized the two-month-old poll results correctly, but that "it's a mistake to say that large numbers of people support the public plan, because they don't understand what it would do," Taylor said, noting that "most people don't have an opinion until they are asked." Language often skews opinion polls, Taylor said. When it comes to the public plan, supporters often call it the "public option" while opponents call it a "government-run plan," so the Harris Poll tried to bridge that gap during a survey of 2,276 people between July 9-13. Respondents were asked whether they supported a "public, or government-sponsored, health plan," and the group found that 52 percent were in favor while 30 percent opposed the idea. That brings us back to the ad's original claim that 76 percent favor the public plan. That's a classic case of cherry-picking where they have found the highest number possible. They've also relied on a poll with wording that might lead people to think they were being asked if they favor choice in picking their health plan rather than whether they support a government-run option. Most of the other polls show support, but not nearly the landslide as the June poll. What's more, they continue to display the ad on their Web site even though the poll is sorely out of date and eclipsed by more recent and more precisely worded surveys. By most accounts, there's slightly more support for the public plan than there is opposition, but that support has dwindled throughout the summer. As a result, we give the Progressive Change Campaign Committee a False.	None	Progressive Change Campaign Committee	None	None	None	2009-08-20T15:22:40	2009-08-19	['United_States']
pomt-07669	"Any child born prematurely, according to the president, in his own words, can be killed."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/10/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-said-obama-said-any-child-born-prema/	It may seem early to some voters, but a few Republicans candidates for the 2012 presidential race are already on the trail in Iowa, the first caucus state. One is Rick Santorum, a former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania. Santorum recently spoke at a forum hosted by the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition, emphasizing that conservatives need to remain committed to social values, even though many expect the economy to be the most pressing issue of the election cycle. Opposition to abortion is particularly important, he said. "Any child born prematurely, according to the president, in his own words, can be killed," Santorum said, according to a column by Dana Milbank in the Washington Post. That’s a strong charge, so we decided to check it out. We turned to video from the forum to get Santorum’s complete comments. Part of his comments touched on the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act, a federal law he sponsored in the Senate. "It said that if a child was born out of a, quote, botched abortion, then that child is entitled to medical protection, entitled to treatment," Santorum said. Several states decided to copy the law. Santorum noted that Barack Obama, then an Illinois state legislator, opposed the state version of the law in Illinois. Obama "stood up and said that he opposed this bill because it would impinge on a woman’s rights under Roe v. Wade, and said, in fact, that any child prior to nine months of gestation would be able to be killed, otherwise it would impinge on Roe v. Wade," Santorum said. (See Santorum’s comments on C-SPAN.) "Any child born prematurely, according to the president, in his own words, can be killed," Santorum said. "Now who’s the extremist in the abortion debate?" We researched Obama’s position on "born alive" legislation extensively during the presidential campaign. Obama favors abortion rights generally, and he opposed the state version of Illinois’ "born alive" measure as a state senator. But he never said that premature children, even those who survived an abortion, could be killed. 'Born Alive' in Illinois When Obama was a state senator, abortion opponents proposed "born alive" legislation in 2001, 2002 and 2003. The proposals’ intent was to require doctors to provide immediate life-saving care to any infant that survived an intended abortion. The legislation, which included multiple bills, specified that an infant surviving a planned abortion is "born alive" and "shall be fully recognized as a human person and accorded immediate protection under the law." The bills' supporters said it gave added emphasis to laws already on the books, deterring the death of abortion survivors from neglect. (One of the bills' strongest supporters was a nurse who said she had witnessed infants left to die in dirty utility rooms.) Abortion-rights proponents, on the other hand, said the legislation was a back-door attempt to stop legal abortions. Illinois already had a law on its books from 1975 that said if a doctor suspected an abortion was scheduled for a viable fetus — meaning able to survive outside of the mother's body — then the child must receive medical care if it survives the abortion. The new laws didn't distinguish between viable and nonviable, meaning that an infant of any age that survived an abortion should receive care. Obama, along with other Democrats in the Illinois legislature, opposed the "born alive" laws every time they came up. Over the years, Obama offered several reasons he opposed the legislation. Back in 2001, legislative transcripts show that Obama questioned part of the "born alive" legislation package because he said it would be struck down by the courts for giving legal status to fetuses. In 2002, Obama discussed a different aspect of the legislation, which required a second doctor be present at abortions. Obama said he thought that legislation was intended to make abortion more difficult to obtain, not to provide better care for the "born alive." There is no record of his remarks in 2003 because the bill never made it out of committee, and the committee proceedings were not recorded. The 'neutrality' clause debated The federal legislation (the law Santorum sponsored in the Senate) became law in 2002. The federal legislation included a so-called "neutrality clause," which said the law would not change the legal status or legal rights of anyone prior to being "born alive." Abortion rights advocates said the clause was necessary to make sure the bill would not affect current abortion laws. Obama said as far back as 2004 that he would have supported the federal bill and that he would have supported the Illinois versions if they had included a similar neutrality clause. The laws the full Illinois Senate voted on in 2001 and 2002 did not have such a clause, but 2003 is a different story. The National Right to Life Committee said during the 2008 campaign that the Illinois bill of 2003 did have a neutrality clause. The committee said Obama subsequently misrepresented the bill. Obama responded to that charge in an August 2008 interview. "I hate to say that people are lying, but here's a situation where folks are lying," Obama said. "I have said repeatedly that I would have been completely in, fully in support of the federal bill that everybody supported, which was to say that you should provide assistance to any infant that was born even if it was as a consequence of an induced abortion." Back in 2008, we requested documentation from the Illinois State Archives about the 2003 bill and found that it did have a neutrality clause, as the National Right to Life Committee said. (The clause was added at the committee level, and those records are not available online. But we have posted the documents we received via fax from the State Archives here). But there is an important caveat to add here: We don't know what the discussion was at the 2003 committee meeting because the proceedings weren't recorded, but it seems likely that the federal neutrality clause was not considered sufficient at the state level, because the 2005 Illinois law that eventually passed included a more extensive neutrality clause than the federal legislation. To read more about the differences between the neutrality clauses, read our previous detailed fact-check here. Obama’s comments With Santorum reviving the issue of "born alive" legislation, we went back again to check the transcripts from the Illinois legislature. Obama did say he opposed the bill because it wouldn’t pass constitutional muster under Roe v. Wade. But he never said that "any child prior to nine months of gestation would be able to be killed" or that "any child born prematurely … can be killed," as Santorum said. In fact, Obama said in 2001 that there were "a number of members who are typically in favor of a woman’s right to choose an abortion (who) were actually sympathetic to some of the concerns" raised by supporters of the legislation. In 2002, Obama said that he thought Illinois already had laws sufficient to ensure that children that survived abortion received care. The proposed law would have required two doctors instead of one in the case of a live birth to ensure that care would be provided. "If these are children who are being born alive, I, at least, have confidence that a doctor who is in the room is going to make sure that they’re looked after," Obama said then. At no time did Obama say that children born prematurely can be legally killed. We contacted Santorum’s political action committee, America’s Foundation, for comment. Spokeswoman Virginia Davis said that Obama’s votes against the state measure showed he supported killing children who were born alive. "By his statements and votes, (fully documented by the lead advocate of this legislation in Illinois and at the federal level), and as verified by Factcheck.org, then-state Senator Barack Obama several times voiced opposition to, and voted against legislation that, protected a child scheduled to be aborted -- and was born alive -- from being killed," David said via e-mail. We should note that the Factcheck.org report noted Obama’s positions on the Illinois measures but reiterated his support for the federal legislation. "Whether opposing ‘born alive’ legislation is the same as supporting ‘infanticide,’ however, is entirely a matter of interpretation," the report noted. Our ruling To reiterate what’s not in dispute: Obama opposed "born alive" legislation in Illinois and gave several reasons for opposing the proposals. But at no time did he make the argument that infants who survived botched abortions should be killed. Santorum may feel that abortion is tantamount to infanticide, but that does not give him the license to put words in Obama's mouth that he never uttered. Santorum said, "Any child born prematurely, according to the president, in his own words, can be killed." Obama didn’t say that. In fact, he said that abortion should be legal, but that children that are born should receive medical care. Obama never said that any child born prematurely can be killed or anything like that. Santorum crosses a line with his rhetoric in distinguishing the difference between his position and Obama’s. We rate Santorum’s statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-09361	"As a state rep, I was considered the fourth-most conservative in the Legislature.”	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/apr/01/rick-green/green-says-he-was-fouth-most-conservative-texas-ho/	Rick Green of Dripping Springs, in an April 13 Republican primary runoff for a seat on the Texas Supreme Court, told a Montgomery County group that voters don’t have to guess his judicial philosophy -- they can look at his legislative voting record. Green served two terms in the Texas House from 1999 to 2003; he lost his seat in 2002 to Democrat Patrick Rose. According to a video of his Jan. 14 Montgomery County remarks posted on his campaign Web site, Green encouraged listeners to check his House history, saying: "As a state rep, I was considered the fourth-most conservative in the Legislature.” Is that so? To support his claim, Green's campaign pointed us to the 1999 Texas Conservative Report, a publication of the Free Enterprise PAC, an advocate for limited government and "traditional values." It has since become the Heritage Alliance PAC. The 1999 report tracks dozens of votes made by every legislator in that year's regular session. To evaluate House members, a panel chose 64 votes on "economic, social, governmental and education issues" that the group said “showed signs of a liberal or conservative philosophy.” Lawmakers were graded based on the number of times they voted with the conservative position. Green and two other members of the 150-member House voted the group's preferred way 88 percent of the time; only three members leaned the group's way more often. (The average score was 43 percent.) By that measure, Green shared the “fourth-most conservative” honors with GOP Reps. John Davis of Houston and Charlie Howard of Sugar Land. Senators were rated separately, leaving Green's statement open to interpretation whether he was claiming to be the fourth-most conservative in the whole Legislature (which would be an overstatement) or just the House (which was accurate). The report lists 28 criteria that define how positions were identified as conservative, including if legislation made government more efficient, strengthened the family's importance as the foundation of the nation, reduced the overall tax burden or protected a citizen's ability to make a living. In summarizing its ratings, the group highlighted 12 votes on topics ranging from property taxes to abortion to standardized testing. One vote was on a bill that would have expanded the state's hate crimes law by, among other things, enhancing criminal penalties and specifying which groups would be protected against bias crimes, including those targeted because of their "race, color, disability, religion, national origin or ancestry, age, status as a pregnant person, gender, or sexual preference." The Free Enterprise PAC said "nay" was the conservative vote in this case because the measure would have given "special rights to an individual or group" and did not support "traditional Judeo/Christian moral values." Green was in the minority in voting no. That bill eventually failed, though a hate crimes measure later passed into law during the 2001 legislative session. Green also received a thumbs-up from the group for voting against a bill requiring people younger than 18 to wear a bicycle helmet when riding on public roads or paths. That measure did not become law. All in all, Green was one of 32 House members the group designated a Leader of Excellence in 1999. Not noted by Green in Montgomery County: Based on some of his votes in the 2001 legislative session -- Green's last -- he slipped in the group's conservative rankings. Not that Green became a liberal. The group's 2001 report states that Green took its favored position 65 percent of the time, compared to a House average of 34 percent. He tied with three others as the 11th-most conservative House member. Thirty members sided more often with the group's preferred positions. Green, who served on Heritage Alliance's board of directors from March through November 2009, was not designated a Leader of Excellence by the group in 2001 because he sided with it in less than 70 percent of the rated votes. As before, the group's 2001 report spotlights 12 votes, which covered topics ranging from the death penalty to the minimum wage to mental illness. The votes included two that the group penalized Green for, both voice votes, in which passage is determined by choruses of "ayes" and "nays" on the House floor. The first was on a proposal to mandate that health insurance policies in Texas cover anorexia and bulimia as serious mental illnesses, and the second was on a bill requiring the state attorney general's office to use gender-neutral terminology in publications. Neither became law. For both, the group's preferred position was to oppose them. When we asked Heritage Alliance President Richard Ford how the group was able to tell tell whether a legislator had voted yes or no in those instances, he said he could not recall how those votes were treated because the report was done so long ago. We have a hunch why the group marked Green as voting the wrong way on the two bills. After a voice vote is held, individual members may request that their vote be separately recorded as for or against. It appears that Free Enterprise gave conservative credit only to the lawmakers who did that on those two measures, and Green was not one of them, according to the House Journal. His wife, Kara Green, the campaign's treasurer, said her husband did not support either measure. Summing up: Green accurately recaps his conservative ranking — albeit by a single group, the Free Enterprise PAC, during his first of two terms. He omits the fact that he was not considered fourth-most conservative in his second term, according to the group. We rate his statement as Half True.

pomt-08087	Says that in his first 17 months as president, the United States doubled its world-leading $500 million a year commitment to fighting global AIDS.	true	/texas/statements/2010/dec/16/george-w-bush/president-bush-says-united-states-doubled-its-comm/	President George W. Bush devotes a chapter of his memoir, Decision Points, to his interest in stopping AIDS abroad. "When I took office, the United States was spending a little over $500 million a year to fight global AIDS," Bush writes. "That was more than any other country. Yet it was paltry compared with the scope of the pandemic." In May 2001, he writes, he endorsed the creation of a Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, making an initial U.S. pledge of $200 million, an amount increased to $500 million by early 2002. And in June 2002, he writes, he announced the International Mother and Child HIV Prevention Initiative. "In 17 months," Bush said, "we had doubled America's commitment to fighting global AIDS." By the time Bush completed his second term, in early 2009, such annual U.S. spending exceeded $5 billion, according to a breakdown posted online in February 2010 by the Kaiser Family Foundation. But we wanted the back story. We started from an October 2009 PolitiFact inquiry, per a statement by U2's Bono, who credited Bush with tripling U.S. spending against AIDS in Africa. In 2008, the United States accounted for more than half (51.3 percent) of all the the global AIDs relief disbursed by governments around the world, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation and UNAIDS. When adjusted for the relative size of the countries' economies, the United States ranked fourth highest, considerably higher than most European countries. The only ones that spent more proportionately were the Netherlands, United Kingdom and Bono's homeland, Ireland. Kaiser spokesman Craig Palosky passed along a June 2004 report, "Analysis of aid in support of HIV/AIDS control, 2000-2002," whose authors include a program run by the United Nations. A table in the report shows the United States donated the most money to the AIDS fight in 2000, accounting for $329 million in such funding. The United Kingdom ranked a distant second, at $117 million. In 2003, Bush initiated a $15 billion plan to address global AIDS relief, mostly for countries in Africa where the AIDS epidemic is staggering. And then in 2008, Congress — Democrats and Republicans alike — more than tripled the HIV/AIDS relief budget to $48 billion over five years. We asked Eric Lief, a former senior advisor with the U.N. Joint Program on HIV/AIDS, to analyze Bush's statement about funding. (Lief now works for the Henry L. Stimson Center, a non-partisan public policy institute.) Via e-mail, he said: "The Bush administration showed real leadership on global HIV/AIDS. U.S. funding grew exponentially during the eight Bush years. But global funding is still far short of anything close to global need." For particulars, Lief pointed us to a December 2006 Congressional Research Service report, "Trends in U.S. Global AIDS Spending: FY2000-FY2007." In fiscal 2000, the year before Bush was sworn in as president, annual U.S. spending on global HIV/AIDS assistance and to combat TB and malaria totaled $236.1 million, the report says. It totaled $564.5 million in fiscal 2001 and a little more than $1 billion in fiscal 2002. Subtracting out what Lief told us was the share of funding focused on battling TB and malaria, we estimated AIDS-specific funding at $518 million for fiscal 2001 and $930 million the year after--amounting to an increase of about 80 percent. Finally, we heard back from David Drake, a representative of Bush's publisher, the Crown Publishing Group, after asking him for evidence behind Bush's statement. Drake said in an e-mail that by the end of June 2002, Bush had committed $500 million to the Global Fund and another $500 million to the International Mother and Child HIV Prevention Initiative. A former Bush adviser, Jay Lekfowitz, writes in a January 2009 article in Commentary magazine that the initiative was intended to increase the availability of preventive care, including drug treatments, and to devise delivery systems that would reach pregnant women and newborn children in two Caribbean nations and eight African ones (with four to be added later). Drake said Bush announced the second $500 million on June 19, 2002, just before the end of his 17th month as president. He was sworn in Jan. 20, 2001. We rate Bush's statement True.	None	George W.

pomt-01392	Says President Barack Obama’s recent New York fundraising trip "cost between $25 million and $50 million."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/oct/14/donald-trump/trump-obama-fundraising-trip-cost-25-50-million/	With President Barack Obama’s low approval ratings already weighing down Democrats in the mid-term elections, his Republican critics like nothing better than giving voters more reasons to think less of him. Accordingly, billionaire and occasional presidential aspirant Donald Trump called out Obama for the cost of his recent New York fundraising trip. "He raises a million dollars and it costs between $25 million and $50 million, and they close up the entire city of New York," Trump said Oct. 13 on Fox News’ Fox and Friends. We reached out to Trump to learn where he got his numbers and didn’t hear back. But we wondered, would a one-day New York trip cost between "$25 million and $50 million"? The president made a one-day trip between Washington and New York on Oct. 7. According to the White House schedule, from take-off at Andrews Air Force Base to return took a bit over nine hours. In New York and Connecticut, Obama attended two events for the Democratic National Committee and one for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Obama traveled to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York via Air Force One, which is the call sign for one of two 747 jets specially equipped with communications gear so the president is always able to respond in an emergency. According to a 2012 report from the Congressional Research Service, the policy arm of Congress, the hourly cost of Air Force One is $179,750. On domestic trips, a cargo aircraft and a backup aircraft normally accompany Air Force One. For the purposes of Trump’s calculation, that would put the total cost of the air travel between $360,000 and $1.6 million, assuming a range of two and nine hours of usage time for Air Force One. Note: Under the rules of presidential travel, when the purpose of a trip is political, not official, the president’s political organization reimburses the government. For airfare, the price is based on the cost of a commercial ticket for the president and all those who accompany him. In this case, the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee would be on the hook. In addition to the aircraft, there would have been a Secret Service cost, but those figures are classified. There also would be security costs for the New York Police Department. To get a fuller picture of what the cost of presidential travel is, we have to go back to 1999 for a more comprehensive accounting. That year, the Government Accountability Office, Congress’s auditing division, looked at the price tag for three foreign trips taken by President Bill Clinton. Again, these numbers don’t include the Secret Service expenses, or the pre-trip planning. But they do include pretty much everything else. (We adjusted the 1998 dollars to account for inflation.) Trip Total days Daily cost (2014 dollars) Africa - six nations 12 $5.1 million/day Chile 5 $3 million/day China 9 $3 million/day Foreign travel requires much more staff and equipment than the one-day jaunt Obama made to New York City. In Africa, for example, the Marines sent a helicopter squadron. The Air Force deployed five additional planes and ran refueling missions. The Chilean trip pulled in about 600 staffers from a variety of agencies. There were hotels and meals to pay for. While we can’t know all the details of Obama’s New York jaunt, there is no evidence that it approached the complexity of either of the lower cost trips in the GAO report. And if those trips halfway around the world came in at about $3 million per day (in today’s dollars), it is extremely likely that a back-and-forth to New York would cost less. Much less. Bottom line: Presidential travel is expensive, but Trump’s estimate of Obama’s fundraising trip to New York is wildly high, based on everything we know.

pomt-05421	Says "Austin has the lowest property tax rate by far of the five major cities in Texas."	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/may/01/lee-leffingwell/lee-leffingwell-says-austin-has-lowest-property-ta/	Two days before city staffers discussed raising Austin’s property tax levy, Mayor Lee Leffingwell touted the city’s rate in a televised debate. Facing off against mayoral opponents Brigid Shea and Clay Dafoe in an April 16, 2012, forum on KXAN-TV, Channel 36, Leffingwell said, "The City of Austin has the lowest property tax rate by far of the five major cities in Texas, including Fort Worth, Houston, Dallas and San Antonio." Does that add up? By email, Leffingwell campaign consultant Mark Littlefield and city spokesman Reyne Telles told us that Leffingwell used data from a chart prepared by city staff for its annual five-year financial forecast. Littlefield sent us that chart plus a second one showing estimated tax bills in each city. Ed Van Eenoo, Austin’s city budget officer, told us by email that his office created the charts with 2011 tax rates, home values and sales price information from county appraisal districts and the Real Estate Center at Texas A&M University. We checked the numbers with the districts and center, and found Austin’s property tax rate was the lowest, considerably, of Texas’ five biggest cities, as Leffingwell said. The full list: Fort Worth, 85.5 cents per $100 of appraised value; Dallas, 79.7 cents; Houston, 63.875 cents; San Antonio, 56.5569 cents, Austin, 48.11 cents. But tax rates are only part of the equation when it comes to figuring out how hard a homeowner’s pocketbook gets hit. Here, in fact, is the equation, from Austin’s budget office: Take your house’s dollar value; subtract any homestead or other exemptions; divide by 100; then multiply by the tax rate -- with the tax rate expressed in dollars; for example, 0.4811 rather than "48.11 cents." We calculated how much typical homeowners had to pay in 2011 using two different measures: average appraised values from each county tax appraisal districts, and median sales price from the center, which gets data from real estate professionals across the state. Although exemptions affect many tax bills, we excluded them here because they vary with each homeowner and each city, county and taxing jurisdiction. In 2011, Austin had both the highest median sale price and the highest average appraised value among the five cities. But because of the city’s low tax rate, Austin’s tax bill (excluding exemptions) on an average-value home was second-highest, and its tax bill on a median sales-price home came in fourth. Calculated using 2011 median sales price and 2011 city tax rate, Dallas had the highest bill -- $1,262 on a $158,400 house -- followed by Houston’s $982 on a $153,700 house, Fort Worth’s $946 bill on a $110,600 house, Austin’s $918 on a $190,900 house and San Antonio’s $856 on a $151,300 house. Using the same tax rates and 2011’s average appraised values, Dallas was first again, with a $1,441 bill on a $180,847 house, followed by Austin’s $1,224 bill on a $254,328 house, Houston’s $1,057 on a $165,535 house, Fort Worth’s $968 on a $113,247 house and San Antonio’s $725 on a $128,151 house. Median home sale price, 2011 2011 city tax bill using median sale price Average appraised home value, 2011 2011 city tax bill using average appraised value 1. Austin, $190,900 1. Dallas, $1,262 1. Austin, $254,328 1. Dallas, $1,441 2. Dallas, $158,400 2. Houston, $982 2. Dallas, $180,847 2. Austin, $1,224 3. Houston, $153,700 3. Fort Worth, $946 3. Houston, $165,535 3. Houston, $1,057 4. San Antonio, $151,300 4. Austin, $918 4. San Antonio, $128,151 4. Fort Worth, $968 5. Fort Worth, $110,600 5. San Antonio, $856 5. Fort Worth, $113,247 5. San Antonio, $725 Because averages can be skewed by a few very high or low values, taking the median value offers a way to dampen the effect of those extremes. Medians represent a "middle" value -- median sales price would be the dollar amount at which half a city's homes sold for more and half sold for less. The city's tax bill chart used median sales prices, except for Austin, where the median appraised home value was available, and factored in homestead exemptions. Reckoned that way, Austin’s tax bill again came out second-highest. Of course, cities are only one of the entities taking a chomp out of your property taxes. Depending on where your house is, county government, school districts, community colleges and possibly many others get a bite. The Austin owner of a $190,900 home in 2011, for example, paid $2,371 to the Austin school district; $927 to Travis County; $181 to Austin Community College; and $151 to Central Health (Travis County’s healthcare district) on top of the $918 city tax bill. Also, Austinites recently learned that 2013 might bring an increase in the city’s rate. The Austin American-Statesman reported April 18 that the owner of a median-value home would pay $33 more under a tax rate of 49.95 cents per $100 of property -- the rate city staffers said Austin would need to cover its costs next year. Leffingwell responded to the news with a statement that he would look for ways to cut spending rather than raise the property tax rate. That 49.95-cent rate for 2012 is still lower than the other cities’ 2011 rates, but it’s too early to know what all the 2012 rates -- and home values -- will be. Our ruling Leffingwell’s right on the rates. Austin had the lowest 2011 city property tax rate among Texas’ five biggest cities. Yet rates alone are not the only, or even best, indicator of how much residents have been socked by property taxes. Comparing each city’s average-value home in 2011, for instance, Austin would have extracted the second-highest tax payment. Without this context, Leffingwell’s rate comparison misrepresents this pocketbook issue. His claim rates Half True.

pomt-05900	In just a few decades, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, other mandatory spending programs, and paying interest due on the debt will eclipse our entire budget.	true	/oregon/statements/2012/feb/03/kurt-schrader/will-entitlement-programs-and-debt-swamp-federal-r/	Members of Congress and politicians like to use dramatic language to describe the nation’s fiscal problems. Federal spending, they say, is like "a runaway train." The GOP’s front-runner for president, Mitt Romney, famously said, "We’re inches away from no longer having a free economy." The rhetoric on the nation’s deficit is similar. "A government that loses its sovereignty to its bondholders cannot long guarantee its people’s prosperity – or secure their freedom," the budget written last year by House Republicans said. Oregon Rep. Kurt Schrader, a Democrat, is a bit more restrained, though his prediction is equally grim. "In just a few decades, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, other mandatory spending programs, and paying interest due on the debt will eclipse our entire budget,’’ he says on his congressional website. "There will be NO money left for defense, Pell Grants, support for K-12 education, police and firefighters, economic development, transportation infrastructure, and everything else which creates and sustains a country for our children," he says in words meant to envision a fiscal nuclear winter. It is grim and dark to be sure. But is it true? To answer it, we have to narrow the discussion. Schrader’s assertion that there will be "NO money left" for popular programs dealing with education, public safety and infrastructure is impossible to answer because Congress has broad discretion for appropriating dollars to those activities -- or raising taxes to pay for them. And even amid desperate fiscal meltdowns Congress has excelled at finding ways to pay for popular programs. So let’s examine the first part of Schrader’s claim - that in a relatively short time, the cost of the big entitlement programs - Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid - and interest payments on the national debt will "eclipse our entire budget." If you take the statement at its literal meaning, it is false. Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and interest are always part of the annual budget. Just like rent or mortgage, groceries and credit card debt are always part of a household budget. The spending can never eclipse the budget because the items are always contained within the total budget. Schrader’s staff says the language is imprecise but the meaning isn’t - that entitlements and debt will swamp federal revenues in the near future. It’s one of those, "It’s not what we say, it’s what we mean" moments. Taken that way there is a lot of data to support the idea. In fact, independent budget analysts using federal data say Schrader is being generous. According to budget simulations run by the Government Accountability Office, the total cost of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and debt service would exceed total revenues in 2026 for the first time in history. The fiscal year 2012 budget released last year by the Republican-controlled House Budget Committee said this: "In 1970, these major entitlements consumed about 20 percent of the budget – a number that has grown to over 40 percent today. Unless action is taken to reform these programs, they will continue to crowd out all other national priorities until they break the federal budget." Other government reports look at individual pieces. But together they reach the same conclusion. The Congressional Budget Office, for example, noted similar concerns in a long-term outlook released in June. The federal debt is growing, reaching 62 percent of gross domestic product at the end of 2010. The non-partisan budget office noted similar growth trends for Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, concluding "the total amount of benefits scheduled to be paid under current law will grow faster than the economy." The numbers are clear as are the trends. With the explosive growth in entitlements and the government’s need to borrow more to keep pace, there is little doubt that the lines will cross soon on the graph of revenues versus spending. The only question is when. To rule, we need to decide first if the distinction between "the budget" that Schrader referred to and total revenues, which includes the debt and all the entitlement programs, is a difference that matters. We think that, while his language could have been more precise, the average person would understand what he was talking about. Context matters in PolitiFact rulings, and in context, his remarks make his meaning clear. On the math, Schrader’s estimate of "a few decades" is very reasonable, under present circumstances. For that reason we rate this claim: True.	None	Kurt Schrader	None	None	None	2012-02-03T16:13:50	2012-02-02	['Medicare_(United_States)', 'Social_Security_(United_States)']
pomt-11534	Says he is "one of America's leading consumer lawyers."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/feb/15/tim-burns/tim-burns-who-mostly-represents-businesses-suing-i/	Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate Tim Burns, a Democrat outspoken about his liberal political views, describes himself as the grandson of Mississippi sharecroppers who is running for "people who struggle." In his first TV ad, released Feb. 6, 2018, the Madison attorney portrays himself in a similar vein when the narrator says: Meet Tim Burns. He grew up without much and became one of America’s leading consumer lawyers. But if you’re picturing an attorney who mainly represents individuals,that’s not Burns. Burns, who faces left-leaning Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Rebecca Dallet and conservative Sauk County Circuit Court Judge Michael Screnock in the Feb. 20, 2018 primary, has represented individuals in some class-action lawsuits. But his specialty is representing big businesses, not consumers, that sue their insurance companies. And leaving aside the claim in his TV ad, Burns has often described himself as having major business clients, not as a consumer lawyer. Overview of Burns’ legal background A Milwaukee Journal Sentinel review of Burns’ legal background found: He has a law practice that focuses on suing insurers. His clients have included a mining company that couldn’t get an insurance payout when a Colorado quarry collapsed in a landslide and all mining ceased; and Stryker Corp., a Michigan manufacturer suing its insurer because the insurer denied coverage for injury claims filed by people who alleged the company’s "Uni-knee" knee replacement product was defective and caused injuries. Burns told the Journal Sentinel about representing Stryker: "I wasn’t representing the client against the little guy. I was representing the client against the big insurance company. … What I’m trying to do is to get the insurance company to pay for the problem because insurance companies have promised to pay for problems." But, to be clear, in that case Burns was not representing an individual suing a hip replacement manufacturer. Rather, he was representing the manufacturer in a lawsuit, with the manufacturer trying to get its insurance company to pay individuals for claims about injuries caused by its products. That’s in contrast to consumer attorneys such as Milwaukee lemon law lawyer Vince Megna, who built his career by suing car dealers and manufacturers, and ran for the Supreme Court in 2013. Burns’ evidence To back Burns’ claim about being a consumer lawyer, his campaign began its description of Burns’ legal work to us by saying he built a national practice representing policyholders, "otherwise known as insurance consumers." Burns himself told us: "I’m using a dictionary definition of consumer," in that businesses consume insurance. "I am 100 percent a consumer lawyer," he said. But the usual understanding of a consumer -- particularly in the context of Burns’ campaigning as a fighter for ordinary people -- is an individual. The understanding is not that a business is a consumer simply because it buys insurance. Burns’ campaign also cited to us a page from the website of Perkins Coie; Burns is a partner in the Seattle-based law firm’s Madison office. That page says the firm’s insurance recovery attorneys (Burns is one) have helped shape "pro-policyholder law." But the page doesn’t mention consumers. In contrast, the firm touts having represented "leading companies in almost every industry, including Fortune 500 and Global 500 companies, as well as public sector policyholders." Burns’ campaign also cited a handful of cases in which Burns represented individuals. In a 2015 lawsuit, for example, he and other lawyers represented a New York man in a class-action lawsuit. The suit claimed MetLife was not setting aside the required reserves for the purpose of paying potential insurance claims and that MetLife should reimburse him and the other class members for premiums they paid. But by and large, Burns’s clients are not individuals, but businesses -- as he himself has stated on at least three occasions. Burns’ own statements 1. Answering candidate questions from the nonpartisan Wisconsin Policy Forum, Burns emphasized his business clients when he wrote: I’ve built a national practice as one of America’s leading attorneys in standing up to massive insurance companies. I have been hired by major businesses in three dozen states and 10 foreign countries to handle their most sensitive insurance issues, but I’ve also represented regular working people in class actions seeking to hold insurance companies accountable for financial fraud …. In the current field of candidates and on the current Supreme Court, I have the most experience working with American businesses by far. I’ve been hired by the many of the top manufacturing, banking, and investment companies in the world or their boards of directors to advise them on their most sensitive issues concerning liability and insurance. 2. His campaign website also touts major clients, saying: Tim is one of America's leading attorneys in standing up to large insurance companies. Tim has been hired by major clients in three dozen states and ten foreign countries to handle their most sensitive issues. 3. The profile Burns put on the business networking site LinkedIn says: Tim Burns is a member of the Insurance Recovery Practice group at Perkins Coie LLP. The Insurance Recovery Practice group has more than thirty lawyers who devote their practice to representing corporate policyholders in insurance coverage matters. And Burns’s profile on his law firm’s website also cites business: Tim is favorably ranked in the 2006 (Illinois), 2007 (recommended in "Insurance" nationally), and 2008 to 2016 (Band 2 - nationally) editions of Chambers USA: America's Leading Lawyers for Business. The picture is clear. Our rating Burns says he is "one of America's leading consumer lawyers." The bulk of his legal work is not representing individual consumers, but rather large businesses that are suing their insurers. We rate Burns’ statement False.

pomt-05273	Says he "restored prayer and the pledge in our schools."	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/may/25/jeff-wentworth/jeff-wentworth-says-he-restored-prayer-and-pledge-/	In a TV ad, Republican state Sen. Jeff Wentworth’s campaign shows a woman assuring a friend in a coffee shop that Wentworth, who seeks re-election, is "a solid conservative." She lists Wentworth accomplishments, including that "he restored prayer and the pledge in our schools." We were curious about that claim, in part because voluntary student prayer has been protected, though a landmark 1962 U.S. Supreme Court decision barred school-organized prayer which it called a violation of the First Amendment. In a telephone interview, Wentworth said his ad is based on his 2003 proposal, passed into law, giving students a regular opportunity to pray and requiring that they recite the U.S. pledge of allegiance and the pledge to the Texas flag. The approved proposal requires students to recite the U.S. and Texas pledges of allegiance once each school day, to be followed by a one-minute moment of silence in which "each student may, as the student chooses, reflect, pray, meditate or engage in any other silent activity that is not likely to interfere with or distract another student." The law also says that during the quiet time, school employees are to "ensure that each of those students remains silent and does not act in a manner that is likely to interfere with or distract another student." With a written request from a parent or guardian, the law says, a student can be excused from saying the pledges. There is no opt-out for the minute of silence. Wentworth’s proposal made mandatory a moment of silence that had been optional under a 1995 law. That law did not explicitly mention prayer as something students could do during that time. But lawmakers in 1995 also added a section to the Texas Education Code stating: "A public school student has an absolute right to individually, voluntarily, and silently pray or meditate in school in a manner that does not disrupt the instructional or other activities of the school." So, the measure authored by Wentworth resulted in students having daily minutes of silence, permitting prayer, and in their reciting the pledges. But were both practices "restored," as his ad says? Certainly, Wentworth told us, in that his proposal was intended to restore customs he had appreciated growing up in San Antonio. The 1962 court decision ended school prayer as he’d known it, he said, though no court decisions limited students from saying the pledges. Still, he said, constituents had come to him concerned their children were not saying the pledges; practices varied from school district to school district and school to school. "I decided it needed to be uniform and required across the state," he said. We failed to pin how many schools were holding minutes of silence or already had students reciting either pledge before Wentworth acted. News accounts suggest, though, that the U.S. pledge was being recited in multiple schools and minutes of silence were occasionally observed. An April 15, 2003, Houston Chronicle news article said the Houston school district and most area districts such as Fort Bend and Clear Creek allowed principals to determine whether students recited the pledge and observed a minute of silence. The story also said: ** Students in all Pearland district schools recited the pledge to the Texas and U.S. flags daily. ** All 44 schools in the Conroe district daily recited the pledge (though the story did not specify which pledge). ** Most schools in the Katy district recited the pledge (also unspecified) and observed a minute of silence. On April 24, 2003, the Chronicle reported that most schools in the Cypress-Fairbanks, Klein, Magnolia, Spring and Tomball districts reserved a time for students to recite the U.S. pledge. None observed a minute of silence on a regular basis. A May 8, 2003 Chronicle news story quoted Diane Jackson, the Spring Branch school district executive administrator for government engagement, policy and administration, saying that most of the district’s 45 schools already had students say the U.S. pledge, while some also observed a moment of silence. An Aug. 4, 2003, El Paso Times news article reported that students in most El Paso County schools said the pledge of allegiance daily before the requirement was passed. Most did not observe a moment of silence, the story said. A September 2, 2003, Dallas Morning News article said that in the area’s schools, many students had recited the pledge of allegiance for years, but the mandated moment of silence would be a change. The story quoted Rep. Dan Branch, R-Dallas and a House sponsor of the Wentworth measure, saying that the previous year, about half the elementary school students in Dallas County had regularly said the pledge, though hardly any students said the Texas pledge. Debbie Ratcliffe, spokeswoman for the Texas Education Agency, told us that the agency was not aware of any data collected on the pre-2003 prevalence of pledge recitations, though she believes it was common for students to say at least the U.S. pledge. Joy Baskin, director of legal services for the Texas Association of School Boards, told us in a telephone interview that she did not know of research on earlier practices, but said she thinks it was widespread for boards to require students to recite the U.S. pledge every day. Wentworth said during the 2003 legislative session that the minute-of-silence requirement was not a move to bring organized prayer back into the classroom. "The goal is to instill loyalty and patriotism in public school students, and give them the opportunity to have 60 seconds of quiet at the beginning of the school day" Wentworth was quoted as saying in an April 9, 2003, Dallas Morning News news article. The story also quoted Wentworth as saying: "It is not school prayer. The language of the bill is very clear about that. … It would not allow audible prayer." Sen. Juan Hinojosa, D-McAllen, objected during Senate debate of the bill, according to an April 10, 2003, San Antonio Express-News news article, and said: "What you're doing is mandating prayer in schools." The story says Wentworth disagreed, pointing to language in the legislation statingl that students could use the minute to reflect, pray, meditate or engage in any other silent activity that's not distracting. "This bill does not mandate prayer in public schools," Wentworth said, according to the article. "Of course it does," Hinojosa said. "Of course it doesn't," Wentworth said. Wentworth told us that he that he made those comments to prevent his measure -- modeled on a Virginia law that passed court muster -- from potentially being construed as a violation of the 1962 Supreme Court ruling, not because he believed it did not allow students to pray. "We’re talking about a very fine legal line," he said. The Texas law survived a 2006 court challenge by a Dallas-area couple with three children attending school in the Carrollton-Farmers Branch district. In a lawsuit, the family said the required moment of silence violated the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment — "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion." A Sept. 22, 2008, Austin American-Statesman news article, quoted David Croft, the father, as saying: "It's clear if you watch the video and read the transcripts of the legislative debates that the main purpose of this law is to create school-sponsored silent prayer, and that with a wink and a nod they're just sort of calling it a moment of silence." A 1985 U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowed moments of silence in public schools so long as the practice is motivated by a secular purpose, the Statesman article says. In January 2008, the Statesman story says, U.S. District Judge Barbara Lynn found a nonreligious purpose for the quiet time, though she said that she had to hunt for it. "The Texas Legislature was less than clear in articulating the secular purpose of the Texas moment of silence law," Lynn ruled, according to the article. Still, the article says, Lynn was reassured by legislative debate indicating the silent time was meant to make schools "more reflective and more reverent," prepare students for the "seriousness of the day" and create "a common moment of preparation, deliberation and meditation." In 2009, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans upheld the lower court’s decision, saying the moment-of-silence law had a secular purpose. In our interview, we asked Wentworth if it’s an overstatement to say he personally restored prayer and the pledge. He replied that while he was the author of the law and led the charge, many members were involved. "All of this is a team sport," he said. "Legislation is not passed by any one member of the House or the Senate." For perspective on the impact of the Texas law on students’ right to pray, we contacted Charles Haynes, a senior scholar at the First Amendment Center in Washington. Haynes said by telephone: "Of course, state and school-sponsored prayer remain unconstitutional. (Wentworth) couldn’t possibly be restoring state-sponsored prayer. And students’ freedom to pray has never been illegal; they are free to pray alone or in groups as long as they don’t disrupt or interfere with rights of others." Our ruling Wentworth authored a measure mandating a daily chance for students to pray, though school-led or organized prayers like the ones of his youth remain unconstitutional. Also, Texas lawmakers affirmed the right of students to pray or meditate on their own nearly a decade earlier. Aside from requiring students to be quiet for a minute, the Wentworth-originated law resulted in students reciting the pledge, as his ad says, though it seems like that had was already occurring in some schools. Finally, Wentworth did not personally achieve the touted changes, though he was a key advocate. We rate his claim Half True.	None	Jeff Wentworth	None	None	None	2012-05-25T17:25:56	2012-05-09	['None']
pomt-03430	Says he can be on the ballot for Congress while serving time in jail.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jun/25/stephen-nodine/can-convicted-felon-run-congress-jail/	By day, Stephen Nodine works at a law office in Bay Minette, Ala. By night, he is an inmate at the Baldwin County Jail where he is serving a two-year sentence for perjury. This would be of little interest except Nodine says he might want to run for Congress and represent Alabama’s 1st Congressional District. Nodine notified the media of his interest last week, and in an email to PolitiFact, he said, "I can run, but it seems some party leaders don't want me to." Nodine is right that Republican officials in Alabama have not embraced his candidacy -- more on that in a bit. But we thought we should take a moment and ask, is Nodine correct when he says he can run for office? Nodine is not the first man behind bars to seek the chance to serve the public while serving time. In 2002, former Rep. James Traficant, I-Ohio, took 15 percent of the vote even though he had just started an eight-year sentence for bribery, racketeering and other crimes. Going farther back in history, Matthew Lyon was successful in 1798. He had been convicted of libel, ran for Congress from prison and won. The Constitution lists three conditions one must meet to be a candidate for the House of Representatives -- you must be at least 25 years old, have been a citizen for at least seven years and live in the state you hope to represent. These are all that are required, and states may not add to them, for example, by prohibiting a felon from running for office. According to a 2002 Congressional Research Service report, these conditions "are fixed and may not be supplemented by Congress nor by any State unilaterally." States have more leeway when it comes to setting rules for who may hold state level office, but they have none at the federal level. The Supreme Court, in a case involving term limits, made it clear that states may not interfere. In U.S. Term Limits, Inc. vs. Thornton, the court struck down an amendment to the Arkansas constitution that limited those elected to Congress to three terms in the House and two in the Senate. The court explained in its decision that not only states but even Congress itself could not "impose additional qualifications (that) would violate that ‘fundamental principle of our representative democracy . . . that the people should choose whom they please to govern them,’" according to an analysis in the Brigham Young University Law Review. So when Nodine says he can run, he’s right. But getting his name on the ballot is a different matter. The Republican primary hurdle Nodine is no stranger to politics. He was a county commissioner in Mobile County. His emailed announcement of his interest in running came with photos of him and President George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. Nodine’s fall from grace came in 2010 when he was indicted in connection with the death of a long-time mistress. In a deal with prosecutors, Nodine pleaded guilty to felony perjury, and a charge of criminally negligent homicide was dropped. He now says he had a moral failing but was "wrongfully accused." (Read an overview of the case from the Mobile Press-Register.) Nodine is an ardent Republican and should he run, he plans to compete in the GOP primary in a special election to fill the seat of Rep. Jo Bonner, R- Ala., who will resign in mid August. Nodine isn't slated for release until more than a year after that. But the Alabama Republican Party chairman, Bill Armistead, vowed that Nodine won’t get very far. "I can tell you that as chair, I see no circumstances where I would support a convicted felon being a candidate for the Republican Party," Armistead said. The state GOP has its own rules for qualifying candidates. To run as a Republican, a person must affirm, "I have not been convicted of a felony under the laws of the United States or of another state." Nodine unambiguously falls short. "This would be stopped at the time of an attempt to qualify," Armistead said. Armistead said he’s confident that the party has the right to determine who may participate in its own primary. He said when Democrats tried to run as Republicans, party leaders blocked them with no challenge. On the other hand, he said he’s never faced this exact situation before. The issue is whether a state party could exclude a person who would otherwise pass muster by federal standards. We asked a few experts in election law for their opinions, and while their views vary, Nodine clearly has his work cut out for him Richard Winger, the editor of Ballot Access News, said Nodine might well prevail should the court find that the party plays a vital role in the electoral process. "I just re-read U.S. Term Limits vs. Thornton," Winger said, "I now feel confident that the Alabama Republican Party can't exclude the candidate. The U.S. Supreme Court said that indirect attempts (to exclude) are just as unlawful as direct attempts." But Winger said Nodine can expect a fight. "There is no real clarity in the law, because obviously parties can ban candidates from their primary ballot for Congress if the candidates aren't members of the party. It's possible the Alabama state courts would let the party exclude the person, but if the person appeals to federal court I believe he will win." David Schultz, a law professor at Hamline University, said this is an area of contested law. "There is a big debate over how far parties can go in terms of governing internal affairs," Schultz said. "Could they pick their own dates for conventions, how they select their officers? Yes. But once it gets to primaries run by the state and to general elections, then the choices parties make are subject to more regulation." Schultz’s summary on whether the Alabama GOP has the legal right to block Nodine? "This is a cool issue -- right at the edge of the law." But Justin Levitt, professor at Loyola Law School, has more discouraging news for Nodine. "Nodine is right that federal law protects his right to run," Levitt said, "But it doesn't likely protect his right to run as a Republican, or even to run for the right to run as a Republican standard-bearer." So long as parties don’t discriminate in ways banned by the Constitution -- on the basis of race or religion for example -- then they can do much as they please, Levitt said. To be clear, this dispute centers on the primary, not the general election. For a general election, there are two ways to get on the ballot -- as the nominee of a party or by getting enough Alabama voters to sign a petition. Nothing would prevent Nodine from running as an independent in a general election; nothing except the need to gather the signatures of 5,938 voters who live in the 1st Congressional District, the minimum number required under Alabama law. A final irony The Constitution might affirm Nodine’s right to run for office, but it grants states broad authority over deciding who may vote. Alabama law disenfranchises anyone who is behind bars, on probation or on parole. Nodine is definitely still in jail. This leads to the potentially paradoxical situation that should he get on the ballot, he wouldn’t be able to vote for himself. Interestingly, his inability to vote also further hamstrings any plans for a primary bid. The Alabama GOP requires that a candidate declare that "I am not subject to disqualification from registering and voting." Our ruling Nodine claimed that he "can run" for office. As a legal matter, he is correct. The Constitution enshrines the idea that the people get to decide who shall represent them, and the only limits are age, citizenship and residency. In terms of federal law, Nodine can indeed run. His desire to run as a Republican puts him in murkier waters. Political parties enjoy a certain independence. The opinions of the legal experts we reached ranged from thumbs up to thumbs down on Nodine’s chances in court. But even on the more optimistic end, the court battles would be decided long after the election Nodine cares about is over. In the broadest sense, Nodine has the legal right to run for office from jail, but significant barriers lie between that right and his name appearing on the ballot. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-11603	"No private business was conducted on public property. That issue is a contract dispute."	false	/illinois/statements/2018/jan/29/bruce-rauner/how-hands-has-rauner-been-his-investments/	Details contained in a lawsuit brought against Gov. Bruce Rauner by a former business associate have called into further question the governor’s insistence that he no longer plays a role in his business investments. Appearing before the Chicago Tribune’s editorial board Monday, Rauner was asked to address an account from former associate Harreld "Kip" Kirkpatrick III describing how the two discussed the business investment on which Kirkpatrick’s case centers. "No private business was conducted on public property," Rauner told the Tribune during a mini-debate with his rival in the March Republican primary, state Rep. Jeanne Ives of Wheaton. "That issue is a contract dispute, contract dispute. It’s not an investment decision. A contract dispute that stemmed from before I was governor." Pressed on whether he spoke with Kirkpatrick at all about that dispute, the governor doubled down: "I was not doing private business on state property," he said. "It’s not an investment decision, it’s not about making investments. Not about assets." Kirkpatrick’s lawsuit was filed last October under court seal, an unusual move that kept its allegations hidden from public view. At the time, Rauner told reporters he had nothing to do with the lawsuit because he had signed "blind trust commitments" before taking office that ceded control of his investments to a New York investment house. We fact-checked that claim at the time, rating it Half True. Despite the name Rauner used, he hadn’t really set up a blind trust that would have prevented him from managing his money. Rauner instead signed a power of attorney in which the governor retained the authority to handle his investments along with the New York firm. But the issue flared again in recent days after a Cook County judge removed the lawsuit seal, revealing that Kirkpatrick claimed he and Rauner were fighting over how to divvy up a $67.5 million settlement pot involving a separate legal dispute tied to an investment both had stakes in. In the lawsuit, Kirkpatrick claimed he met twice with Rauner in 2015 to discuss their differences, including once on the back porch of the governor’s mansion in Springfield. So if Kirkpatrick’s version of events is correct, how then can Rauner claim he has been hands-off with his investments? We decided to take a closer look. A matter of (blind) trust The particulars of the investment spat between Rauner and Kirkpatrick are only peripheral to the credibility questions raised by Rauner’s actions. What is central is an action taken by Rauner just days before he assumed office in 2015 aimed at easing public concerns that his vast wealth might conflict with his actions as governor. Back then, Rauner, a multimillionaire private equity investor, announced that he had entered into "blind trust commitments" in which he authorized a New York investment house to handle his financial affairs. The move came against the backdrop of his refusal to release detailed tax records that could clearly show how his money was handled. The name Rauner gave that instrument was somewhat misleading. He did not enter into a blind trust, which would have required him to cede control over his investments to a third party. Instead, what Rauner did was sign a power of attorney in which Rauner retained the authority to manage his investments along with the New York firm. When Kirkpatrick filed his lawsuit in October, Rauner invoked his blind trust commitments to suggest the legal action, including the sealing of the court file, was not his doing and he knew little about it. We rated that Half True because the power of attorney he signed did not preclude him from involvement and, with the file sealed, there was no way to check his claim. But when the file was unsealed recently, pieces of Rauner’s story began to unravel. For instance, Rauner insisted in October that he was not behind the push to keep the case allegations sealed and out of view. But filings from Kirkpatrick’s lawyers contradict that claim. They contend that the governor invoked a confidentiality provision in a business agreement with Kirkpatrick to request that the complaint be filed under seal. What’s more, a report by The Associated Press confirmed one part of the allegations leveled by Kirkpatrick: Rauner’s state-paid scheduler had arranged a meeting between the governor and Kirkpatrick on May 11, 2015, at the executive mansion in Springfield. Rauner spokeswoman Rachel Bold did not respond directly when we reached out to the governor’s office last week to clarify whether he still denied speaking with Kirkpatrick or whether he simply disputed Kirkpatrick’s account of their meeting. "This is a contract dispute that stems from before Governor Rauner took office," she wrote in an email. "The governor is seeking to enforce the terms of that contract. Court filings dispute Mr. Kirkpatrick’s allegations, including his characterizations of any conversations." Bold added that the governor "is not involved in day-to-day investment decisions." She responded almost word-for-word again Monday when we reached out for clarification following Rauner’s remarks at the Tribune. Our ruling Rauner said, "No private business was conducted on public property." At its core, the question raised by the lawsuit against Rauner is simple to address. He has claimed from his first days as governor that he would have no involvement in managing an investment portfolio worth hundreds of millions of dollars to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest. Kirkpatrick’s lawsuit contends Rauner violated that pledge. In defending himself, Rauner has appeared evasive and is now attempting to parse the difference between personal involvement with an investment and personal involvement with a contract dispute stemming from an investment. It is a distinction without a difference. Rauner is being disingenuous and obtuse, and we rate his statement as False.	None	Bruce Rauner	None	None	None	2018-01-29T19:00:00	2018-01-29	['None']
pomt-00553	Says Scott Walker runs a state government that bans "employees from talking about climate change."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jun/16/forecast-facts/group-says-scott-walker-bans-employees-talking-abo/	If a website from a progressive group is to be believed, state workers in Wisconsin cannot even say the words "climate change." So the scottaway.com website, developed by an operation called Forecast the Facts, allows readers to click a red button on the screen and get alternative words to use, like "weather roulette" and "extended Popsicle season." One tongue-in-cheek offering: "In the U.S., FREE OUTDOOR HEATING is predicted to cause more heat waves, flooding, wildfires, sea level rise and drought." Forecast the Facts, a project of the progressive Citizen Engagement Laboratory, says it developed the website in response to government denial of climate change. "Governors Rick Scott (FL) and Scott Walker (WI) both run state governments that ban employees from talking about climate change," the group said on the site. Scott’s administration is reported to have an unofficial policy banning employees at the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and other agencies, from using "climate change" or "global warming" in official communications. But we are interested here in Wisconsin and Walker, who is a top GOP presidential contender. Are state government employees in Wisconsin banned from talking about climate change? The genesis of the claim In April, we rated True a claim by the group NextGen Climate that Tia Nelson, executive secretary of the Board of Commissioners of Public Lands, was prohibited from talking about global warming while on state time. The board manages state lands and a trust that funds school libraries and makes loans to school districts. The board employs 10 full-time staff members. On April 7, the board voted 2-1 to approve a resolution that banned its staff from "engaging in global warming or climate change work while on BCPL time." The resolution grew out of concerns that Nelson had spent time advocating for climate change policies as part of her role as co-chair of Gov. Jim Doyle’s now disbanded task force on global warming. The board is to vote Tuesday June 16, 2015, on a measure that would change the ban from "engaging in global warming or climate change work" to engaging in "policy advocacy" on the board’s time. About the board But Walker is not on the board. Its members, as defined by the state constitution, are three other statewide elected officials -- Attorney General Brad Schimel and state Treasurer Matt Adamczyk, both Republicans, and Secretary of State Doug LaFollette, a Democrat. Thus, the board is not even part of the executive branch. Its 10 employees represent about .0003 percent of the state’s about 30,000 total employees. Cullen Werwie, communications director for the state Department of Administration, said no cabinet agency under Walker had such a ban. And we could not find any such evidence either. On the flip side, we did find examples of government engaging in conversation about climate change -- such as on the Department of Natural Resources’ web page, which talks about climate change and the Great Lakes, and the Department of Transportation documents related to its long-term transportation plan. A search for the terms "climate change" or "global warming" on wisconsin.gov sites yielded more than 1,000 results. A tenuous connection When we asked Forecast the Facts for back up to its claim, it sent an audio recording of the Board of Commissioners of Public Lands meeting and vote. But that board, of course, is separate from Walker. And the group’s claim was broader, referring generally to state government employees, not just those in one department. Brant Olson, the campaign director for the group, could not name any other part of state government with such as ban in place. Instead, the group cited a quote from Laurel Patrick, the governor’s spokeswoman, in a New York Times article about the board’s ban: "Generally, Governor Walker does not think it is unreasonable to enact policies requiring board staff to focus on board-related activities." Olson said the quote showed the climate change ban was "clearly a decision he endorses." While we were reporting this item, though, the group swapped in some new words. The language on the web site was changed to read: "Governors Rick Scott (FL) and Scott Walker (WI) both support state agencies that reportedly ban employees from talking about climate change." Even that could be outdated if the public lands board passes the measure to amend its rule. Our rating Forecast the Facts said Walker runs a state government that bans "employees from talking about climate change." But the group could only name one obscure agency, outside of the governor's jurisdiction, that has such a rule in place. The rule was aimed at barring its workers from doing climate-change work while on state time. And that rule is poised to be amended. Meanwhile, we found plenty of examples where state agencies were discussing climate change. We rate the claim False.	None	Forecast the Facts	None	None	None	2015-06-16T05:00:00	2015-06-02	['None']
pomt-14800	"The world food demand is going to double sometime between now and 2070."	true	/missouri/statements/2015/nov/30/roy-blunt/sen-roy-blunt-right-about-future-demand-food/	U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican, attended the 2015 Missouri State Fair on Aug. 20 in Sedalia and won the support of agricultural associations, while opposing government regulations on agriculture. Surrounded by agricultural organization leaders, Blunt opposed the EPA’s proposed Clean Power Plan. "The world food demand is going to double sometime between now and 2070. Nobody is better prepared to take advantage of that than we are, unless we let the regulators get in the way," Blunt said. We thought his estimation of the growth in demand sounded like an extreme claim and wanted to see the research. World food demand David Tilman is an author of the article "Global food demand and the sustainable intensification of agriculture," and regents professor of ecology at the University of Minnesota. He’s conducted research focused on global food consumption and its effects. "The senator is correct," Tilman said, "Globally, increasing incomes and population mean that we likely will need to double the global production of crops within the next 40 to 50 years" Projections from the United Nations, Food and Agriculture Organization, the University of Minnesota and many other researchers have found that world food demand, or the amount in which food production must increase, will double by sometime between 2050 and 2070. Why the growth? Global population is going to grow to almost 9.6 billion by 2050, and more than half of this is expected to occur in Sub-Saharan Africa, where one-quarter of the population is undernourished. Globally, income and urbanization has been growing rapidly for the past five decades, and with that comes increased demand for food and a change in diets. Global gross domestic production is projected to continue to grow at about 2.9 percent every year, with the most drastic changes occurring in developing countries. Researchers, including Tilman, have found that calorie and protein consumption is directly related to per capita GDP. In 2000, the richest countries were consuming 256 percent more calories and 430 percent more protein than the world's poorest nations. So as global GDP grows, as does population, so will the demand for world food. Also a steady increase in global income often leads to a change in diet. China’s long-growing increase in meat consumption, for example, is a result of increased income and is a trend observed throughout other developing nations. Population and diet change alone will cause a 69 percent increase in calorie demand by 2050, researchers say. Our ruling Blunt said, "The world food demand is going to double sometime between now and 2070." The scientific community agrees. We rate this claim to be True.

pomt-04683	Says House Republicans "tried to change the definition of rape."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/sep/06/gwen-moore/gop-house-members-tried-redefine-rape-democratic-r/	U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore of Wisconsin was among women members of the House who made brief speeches Sept. 4, 2012, at the Democratic National Convention. Moore said she is working to end violence against women, then blasted her Republican colleagues, declaring: "No victim of domestic violence or bullying -- man or woman -- should feel unprotected in America. Yet when Democrats acted to strengthen the Violence Against Women Act, Republicans in the House moved to weaken it. In other legislation, they have even tried to change the definition of rape." Let’s hit the pause button. Did House Republicans try to redefine what constitutes rape and, as the claim suggests, thus affect what would put a perpetrator in prison? Definition evolves We'll begin by noting that the definition of rape has not been constant. The "legal definition of rape has evolved over centuries, and clearly, we’re not done fighting over it," Stanford University historian Estelle Freedman wrote in The Washington Post a couple of weeks before Moore’s speech. She noted that in the 1980s, for example, states began to outlaw marital rape. In October 2011, PolitiFact National rated as Half True a claim by Vice President Joe Biden that murder and rape in Flint, Mich., increased after the police force in that city was reduced. Our colleagues noted that the FBI’s definition of rape -- "the carnal knowledge of a female, forcibly and against her will" -- was particularly limited when compared to the definition of other law enforcement agencies, in that it excluded male victims and other types of sexual assaults. Three months later, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting definition of rape was being revised to be more inclusive and to better reflect state codes. Noting that the previous definition of rape had been in place since 1927, he said the new definition is: "The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim." Moore’s claim To back Moore’s claim, Moore spokeswoman Nicole Williams cited two pieces of legislation relating to federal funding for abortions. So, although Moore’s statement was broad -- House Republicans "tried to change the definition of rape" -- what she cites as evidence is much narrower, having to do with how rape is defined when federal money is used to pay for abortions. 1. No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act Williams cited an August 2012 article in Mother Jones, a liberal magazine, on legislation regarding federal funding of abortions in cases of rape. The article said the bill was co-sponsored by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, Republican Mitt Romney’s vice-presidential running mate, and GOP U.S. Rep. Todd Akin of Missouri. (Akin, a U.S. Senate candidate, was denounced for saying in August 2012 that pregnancies are rare in cases of "legitimate rape." He apologized but resisted calls to drop out of the race.) Ryan and Akin were among the co-sponsors of the legislation, which would have limited federal funding of abortions to victims of "forcible" rape and certain other circumstances, PolitiFact New Jersey found in rating a claim by New Jersey Democratic Party chairman John Wisniewski as True. PolitiFact New Jersey found that the legislation, sponsored by Rep. Chris Smith, R-New Jersey, was first introduced in July 2010. With Democrats controlling the House, the bill didn't move forward. In January 2011, after Republicans won a majority in the House, Smith reintroduced the legislation. Ryan and Akin -- along with 225 other mostly Republican House members -- again co-sponsored it. The Boston Globe reported that the bill narrowed an exemption to the Hyde Amendment, which allows federal dollars to be used for abortions in cases of rape and incest. Smith’s bill would have limited the incest exemption to minors and covered only victims of "forcible rape." House Republicans never defined what constituted "forcible rape" and what did not, the Globe said, but the term "forcible rape" ignited an outcry among various critics, who said the phrase would exclude victims rapes involving drugs and victims of statutory rape. Statutory rape occurs when an individual, regardless of age, has consensual sexual relations with an individual not old enough to legally consent. Smith dropped the forcible rape term from the bill. The revised bill passed the House, but the Democrat-controlled Senate never voted on it. When Ryan was asked by Fox News in August 2012 about why he sought the forcible rape language, he said the bills were aimed at stopping taxpayer funding of abortion and that "forcible rape" was "stock language" used in various bills. He said he agreed with it being removed from the legislation he supported, but didn’t elaborate on what he meant by stock language. Among those coming to Ryan’s defense was The Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine. It noted, as other media have, that the intent of the word forcible was to prevent taxpayer-funding of abortions in the case of statutory rape, such as when a 16-year-old and a 19-year-old have consensual sex. PolitiFact Texas reached a similar conclusion in September 2012 when it rated as Half True a claim by a pro-Democratic political action committee that Ryan, Akin and Texas House Republicans backed a bill to distinguish between rape and forcible rape. According to the text of the 2010 and 2011 bills and numerous news stories, our colleagues said, "the main purpose of the legislation was not redefining rape but limiting the use of federal funds to pay for abortion." 2. Protect Life Act Moore’s spokeswoman also cited the Protect Life Act, saying it also would have restricted to forcible rape the exceptions for when federal funding can be used for abortions. The January 2011 bill, which passed the House but didn’t become law, would have amended President Barack Obama’s health care reform law to prevent federal payment to health plans that include abortion coverage, according to PolitiFact National. Our rating Moore said House Republicans "tried to change the definition of rape." Her statement contains an element of truth, in that GOP members sought to change when federal money for abortions could be used in cases of rape, by using the term "forcible rape." But the claim ignores critical facts that would give a different impression -- the House Republicans’ effort was not to change the definition of rape, per se, but rather to restrict the use of federal funds in abortions. We rate Moore’s statement Mostly False.	None	Gwen Moore	None	None	None	2012-09-06T14:32:44	2012-09-04	['None']
pomt-13648	Through the Clinton Foundation, "the Clintons are now worth in excess of $100 million."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/07/america-rising-now/pro-trump-super-pac-ad-wrong-clinton-wealth/	A super PAC backing Donald Trump, Rebuilding America Now, released a new ad attacking Hillary Clinton. It’s running in the battleground states of Ohio, North Carolina and Florida, and it hits both Hillary and Bill Clinton on their personal finances. The ad, which PAC chairman and Florida Gov. Rick Scott unveiled on NBC’s Meet the Press, opens with a clip of Hillary Clinton saying that when she and Bill left the White House, they were dead broke (a claim we rated Mostly False). As the logo of the Clinton Foundation appears on the screen, the narration begins. "A foundation was created, and money started to roll. Speeches, connections and donations. Misogynistic regimes, Wall Street insiders, corrupt dictators. They all had one thing in common: Their check cleared. The Clintons are now worth in excess of $100 million." Anyone watching the ad would get the sense that somehow through the Clinton Foundation, the Clintons amassed a net worth of over $100 million in about 15 years. That’s misleading, for a few reasons. Let’s start with the $100 million-plus in net worth. We reached out to the super PAC, through its website and with an email to one of the Republican strategists behind it, to get its sources and did not hear back. The ad itself points to something published in Fortune on Feb. 2, 2015. We couldn’t find a matching article. We did find a later article from September 2015 in Fortune that estimated Hillary Clinton’s net worth at about $30 million. In October 2015, Forbes wrote, "After layering years of disclosures on top of annual tax returns, Forbes estimates their combined net worth at $45 million." The most current estimate comes from Hillary Clinton’s federal financial disclosure filing, something she had to provide as a presidential candidate. That form states explicitly that the assets of both the candidate and his or her spouse must be included. The values are reported in ranges. On the low end, the Clintons reported assets of $11.3 million. On the high end, they might have as much as $52.7 million. The couple listed no liabilities. Kathleen Clark, a specialist in government ethics law at Washington University in St. Louis, said the only significant item those forms don’t include is real estate. "You don’t need to report the value of the home you live in," Clark said. "And that goes for a second home, too. So long as you don’t rent it out for income." The Clinton’s own two homes, one in New York and one in Washington, D.C. Together they are worth about $9 million. When we add it up, the highest amount we could find is about $62 million. The Clintons have done very well. Between multi-million dollar book contracts and speaking fees of $225,000 or more, they have earned an estimated $230 million in the 15 years since they left the White House. But income is not wealth. As high as those earnings are, that still doesn’t bring them close to the $100 million mark, much less take them beyond it. We found several articles that said Bill Clinton has a net worth of $80 million, but none said how they got that number. By law, his assets must also be disclosed on his wife’s federal filing. The ad’s claim about the role of the Clinton Foundation is suggestive but unclear. The foundation has grown rapidly, raising over $2 billion to fight AIDS, reduce hunger and poverty, and rein in climate change. It has received millions from several Middle Eastern kingdoms, mega-wealthy businessmen and major corporations. The ad doesn’t say how that money translates into cash for the Clintons. In point of fact, according to the foundation’s tax filings and its website, none of the Clintons are paid by the foundation. Our ruling The super PAC Rebuilding America Now, a pro-Trump entity, said that the Clintons built a net worth of over $100 million after creating the Clinton Foundation. While some unsourced articles have used that number, official documents and the assessments of other, more rigorous reports show a net worth between $11 million and about $53 million. Even after accounting for the value of their two homes, the highest figure we found was $62 million. There is no evidence that money given to the Clinton Foundation has made its way into the Clintons’ pockets. The Clintons have become wealthy since its creation, but the ad hints darkly at shady dealings without proof. The statement twists a grain of truth to paint a misleading picture. We rate this statement Mostly False. Editor's note: After we published, the Super PAC Rebuildng America Now sent us their supporting material on wealthy donors to the Clinton Foundation, speaking fees, and a corrected link to an article citing the Clintons' net worth. That article stated the amount as an estimate without any source provided. The fact-check and rating remain unchanged. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9b3c130e-a1a9-4ec6-b341-3af704b071d7	None	Rebuilding America Now	None	None	None	2016-08-07T17:24:25	2016-08-07	['Bill_Clinton', 'Clinton_Foundation']
pomt-04366	"Now remember, property taxes went up 70 percent in the 10 years before I became governor."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/oct/22/chris-christie/chris-christie-says-property-taxes-jumped-70-perce/	Whether on the national stage or back home in New Jersey, Gov. Chris Christie often peppers the crowd with statistics while describing the fiscal woes of New Jersey before he took office. Among his arsenal of numbers is the rate of increase in the state’s property tax bills. At an Oct. 16 town hall meeting in West Milford, Christie unsheathed that figure as he said his reforms are constraining property taxes. "We're announcing $116 million dollars today in additional savings to local governments statewide. Here's why. The savings are possible because of the reforms we put in place: 2 percent cap on property taxes. The property tax rates are starting to come in from across the state. They came in from Burlington County the other day, 1.7 percent increase countywide in property taxes. The cap's working," he said. "Now remember, property taxes went up 70 percent in the 10 years before I became governor. So you’re having [a] 7 percent a year average." Did New Jersey’s property taxes -- the nation’s highest -- jump by 70 percent in a decade? Homeowners may not be surprised to learn that the increase was actually slightly more. Though, when property tax rebates are factored in, the increase is roughly 50 percent. Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak said in an e-mail that the governor’s statement is "unequivocally true and a glaring illustration of the uncontrolled rise in property taxes in the decade before we arrived in Trenton -- caused by unrestrained spending and overgenerous benefits and the expansion of government at the local and state level." The average property tax bill in New Jersey was roughly $4,240 in 1999, according to data from the state Department of Community Affairs. By 2009 -- the year before Christie took office -- the average property tax bill had climbed to about $7,280. That’s a more than 71 percent increase. But there’s also another chapter to the story of New Jersey’s property taxes: rebates. In previous fact-checks, experts told us reductions in property tax rebate programs could be viewed as tax hikes, since they’re intended to reduce the property tax burden of homeowners. In 1999, when the NJ Saver program was started under former Gov. Christie Whitman the average rebate check mailed to homeowners was $111. By 2009, the average rebate was $1,037. When you deduct those rebates from the average property tax bill, the increase over the decade before Christie took office is less than 70 percent. In 1999, homeowners paid an average of about $4,130 in property taxes, with the rebate. In 2009, that figure jumped to roughly $6,240, an increase of more than 51 percent. It’s worth noting Christie stopped delivering checks for property tax relief during his first year in office and changed the program so the rebates came as a credit deducted off property tax bills. In 2011, the average property tax bill was $7,759. With the credit, the average bill was $7,519. Our ruling Christie said: "property taxes went up 70 percent in the 10 years before I became governor." In the decade before Christie took office, the average property tax bill climbed more than 70 percent, from roughly $4,240 to about $7,280. But when property tax rebates are taken into account, the increase is less, jumping roughly 50 percent in a decade. Either way, Christie is on point that property taxes increased significantly from 1999 to 2009. We rate this statement Mostly True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-14929	"Most Americans are now getting their news from Facebook."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/oct/29/rebecca-kleefisch/most-people-get-their-news-facebook-gop-wisconsin-/	Republican Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch was asked at a Marquette University Law School forum why polls indicate that most Wisconsin residents think the state is headed in the wrong direction. Kleefisch told the audience Oct. 21, 2015 that she thought the polls reflected Wisconsinites’ concerns about where the nation is headed. Then she suggested that some of the good economic news in the state isn’t getting enough attention -- and made an interesting claim about Facebook, saying: "One of the things that we don’t hear a lot about is the fact that wages are actually up four and a half percent year over year here in Wisconsin. I haven’t read that article. I read it in my briefing binder; we hear our cabinet secretaries talk about it. But it’s not one of those things that’s on Facebook every day. Most Americans are now getting their news from Facebook. We need to be talking about the things that matter to our neighbors." When we asked Kleefisch about the Facebook claim, she said "should have qualified and sourced" what she stated. She said she was actually relying on a poll about where millennials get their news about politics and government, not where all Americans get their news generally. But let’s investigate this a little, looking at some scientific polls. The polls The poll Kleefisch said she relied on was reported in June 2015 by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center. That survey, done in March and April of 2014, found that most millennials -- 61 percent -- reported getting news about politics and government from Facebook in the previous week. Millennials were born from 1981 to 1996, and were between the ages of 18 and 33 at the time. We found some other polling, however, that surveyed for all Americans and for news generally, not just news about politics and government. Those polls do not show that most Americans get news from Facebook. 1. A March 2015 Pew poll found that 41 percent of American adults get news from Facebook. Pew emphasized to us that that does not suggest that Facebook is the main source of news for that group. 2. A poll done for the American Press Institute in January and February 2014 asked respondents if they had found news in the previous week from a list of various sources that were read to them. When asked if they got news directly from news organizations, such as a newspaper or TV newscast, websites or news wires, 88 percent said yes. Only 44 percent said they had gotten news in the past week from social media, through platforms such as Twitter or Facebook. 3. Gallup in June 2013 used an open-ended question to ask respondents to identify their main source of news. Some 55 percent of the respondents said TV; that was the most popular answer. Only 21 percent said the Internet as their main news source, including 2 percent who identified Facebook, Twitter or other social media. Nine percent said the print version of newspapers. Tom Rosenstiel, executive director of the American Press Institute, told us there are two points to keep in mind: Overall, most Americans get their news from many sources, even if TV still is the most common, and people use different sources for different types of news. "We seek it out and we bump into it and, actually, no one place dominates," he said. Facebook is not a source of news -- since it distributes rather than produces news -- but it is likely the top pathway to news for people under age 35. Our rating Kleefisch said at a public forum: "Most Americans are now getting their news from Facebook." The lieutenant governor told us she misspoke and should have qualified her statement to make it about millennials -- Americans roughly between the ages of 18 and 33. One poll found that 61 percent of them reported getting political news on Facebook in the previous week. But in terms of Americans overall getting news of all types, not just political news, we found no polls indicating that a majority get news from Facebook. We rate Kleefisch’s statement False. More on polling U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Wis., said "60 percent of all Americans do not want to see Planned Parenthood defunded." True. GOP presidential candidate Ben Carson said the number of people who "believe in socialism ... is increasing." Half True. Conservative commentator Karl Rove said that at this point in 2012, "Rick Perry was ahead at 29.9 percent, and we had seven more leads before it finally settled on Mitt Romney." Mostly True.

pomt-04433	"Tennessee students now cover about 67 percent of the cost of their education at public universities, and some 60 percent at community colleges."	true	/tennessee/statements/2012/oct/13/john-g-morgan/official-says-students-not-state-paying-most-colle/	It’s well known that college tuition, at both public and private schools, has risen rapidly over the past several years. The steep increases have occurred across the nation, and Tennessee’s public institutions are no different, largely as a result of declining state appropriations But when John Morgan, chancellor of the Tennessee Board of Regents, told a U.S. Senate committeethat Tennessee students now pay 67 percent of the costs of their educations at the state’s universities and 60 percent at community colleges, we were curious. When many parents of today’s students were public college students themselves two, three or four decades ago, the ratio was the reverse: state appropriations comprised up to 70 percent of the costs, and students and their parents picked up the rest. Did the burden shift that much? In a word, yes. Morgan was precisely on mark with his testimony, as expected from a higher education administrator who spent 10 years as state comptroller, state government’s chief auditor and financial watchdog. The latest figures available from the Tennessee Higher Education Commission, for the 2011-12 school year, show that student tuition and fees comprised 67 percent of the sum of revenue that state universities receive from state appropriations and from tuition and fees, and 60 percent at the community colleges. TheTHEC Fact Bookfor 2011-12, which is full of interesting information about public higher education in Tennessee, is available for review onTHEC’s website. It’s important to note that those figures do NOT include what students pay for meal plans, residence halls and books and supplies – expenses that are not subsidized by taxpayers and which can be triple the costs of tuition at public schools. When those costs are included, students and parents are paying far more than two-thirds of the total costs of attending public institutions. But Morgan was discussing only tuition and mandatory fees. Students’ share of the costs has been steadily rising while the state’s share has been declining. Through the mid-1980s, the state paid about 70 percent of what its public colleges and universities cost on a per-student basis. But that share has been decreasing ever since, through both Democratic and Republican control of the state Capitol. By 2000, the state share had declined to 57 percent at its universities and 68 percent at its community colleges. By the 2011-12 school year, the state share was down to about one-third at the universities and to 40 percent at the community colleges. The tipping point when Tennessee students began paying more of the costs than taxpayers occurred in 2003 at the four-year schools and in 2009 at the two-year campuses, THEC says. When contacted for this article, Morgan said that "even with the rise in tuition over the last five years or so, on a per full-time equivalent basis, our institutions have less money to spend than they did five or so years ago," at least through last year. "State reductions, along with a rise in enrollments, have forced us to become more efficient in a way," Morgan said. He added:"Whatever the case, I believe we are at a point where we can’t raise tuition much beyond general-inflation increases without impacting enrollment. We may already be seeing that effect this year: enrollment is down on average across our system although historically enrollments rise during recessions and flatten out or decline somewhat during recoveries. From a public policy standpoint, if Tennessee’s future is dependent on increasing education attainment, we are going to have to find a way to make it affordable. I’m hopeful that is a conversation we have as a state this year." Gov. Bill Haslam is focusing on higher education this year, although much of his work thus far has been on ensuring that public institutions produce graduates with skills to enter the state’s workforce. So far at least, about his only talk of affordability has been a promise to try to increase state funding and efficiencies on public campuses, which would reduce the pressures to raise tuition. It will be interesting to see how much influence Morgan, who has spent most of his career helping inform the public policy of the state, will have on that discussion. Our ruling Parents of aspiring college students who remember the days when tuition covered just one-third the per-student costs at state colleges and universities may be shocked to learn that, at least in Tennessee, students now pay 67 percent of the costs of their education through tuition and fees. That’s the point that one of Tennessee’s top higher education officials told a Senate committee, and the research backs him up. We rule this statement True.	None	John G.

pomt-14831	"8 Syrians caught at Texas border in Laredo."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2015/nov/20/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-claims-syrians-caught-mexico-border-re/	Gov. Greg Abbott, at the forefront of a push-back by more than half the nation's governors against the U.S. admitting Syrian refugees, declared that fresh apprehensions at the Texas-Mexico border illuminate his concerns. In a Nov. 18, 2015, Twitter post, the Texas Republican said: "THIS is why Texas is vigilant about Syrian refugees." His tweet pointed to a headline on a story posted that night by the conservative Breitbart.com: "8 Syrians caught at Texas border in Laredo." Refugees from Syria -- where four years of civil war has displaced millions of people, according to the United Nations -- have been a hot topic of late. On Nov. 16, 2015, Abbott was among what proved to be 31 of the nation's governors declaring refusals to admit Syrian refugees to their states, for fear militants would mix in. That followed unsubstantiated reports that Syrians were involved in the Paris massacre that killed more than 130 people in Paris Nov. 13, 2015. Such reports were based on the discovery of a Syrian passport near the body of an attacker, which The Washington Post reported Nov. 17, 2015 was not authentic. Worth noting too, Republican officials in Texas have occasionally expressed concern that ISIS -- the terrorist militia waging war in Syria and Iraq -- could send members over the Texas border to attack the United States. When we checked, those fears were based on false assertions, like that ISIS was operating a base in Mexico, Border Patrol caught ISIS members, or that Muslim prayer rugs were found on the Texas border. But the morning after Abbott weighed in, the Republican chairman of the U.S. House Homeland Security Committee, Rep. Mike McCaul of Texas, took to TV to say there was no need for worry. Still, we wondered: Could it be that Syrian insurgents were snagged at the Rio Grande? Abbott’s source Abbott spokesman John Wittman declined to comment when asked about how the governor reached his conclusion or if the governor believed the described Syrians posed a security threat. Wittman also didn’t say if Abbott had relied on sources aside from the Breitbart story he noted in his tweet. Breitbart’s story, headlined "Exclusive--Confirmed: 8 Syrians caught at Texas border in Laredo," cited two individuals described as federal agents but not identified in the story who reportedly advised that "eight Syrian illegal aliens attempted to enter Texas from Mexico in the Laredo sector" on Monday, Nov. 16, 2015, two days before Abbott posted his tweet. The story further quoted Hector Garza, a Border Patrol agent and president of a South Texas chapter of the National Border Patrol Council, the union representing Border Patrol personnel. According to the post, Garza said agents in the Laredo area were "concerned" because they had "heard about Syrians being apprehended in the area from other federal agents," although he also said he couldn’t confirm that Syrians had lately been apprehended. By email Nov. 20, 2015, Garza told us he couldn't comment because he was on patrol. In an email, Brandon Darby, editor of Breitbart Texas and the lead reporter on the story, said his sources used the word "caught" because they said the Syrians "only acknowledged being Syrian after they were called out." Darby also noted that "caught" has a "plethora of acceptable definitions," which he supplied via email, though he declined to specify which he had intended to convey. Federal narrative We asked key federal agencies for their takes on the reported detentions. In an emailed statement responding to our query, the Department of Homeland Security, the umbrella agency for Border Patrol, said two Syrian families presented themselves at the Laredo port of entry and were taken into custody for further processing. "Please emphasize that they PRESENTED themselves," the statement said. We also touched base with the Texas Department of Public Safety, which previously doused speculation about terrorists crossing the border in October 2014. Spokesman Tom Vinger, by email, referred us to the Border Patrol. Meantime, Rick Pauza, a Border Patrol spokesman at the Laredo point of entry, said by phone the eight Syrians described in the Breitbart report "identified themselves truthfully" and did not evade agents. Darby, informed of this response, told us by email, "CBP, unfortunately, has a history of being deceptive with the public." He also pointed out a June 2014 article he authored for Breitbart titled "Customs and Border Protection agency caught lying to public." The morning after Abbott posted his tweet, McCaul discussed reports of the Syrians in Laredo on MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell Reports. "It was a Syrian refugee family that went to the Laredo port of entry in my state and basically turned themselves in for political asylum," McCaul said, meaning they were seeking shelter from imminent harm in their home country. "They were not infiltrating to conduct terrorist operations." Appropriate border crossing procedures If Syrians were looking for asylum, was walking to the border a reasonable way to do it? Mana Yegani, a Houston immigration lawyer, told us by phone that one way of seeking asylum is to appear at a port of entry. "This is very common," Yegani said. "That’s the way you seek refuge. You cross the border and walk to a border patrol agent." Typically, she said, after asylum-seekers present themselves to agents, they are sent to detention centers and interviewed by federal asylum officers, who evaluate their cases for admittance to the United States. The process usually takes three to six months, she said. The website for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services directs asylum seekers on how to proceed. "STEP ONE: Arrive in the U.S.," it says. We asked Homeland Security if any Syrians had sought asylum in the U.S. before. A spokesperson pointed us to fiscal year 2013 data--the most recent available--which showed that 811 Syrians were granted asylum during that period, up from 364 in 2012 and 60 in 2011, the year the Syrian civil war began. In all, 3.2 percent of the 25,199 asylum-seekers welcomed by the United States were Syrian in 2013. It’s rare for a Syrian to cross the border lacking required papers, other statistics suggest. According to a September 2014 report by Homeland Security, 72 of the 662,483 "aliens apprehended" by the government in the fiscal year through September 2013 were Syrian citizens--up from 57 the year before, down from 114 two years earlier. In the fiscal year through September 2014, U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement reported removing nine Syrians from the U.S.--compared to, say, nearly 177,000 people from Mexico and more than 120,000 individuals from Central America. Possible factors So there might not be many Syrians approaching Laredo. We wondered why Syrians would try to enter that way regardless. Joshua Landis, president of the Syrian Studies Association and director of the Center for Middle East Studies, said by phone there was no reason to be surprised by Syrian asylum seekers. "The amount of destruction in their country is just stupefying," he said. A four-year-long civil war between government forces and various rebel groups, including ISIS, has intensified in recent months with bombing campaigns by the United States, Russia, Jordan, France, Saudi Arabia and others, leaving much of the country in shambles. According to an Oct. 27, 2015, report by the United Nations, the conflict has left 13.5 million people, including 6 million children, in need of protection and aid. Landis said half the homes in Syria had been destroyed, while 30 percent of schools remain operational and electricity and clean water are scarce commodities. Our ruling Abbott tweeted that Syrians were "caught" by federal agents at the border in Laredo which, he said, explains why "Texas is vigilant about Syrian refugees." His implication was that the potential terrorists were trying to infiltrate Texas, giving fuel to his decision to tell the federal government the state intended not to accept Syrian refugees. Eight Syrians were taken into custody at the port of Laredo, we confirmed. But Homeland Security officials said the Syrians had turned themselves in to a Border Patrol agent, seeking asylum. So, Abbott's statement has an element of truth -- Syrians landed in U.S. custody -- but it leaves an incorrect implication of how and why they got there. We rate the claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-10362	McCain tells of a fellow Vietnam POW who was beaten for fashioning an American flag that became an inspirational symbol to fellow POWs.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/02/chain-email/fellow-pow-backs-up-mccains-story/	A chain e-mail making the rounds recounts a moving anecdote Sen. John McCain has related about a fellow Vietnam prisoner of war who was severely beaten by guards for fashioning a makeshift American flag that became an inspirational symbol to fellow POWs. The e-mail message encourages those who receive the e-mail to "pass this on... and on... and on!" And it leaves little doubt about its political intent, as it closes with the line, "oh...and then you have this clown, who refuses to place his hand on his heart and say the pledge. ..." This is an obvious, and misguided, swipe at Sen. Barack Obama, who has frequently been attacked in chain e-mails for allegedly refusing to place his hand on his heart when saying the Pledge of Allegiance. We at PolitiFact already debunked that myth. But here we will check the accuracy of McCain's POW anecdote, which was forwarded to us by several PolitiFact readers. Here's how the chain e-mail reads, in part: "One of the men who moved into my (POW) room was a young man named Mike Christian. ... Mike got himself a bamboo needle. Over a period of a couple of months, he created an American flag and sewed on the inside of his shirt. "Every afternoon, before we had a bowl of soup, we would hang Mike's shirt on the wall of the cell and say the Pledge of Allegiance. "I know the Pledge of Allegiance may not seem the most important part of our day now, but I can assure you that in that stark cell it was indeed the most important and meaningful event. "One day the Vietnamese searched our cell, as they did periodically, and discovered Mike's shirt with the flag sewn inside, and removed it. "That evening they returned, opened the door of the cell, and for the benefit of all of us, beat Mike Christian severely for the next couple of hours. Then, they opened the door of the cell and threw him in. We cleaned him up as well as we could. "The cell in which we lived had a concrete slab in the middle on which we slept. Four naked light bulbs hung in each corner of the room. "As I said, we tried to clean up Mike as well as we could. After the excitement died down, I looked in the corner of the room, and sitting there beneath that dim light bulb with a piece of red cloth, another shirt and his bamboo needle, was my friend, Mike Christian. He was sitting there with his eyes almost shut from the beating he had received, making another American flag. He was not making the flag because it made Mike Christian feel better. He was making that flag because he knew how important it was to us to be able to pledge our allegiance to our flag and country. "So the next time you say the Pledge of Allegiance, you must never forget the sacrifice and courage that thousands of Americans have made to build our nation and promote freedom around the world. You must remember our duty, our honor, and our country." McCain relates this same anecdote in his book, Faith of My Fathers, in nearly identical fashion. And the story is backed up by another POW, Leo K. Thorsness, albeit with a couple small differences in detail. Thorsness was an Air Force fighter pilot who was shot down on his 93rd mission and spent six years as a prisoner of war in Hanoi. When people ask if he lived with McCain at the Hanoi Hilton, Thorsness likes to correct: "John lived with me. I got there first." Thorsness, who was awarded the Medal of Honor for valor in the Vietnam War, recalled to PolitiFact "the day when Mike Christian found this slimy old rag, an old dirty handkerchief" while in the yard outside the cell. Thorsness said Christian spent days cleaning up the handkerchief, and used blue ink and ground up red roof tiles for color. Then, he took threads from his blanket and sewed on stars with a bamboo needle. It took a good bit of imagination to make out that it was an American flag, Thorsness said, "but we all knew what it was." When Christian finished the flag and showed it to his fellow POWs, Thorsness said, "I think every one of us snapped to attention." It was a tough group of men, he said, and yet there were very few dry eyes. Sometimes, he said, it was hung up on a cell wall and men would salute it and say the Pledge of Allegiance. "To everyone there, it was very meaningful," he said. Christian knew full well that he would eventually be caught and punished, Thorsness said. Christian hid the makeshift flag in an extra sleeve of his pajamas. But it was discovered by the guards and confiscated during a surprise inspection. That night, the guards came for Christian, Thorsness said, and "they beat him mercilessly through most of the night. They beat the hell out of him. But Mike was one tough guy." And soon after, Thorsness said, Christian was back at it again making another flag. "Anyone who witnessed that was moved," Thorsness said. "It made a lasting impression." Christian died in a Virginia home fire in 1983. Thorsness was later elected to the state Senate in Washington in 1988. During a flag amendment debate, Thorsness spoke publicly for the first time about Mike Christian's flag. "Every other senator turned their heads and looked at me," Thorsness said. The story was later published in 1992 in Reader's Digest. Several details in Thorsness' account differ from McCain's recollection, such as whether the handkerchief was a rag found in the prison yard or, as McCain tells it, part of a care package allowed in by the guards. But the stories are substantially the same. We rule McCain's story True.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2008-07-02T00:00:00	2008-05-18	['United_States', 'Prisoner_of_war', 'John_McCain']
pomt-02560	"The extra point is almost automatic. … (The NFL) had five missed extra points this year out of 1,200 some odd" attempts.	true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jan/31/roger-goodell/nfls-goodell-extra-point-almost-automatic/	An NFL.com host recently derided the extra point as the "penny" play of professional football. The smaller but surer choice of a team’s post-touchdown scoring options, it’s just kind of there. Some think it serves little purpose than being the perfect opportunity to run for the fridge or restroom. What’s an NFL exec to do to keep the game spicy and folks glued to their seats? One idea is to spike the extra point. "The extra point is almost automatic," NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said in a recent interview on NFL.com. "I believe we had five missed extra points this year out of 1,200 some odd (attempts). So it's a very small fraction of the play, and you want to add excitement with every play." Goodell mentioned a proposal that would replace the kicked PAT (point after touchdown) and award teams an automatic seven points for a touchdown instead. Then, a coach could gamble by going for an extra point with a run or pass play in the end zone. If they make it, they score eight. If they miss, their score goes back down to six. We are sports-, politics- and stats-loving nerds here at PunditFact, not game-callers, so we’ll conceal our two-cents on the proposal. The reason for it, though, left us intrigued. In honor of the Super Bowl, we wanted to know if Goodell was right about the rarity of missed extra points. Stats are widely available from places like ESPN and the NFL. In this case, they confirm Goodell’s point that the extra-point attempt is mostly a one-point gimme, with just five misses in 1,267 attempts in the 2013 regular season. Of the five missed attempts, four were blocked. Sept. 22: The Green Bay Packers blocked Cincinnati Bengals kicker Mike Nugent’s extra-point attempt in the fourth quarter. Cincinnati won anyway, 34-30. Sept. 22: The Pittsburgh Steelers stuffed a fourth-quarter attempt by Chicago Bears kicker Robbie Gould. The missed PAT was NBD for the Bears, who won 40-23. Nov. 3: Minnesota Vikings kicker Blair Walsh missed his third try for an extra point late in a close game against the Dallas Cowboys. The Vikings lost 27-23. Dec. 8: The Detroit Lions lost to the Philadelphia Eagles 34-20 in a matchup marred by heavy snow. The snow was so intense that Lions kicker David Akers missed his only attempt of the day. He slipped and fell, bringing to mind Charlie Brown, as the Eagles blocked his try. (GIF!) Dec. 22: Jacksonville Jaguars kicker Josh Scobee got a PAT blocked by the Tennessee Titans just before halftime. The Jaguars went on to lose 20-16. The missed PATs by the Jaguars and Vikings could have potentially made a difference in the outcome of the game. Instead of having to shoot for a touchdown to win, those teams could have fought for field-goal range and tried to tie up the game by closing the margin to three points. The league-wide record for missed extra points in 2013 was a low in recent years, down from six misses in 2012, seven in 2011 and 11 in 2010. The latter year was particularly memorable, with the Washington Redskins botching the snap on a PAT attempt that would have tied the game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers with just seconds to play. And even though it’s comical or crushing depending on your allegiance, let’s relive the notorious wide-right extra point by the New Orleans Saints in 2003. The Saints had the chance to tie up the game against the Jaguars after a near-miraculous touchdown of three lateral passes and no time left on the clock. But nope. Our ruling Let’s sum up our findings: Is the point-after touchdown attempt an almost pre-determined outcome that propels kickers to the top of scoring charts? Yes. More pertinently, did Goodell have his stats straight? Also yes. In football terms, Goodell’s claim is up and it’s GOOD! At PunditFact, we call that True.

pomt-06040	Tampa is "the strip club capital of the world."	false	/florida/statements/2012/jan/13/ellyn-bogdanoff/tampa-strip-club-capital-world/	Fill in the blank: Tampa is known around the world for ______. Is it professional sports teams? Bern's Steak House? Busch Gardens? Kind of feels like we’re dancing around something. Wait, that's it -- strip clubs! Tampa's reputation as a mecca for lusty dance came up in discussion of another vice this week -- gambling. State Sen. Ellyn Bogdanoff, a Fort Lauderdale Republican, wanted to thwart claims that new destination resort casinos she supports would tarnish Florida’s family-friendly rep. "People do not go to South Beach to see Mickey Mouse. They just don't," she said at the end of debate on her gambling bill Monday. "They go there for different reasons. We have the strip club capital of the world in Tampa. I hate to say it out loud, but we do. We have not ruined our family-friendly image." We've heard the same claim about Tampa for years. Maybe visitors remember the clubs because a few are on major roads. On Dale Mabry Highway just north of 275, the Mons Venus boasts "the Most Beautiful Women in the World!" Across the street, 2001 Odyssey's space ship building hovers over the surroundings. Rep. Janet Cruz, D-Tampa, said she doesn't think the title is a fair assessment. "I think that we are more lenient in some of what we allow," she said, "but I'm not sure we are the capital." A bit of evidence-based fact-checking seemed in order. We started by turning to local officials in Tampa, asking how many strip clubs are in the city. Adult stores and clubs -- or places showing "specified anatomical areas" -- must receive special permits for adult use, and pay a business tax, officials said. But the city could not pull a list of clubs of "special cabarets" within its limits, citing computer limitations. The city provided a list of businesses that have paid a business tax for "special cabarets," but there were only five businesses listed. That's not a complete picture of the city's strip clubs. Tampa Police didn't have a count either. We then turned to the business world for an answer, finding Clearwater-based E.D. Publications, a national magazine for the adult entertainment industry. (The "E.D." stands for Exotic Dancer.) The group publishes nationwide guides to night clubs, directories of industry vendors and rosters of touring entertainers. Associate publisher Dave Manack didn't hesitate when asked if Tampa is the strip club capital of the world. "No," he said. "Not even close. Tampa might not even make the Top 20. For anyone in the industry who knows, it’s really not a top market for strip clubs." Cities like New York, Las Vegas or Miami would have much more of a claim on the title, he said. According to the magazine's count, Tampa has 20 night clubs, and the entire Tampa Bay area has 30. Meanwhile, Miami has 30 in the city and 50 in the Miami/Fort Lauderdale corridor. (City of Miami officials did not return calls.) New York City has 45, not including Long Island or New Jersey. Las Vegas has 40 clubs. (We actually tallied 34 licensed nude and topless clubs in the Las Vegas region from local officials there, so counting clubs is not an exact science.) Manack ticked off several strikes against Tampa's claim to the title: Tampa doesn't have as many clubs as larger cities, and high-end national chains like Rick's Cabaret and the Spearmint Rhino have taken a pass on Tampa. The city's clubs are spread out, and because it has no tight-knit cluster to form a party circuit, it has trouble marketing itself as a destination for bachelor parties and conventioneers. Pinellas County shares some of the blame, too, he said. Local rules make it difficult to open high-end clubs near the beaches where dancers can significantly disrobe. "Literally, you could see more at the beach. It does hurt the clubs there," he said. A spokeswoman with another industry group, the Association of Club Executives, also discounted Tampa's place in the strip club world. "Manhattan has many more clubs than the Tampa area," said spokeswoman Angelina Spencer. "And if you’re going to talk about the true strip club capital of the world, it would be Las Vegas." Her association, a political and legal advocacy group for club owners based in Washington, keeps a census that includes 3,829 clubs nationwide, but it will not release numbers by locality. If Tampa isn't the strip club capital of the world, we wondered if perhaps it might be No. 1 on a per capita basis. That metric would account for Tampa being a smaller city than New York or Miami. But a 2006 economic development study from the Tampa Bay Partnership found the city was merely No. 3 for strip clubs on a per capita basis, ranking behind Las Vegas, and -- even more deflating -- Cincinnati. Tampa strip club king Joe Redner told us the title was actually bestowed on the city by opponents of strip clubs who were trying to stop clubs from opening. "It's a misnomer," he said. "That’s what people said when they wanted to get rid of the strip clubs. That's what they labeled us." One opponent is David Caton, executive director of the Florida Family Association. He said that when he looked into the issue six or seven years ago, Tampa had more strip clubs than any other city in the country. His count included businesses that show full nudity and nude modeling shops. But that's at odds with what the 2006 study found. Still, there is a reason Tampa is known nationally for strip clubs, said Manack of E.D. Publications, and that's Joe Redner. "He is one of the most well-known figures in the history of the adult nightclub industry," Manack said. "He's known as a crusader for personal freedom and freedom of speech, and he’s never been afraid of a fight." Bogdanoff told us the strip club capital title was something she heard and read. "It seemed to me that it was pretty well understood," she said. Our ruling Look, we won't lie: We were kind of hoping this claim might be Pants on Fire, if for no other reason than the potential play on words. Hot Pants on Fire! Pants(less) on Fire! Pants off Fire. But we're not quite there, in large part because we were unable to find precise strip club data for Tampa.

pomt-05968	There are 86 languages spoken at Miami Dade College.	true	/florida/statements/2012/jan/24/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-miami-dade-college-students-speak-86/	Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney are trying to woo Spanish-speaking voters despite taking stances that have alienated some Hispanics. One of the debate moderators pounced on that hypocrisy at the Jan. 23, 2012, debate in Tampa. Here’s how Beth Reinhard of the National Journal (and a former Miami Herald politics writer) posed her question: "All of you favor making English the official language of the United States, which could mean that ballots and other government documents would not be available in Spanish. But, Speaker Gingrich, you’re sending out press releases in Spanish; Governor Romney, you’re advertising in Spanish. Why is it okay for you to court voters in Spanish, but not okay for the government to serve them in Spanish? Speaker Gingrich?" "Well, first of all, you immediately jump down to a very important language, but not the only language," Gingrich answered. "The challenge of the United States is simple. There are 86 languages in Miami Dade College, 86. There are over 200 languages spoken in Chicago. Now, how do you unify the country? What is the common bond that enables people to be both citizens and to rise commercially and have a better life and a greater opportunity?" To unify the country, Gingrich said, "I think it is essential to have a central language that we expect people to learn and to be able to communicate with each other in." Reinhard: "So to be clear, you would only have ballots in English?" Gingrich: "I would have ballots in English. And I think you could have programs where virtually everybody would be able to read the ballots." We couldn’t resist checking Gingrich’s detail that "there are 86 languages in Miami Dade College." Gingrich spokesman R.C. Hammond told us in an email that Gingrich was referring to the number of languages spoken by students. First, a word about Miami Dade College. The school calls itself the "largest and most diverse college in the nation." Its website states that it enrolls more minorities than any other college or university in the country, including the most Hispanics. Miami Dade College spokesman Juan Mendieta told us that the 174,000 students speak 85 languages in addition to English, for a total of 86 languages for the 2010-11 year. Those students come from 181 countries. Both numbers are based on what students reported during the admissions process, he said. "It could be potentially more languages -- these are the languages students said they speak," Mendieta said. Mendieta said: "It’s basically representing every one of the four corners of the earth. At graduation we parade across the stage the flags representing the study body. … The last flag on stage, which brings down the house, is the American flag." The college reported in 2010 that English was the native language of half the students, Spanish was the native language of 43 percent, and Creole/French was the third-most common. Among the less common: Assamese (a language spoken in India), Breton (a Celtic language spoken in parts of France) and Wolof (an African language). The 86 languages spoken by students at Miami Dade College were also cited in a proposed 2010 U.S. Senate resolution congratulating Miami Dade College on its 50th anniversary. The college’s diversity and size make it a common stop in recent years for presidents and presidential candidates from both parties. The college was expecting a visit from Romney on Jan. 25, 2012, and a group of students were planning to attend an event with Gingrich at the Univision studio on Jan. 25, said Mendieta. Gingrich said, "There are 86 languages in Miami Dade College, 86." We found that in this case Gingrich has a good memory for detail.

pomt-01706	Uncompensated care has "gone down by 30 percent just in the first few months" of Medicaid expansion in the states that adopted it.	true	/virginia/statements/2014/aug/10/george-barker/sen-george-barker-says-uncompensated-care-has-fall/	Virginia Democrats believe they have found evidence showing states that expand their Medicaid rolls are better off than those that reject expansion. Sen. George Barker, D-Fairfax, told those gathered for an expansion rally in Woodbridge that hospitals in Medicaid expansion states have fewer patients who can’t pay. "Those states who have adopted Medicaid expansion, and half of the states have -- what they have seen just in the first few months of this calendar year, 2014 – is a reduction in uncompensated care," he said. "That means people who show up at the hospital, show up at the emergency department, are uninsured and can’t pay anything – charity care that’s provided by the hospital – that’s gone down by 30 percent just in the first few months." This seems to be an important point for their case, so we wondered about the origin of the figure. First, let’s remember how we got here. The Affordable Care Act -- also known as Obamacare -- gives states the option of expanding Medicaid eligibility. Uncle Sam will pick up the entire tab for new enrollees during the next two years, that slowly declines to 90 percent with state’s picking up the remaining cost.Virginia has estimated that as many as 400,000 state residents could join Medicaid’s rolls. The Republican-controlled House of Delegates refused to broaden the program, saying the federal government can’t be trusted to pay its promised share. That led to a months-long stalemate between the House and the Democratic-controlled Senate on the state’s two-year budget. Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, who earned a Promise Broken by signing a budget that did not include expansion, is exploring whether he can broaden the program without the consent of the legislature. Uncompensated care is a key reason Virginia hospitals have pleaded with legislators to expand Medicaid. Across the country, uncompensated care totaled $45.9 billion in 2012, the most recent year for which data was available, according to the American Hospital Association. It was 6.1 percent of hospitals’ expenses that year. When we asked Barker about his claim, he sent us a link to an article from Governing magazine. The article cites a study from the Colorado Hospital Association that looked at 30 states, 15 with Medicaid expansion and 15 without. In the states with expansion, hospitals had charity care decreases from an average of $2.8 million per hospital in the first quarter of 2013 to $1.9 million per hospital in the first quarter of 2014, a 32 percent drop. And out-of-pocket charges decreased from 4.7 percent of all charges to 3.1 percent of all charges -- a 34 percent drop. Meanwhile, Medicaid charges surged from 15.3 percent to 18.8 percent, a 19 percent jump. While the survey covered a short period of time, the difference between hospitals in states with Medicaid expansion and those without was stark. States that balked at Medicaid expansion saw little change in their uncompensated care levels, the study found. Governing also linked to Arkansas Democratic Gov. Mike Beebe’s May 31 column in which he stated 42 hospitals in the state reported an average of 30 percent decline in uncompensated care. For emergency room visits, the hospitals had an average of 24 percent drop in uncompensated care. Beebe said the survey "was not comprehensive for every acute-care center in the state, but it’s a good snapshot of early progress." Tenet Health, a publicly traded company with 80 hospitals in 14 states, reported that its hospitals in four states that expanded Medicaid saw a 33 percent decline in uninsured and charity admissions in the first quarter this year. In the second quarter, which ended in June, the numbers improved even more. With hospitals in five states that expanded Medicaid, the company had a decline in uninsured and charity admissions of 54 percent. Meanwhile, Medicaid admissions increased 23 percent. We also found an Arizona Daily Star article reporting on a survey of hospitals in the state done by the Arizona Hospital and Healthcare Association. In the first four months of 2014, the association’s hospitals reported a 31 percent drop in uncompensated care expenses compared to the same period in 2013. So this seems to be a broader trend. This is how the law was intended to work, said Gayle Nelson, director of hospital community benefit program at The Hilltop Institute, part of University of Maryland, Baltimore County. "This was all part and parcel of the same anticipation that this would happen," she said. "The need for uncompensated care would reduce and the funds needed to address uncompensated care would also be reduced … This is good news. Of course, in those states where uncompensated care is reduced, that presumably leaves some resources freed up to be used in other ways." The Governing article said the trend was positive, but hospitals are hoping it’s enough to offset cuts called for in the Affordable Care Act. The biggest piece of this will be $39 billion in cuts to the Disproportionate Share Hospital program, which helps hospitals that serve the poor. In Virginia, this primarily means the University of Virginia and Virginia Commonwealth University hospitals. Our ruling Barker said hospitals in states with Medicaid expansion have already benefited from a 30 percent drop in uncompensated care. The evidence is based on the first three months after Medicaid expansion took effect and from a few sources. It’s early, but he accurately reported the results. The statement is True.

pomt-12015	North Carolina is home to "two rivers of the top five most polluted rivers" in the U.S.	false	/north-carolina/statements/2017/sep/20/billy-richardson/nc-democrat-says-states-rivers-are-among-top-5-mos/	It’s one thing to say a couple of North Carolina’s rivers — the Neuse and the Cape Fear — are in danger of becoming very polluted. A report from one reputable environmental advocacy group supports that, and other groups are worried too. It’s another thing to say what state Rep. William "Billy" Richardson said about the Cape Fear and Neuse Rivers on Aug. 31. Richardson, a Fayetteville Democrat, urged his fellow legislators to commit more funding to the state Department of Environmental Quality during a speech on the state House floor. "There are 250,000 rivers in this country," Richardson said. "Two rivers of the top five most polluted rivers are right here in North Carolina." He was referring to the Cape Fear and the Neuse. Are the Cape Fear and the Neuse among America’s top five most-polluted rivers? And where is this "most polluted rivers" list he alludes to? We’ll get to that. First, some background on why Richardson and others, including Gov. Roy Cooper, are so worried about the Cape Fear, in particular. This summer it came to light that the Chemours plant near Fayetteville may have improperly dumped a chemical called GenX into the Cape Fear, which provides drinking water for much of southeastern North Carolina. GenX is used to make Teflon, the nonstick substance that Chemours makes at its Fayetteville Works plant. The state is accusing the company and its predecessor, DuPont, of failing to inform regulators that they were releasing GenX into the river — and earlier this month the state sued Chemours over the discharges. Meanwhile, Cooper and other Democratic legislators want to allot more resources to DEQ so the department can research the spill’s effects. But they’re mad because the Republican-controlled legislature in June cut DEQ’s budget by $1.8 million over the next two years, and DEQ’s leader says the department doesn’t have the funds needed to deal with the Cape Fear chemical pollution long-term. Enter Richardson and his claim about North Carolina being home to two of the top five "most polluted" rivers in the country. The dangers of hog waste Richardson wasn't immediately available for comment. His assistant, Leigh Lawrence, said Richardson was referencing the 2017 edition of the American Rivers organization’s annual "America’s most endangered rivers" list. The list ranks the Cape Fear and Neuse together as the seventh most endangered rivers in America. On the phone, Lawrence acknowledged that Richardson might’ve misspoke but that he "cares deeply" about the environment, referencing a bill he filed earlier this year to try to protect part of the Cape Fear from regulation rollbacks. Richardson, for his part, later called PolitiFact to say that he once saw a list of America's most polluted rivers that supports his argument – but that he's had trouble finding it. Regardless of any lists or rankings, he said, the rivers have serious issues that need to be addressed. "My intention was not to mislead anyone," Richardson said. "Between the numerous articles that point to the troubles on the Neuse and Cape fear basin ... and then you throw in GenX, it’s clear we’ve got a huge issue that we’re not dealing with." Nonetheless, American Rivers told PolitiFact that their "most endangered" list shouldn’t be viewed as a "most polluted" list. In fact, the first page of the report says: "This report is not a list of the nation’s 'worst' or most polluted rivers, but rather it highlights rivers confronted by critical decisions that will determine their future." "The big difference between ’most polluted’ and ‘most endangered’ is that when we list a river as ‘most endangered’ it is because there is a decision that is coming up that depending on how that decision is made will have a major impact on the river," said Peter Raabe, the group’s conservation director for rivers of Southern Appalachia and the Carolinas. In this case, American Rivers is calling on state lawmakers to restore funding to a program that helps farmers move hog waste lagoons out of the floodplain. Hog waste lagoons are outdoor basins where farmers store hog waste. The group’s "most endangered" report doesn’t mention GenX, but is very concerned about hog waste getting into the rivers. The Neuse and Cape Fear River basins "have endured two 500-year floods from hurricanes in less than 20 years, during which dozens of animal waste lagoons within the 100-year floodplain were flooded or breached, discharging millions of gallons of raw animal waste directly into the rivers," the report says. Hurricane Matthew, specifically "partially submerged 10 industrial hog facilities with 39 barns, 26 large chicken-raising operations with 102 barns, and 14 open-air pits holding millions of gallons of liquid hog manure, releasing untreated waste directly into the rivers." The North Carolina Pork Council, for its part, told The Washington Post in October that reports of spills were exaggerated and that there’d been zero waste pits breached and just 11 flooded. Endangered vs. polluted Raabe, among other environmental experts PolitiFact spoke with, said it’s difficult to determine which rivers are the "most polluted" because there are different types of pollution that are all similarly bad. "There are so many things that ‘pollute’ our rivers — GenX, 1,4-Dioxane, untreated sewer water, heavy metals, algal growth, bacteria, wastewater from failing septic, too much water, too little water, spills from oil pipelines, spills from trucks on highways, etc.," Raabe said. "The Neuse and the Cape Fear Rivers have a lot of issues that need to be addressed but so do all the streams that have been impacted by human activity." Should residents be worried? City and county water treatment plants do a great job of testing for and eradicating many pollutants from the water, he said. "The problem is, that water is only treated for pollutants we know about. Chemicals like GenX and many other contaminants of emerging concern are not tested for," Raabe said. Other pollution rankings? So American Rivers doesn’t have a "most polluted" list. PolitiFact wondered if the federal government tracks which rivers are the most polluted. Turns out, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the federal government body that aims to protect human health and the environment) "does not rank waterbodies and we don't keep a list of the most polluted rivers," spokeswoman Enesta Jones said. Experts at other environmental groups that PolitiFact spoke with – including the Upper Neuse Riverkeeper, Environment America and the EPA – echoed Raabe in saying it’s difficult to determine which rivers are most polluted. Every two years, state governments are required to tell the EPA which of their local rivers are impaired. Davina Marraccini, an EPA public affairs specialist, warned the public against comparing reports. "Note that because of differences in state assessment methods, the information on the website should not be used to compare water quality conditions between states or to determine water quality trends," Marraccini wrote in an email. Through Google searches, PolitiFact couldn’t find a comprehensive, definitive list by a reputable organization that describes a North Carolina river as one of the "top five most polluted." Our ruling Richardson said that N.C. is home to two of the "top five" most-polluted rivers in the state. His assistant acknowledged that he might've misquoted the American Rivers "most endangered" list – but PolitiFact looked around to see if other data might support his claim. There’s evidence that the Neuse River and Cape Fear River, in particular, are threatened not only by waste from local farms but by a chemical that state regulators want to investigate. However, PolitiFact found no basis for Richardson’s claim that North Carolina rivers rank among the top five most polluted in the United States. We rate this claim false.

pomt-06311	George Allen's flat tax "plan would actually shrink revenues further than the Perry (flat tax) plan."	false	/virginia/statements/2011/nov/14/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-says-george-allen-flat-tax-plan-shrinks-/	Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Tim Kaine recently took aim at Republican rival George Allen’s support of a flat tax. In an Oct. 31 news release, Kaine’s campaign linked a statement by Allen to a flat tax proposal recently made by Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who is seeking the GOP presidential nomination. Perry’s plan would allow people to opt out of the current tax system and pay a flat 20 percent federal levy on their income. During a Fox News interview on Oct. 30, the governor did not dispute host Chris Wallace’s assertion that the flat tax proposal, by the estimates of Perry’s campaign, would reduce federal revenue by $4.7 trillion from 2014 to 2020. "I think Americans are ready for Washington, D.C., to quit spending money," Perry said. The next day, Kaine’s campaign put out a statement saying Allen supports a 17 percent flat tax -- lower than Perry’s 20 percent. "That means Allen’s plan would actually shrink revenues further than the Perry plan, forcing even harsher cuts to programs that Virginians depend on," the news release said. We wondered if Kaine was correct in saying Allen backs a flat tax plan that would cut revenues more than Perry’s proposal. Under the Texas governor’s plan, flat tax filers would receive a $12,500 exemption for each dependent and would not pay levies on capital gains and social security benefits. Perry’s proposal would preserve deductions on mortgage interest and charitable contributions, as well as state and local taxes, but phases them out for people with incomes of more than $500,000. He would also drop the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent. Flat tax supporters say the lower levies would fuel economic expansion; critics say the plans would sap more revenues than can be made up by added growth. An analysis of Perry’s plan by economic consultants John Dunham and Associates, done at the behest of the Perry campaign, said it could drain about $5 trillion in federal revenues through 2020. What, exactly, is Allen proposing? We’re not sure, and Allen’s campaign isn’t providing many clues. Kaine, in the news release, based his contention that Allen backs a 17 percent flat tax on a statement Allen made during a June 14, 2011, news conference when he released his economic platform. Allen endorsed the concept of an optional flat tax. There are a lot of people who would actually like to say, "Alright, here is my income, multiply it by, say, .17, and file it on one page,’" he said. The Kaine campaign provided us with transcripts and tapes of two other appearances where Allen used the 17 percent flat tax example. In both cases, Allen used the word "say" before he uttered 17 percent, creating some hedge room. Dan Allen, an Allen policy adviser, said the candidate’s wording shows he was throwing out a hypothetical number. A variety of flat tax plans throughout the years have called for flat tax rates of 17 to 25 percent, Dan Allen said. The text of George Allen’s economic proposals, titled "The Blueprint for America’s Comeback," calls for a flat-tax alternative but offers no details. We asked Allen’s campaign for specifics -- such as what percentage of income should be subject to a flat tax and what deductions and exemptions should be allowed. But Dan Allen said the Republican has never settled on a single flat tax plan to support. "To say there’s one Allen plan is not accurate," said Dan Allen, who is not related to George Allen. He referred us to George Allen’s 2010 book, "What Washington can Learn from the World of Sports," in which the Republican said he’s supported a variety of flat tax proposals. One plan lauded in Allen’s book would establish an optional flat levy on combined federal payroll and income taxes, set at 25 percent of gross income. Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, said he suspects that proposal would drain more revenue than Perry’s plan because it affects two levies. Perry’s proposal only applies to income tax, not payroll tax. Williams wrote earlier this month that Perry’s proposal "would dramatically reduce tax revenues," by a much as $1 trillion in 2015. But he told us he can’t definitively say whether Allen would cut off more government revenue than Perry because he doesn’t know the details of what Allen is proposing. Our ruling: Kaine says Allen’s flat tax "plan would actually shrink revenues further" than a flat tax proposal made by Texas Gov. Rick Perry. Kaine is correct is in saying Perry endorses a 20 percent flat tax on income, but stretches the truth when he says Allen has made a proposal that would set the rate lower. Allen, while endorsing the concept of an optional flat tax, has offered no plan of his own. The basis of Kaine’s charge are Allen’s statements that a flat tax rate could be set at "say, 17 percent." That’s hardly a plan or an endorsement of a flat tax rate, so there’s no substance to compare to Perry’s proposal. We don’t fault Kaine for demanding specificity from Allen. But Kaine goes too far when he tries to create a plan for Allen based on inconclusive statements. We rate Kaine’s claim False.	None	Tim Kaine	None	None	None	2011-11-14T20:00:00	2011-10-31	['None']

"Saudi Arabia to Behead 6 School Girls for Being With Their Male Friends Without Parents or a Guardian," stated the headline on religionmind.com on Oct. 23. That’s not true. We found the story after Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. Religionmind.com is a fake news website about various religions. We attempted to contact someone at the website but did not get a reply. The "about" section of the website states that it tries to keep the content correct, "yet we make no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, about the completeness, accuracy, reliability, suitability ... ." Here’s what the fake news story said: Fathima Al Kwaini was celebrating her birthday at a friend’s house. Tipped off by an assistant of an Imam, police arrived to find the girls dancing with their friends including males. Police arrested the girls. The article then states that the girls were detained for more than a year and that a male-only Sharia panel concluded that they need to be "executed in accordance with the Sharia law." A photo in the article does not back up the narrative. It appears to be the same as a photo by Reuters/Pajhwok News Agency on Aug. 31, 2015, showing an Afghan judge hitting a 22-year-old woman with a whip in front of a crowd in Ghor province, Afghanistan. The article attributed some of the information to "HRW" without explaining what the acronym stands for. We thought it might have been a reference to Human Rights Watch, an organization that tracks human rights abuses across the globe. A researcher at Human Rights Watch, Adam Coogle, told PolitiFact that the story is a fabrication. "Gender mixing in Saudi Arabia can lead to criminal penalties but never the death penalty," he said. So far in 2017 there have been 133 executions in Saudi Arabia, nearly all for murder or drug smuggling. "In terms of executions of children, unfortunately Saudi Arabia is one of the only countries in the world that continues to sentence child offenders to death, and some have eventually been executed, but I’ve never seen an execution of anyone who is under 18 at the time of the execution," he said. In the case of this headline, there is no evidence that these girls were beheaded for being with their male friends. We rate this Pants on Fire.

pomt-14725	"Only nine" coalition nations with the U.S. "are truly actively involved" in fighting the Islamic State.	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2015/dec/22/rob-wittman/rob-wittman-mostly-right-about-few-nations-fightin/	Although dozens of nations have pledged to fight the Islamic State, few actually have joined the U.S. in taking military steps against the group, says U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, R-1st. During a recent interview on C-SPAN, Wittman said the U.S. could use some help in the air campaign against the Islamic State. "Of the 65 coalition partners, only nine are truly actively involved in these efforts," he said. "This will not be successful if we don’t have those coalition partners involved." We wondered if Wittman is correct that only nine nations have joined the U.S. in taking military action against the Islamic State. Farahn Morgan, Wittman’s spokeswoman, said the congressman got the figure from a Nov. 30 article in The Washington Times. Morgan pointed to a comment in the article from Anthony Cordesman, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who criticized the White House approach to the air campaign and said, "This is a ‘65-country coalition’ of which only about nine are doing something." The U.S. State Department does indeed count 65 countries as members of a broad coalition aimed at eliminating the Islamic State threat. The department says those nations are participating in different ways: providing military support, stopping the Islamic State’s financing, impeding the flow of foreign fighters into the area, dealing with humanitarian crises, and exposing the "true nature" of the militant group. A Nov. 18 report from the Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan fact-finding arm of Congress, offers examples of non-military contributions. They include Switzerland’s $9 million of aid to Iraq -- where the Islamic State is present -- and Japan’s $6 million of aid to help refugees in northern Iraq. The military component of the coalition is Operation Inherent Resolve, and 22 nations have pledged to take part in it, according to CRS. About two-thirds of those countries have provided military personnel to help train local forces to battle the Islamic State. A smaller group of a dozen countries have provided aircraft to take part in airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Syria and Iraq since the military campaign started in August 2014, according to the Department of Defense. Those countries are Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Jordan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. As of Dec. 9, the U.S.-led coalition had conducted 8,783 airstrikes, according to the Pentagon. The U.S. conducted 6,846 of those attacks, or about four-fifths of them. It’s difficult to get an exact read on the current number of allies still active in the campaign for a couple of reasons. Participation in the military campaign ebbs and flows depending on each nation’s interests, the Congressional Research Service noted in its report. For example, Belgium stopped its airstrikes at the end of June due to budget constraints. Incoming Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced in October that his government would withdraw its combat aircraft, but it’s unclear if that has happened yet, the research service said. Airwars.org, a non-profit that tracks the air war in Iraq and Syria, reported in October that Denmark recalled the seven F-16s it used against the Islamic State, although they may return. The New York Times reported on Nov. 7 that some Arab countries in the coalition, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, have shifted most of their aircraft away battling the Islamic State and instead focused them on the fight against a rebel uprising in Yemen. Allied officials told the newspaper that the United Arab Emirates hadn’t carried out strikes in Syria since March and Jordan hadn’t done so since August. Qatar flies patrols over Syria, but "its role has been modest," The Times said. Wittman hardly is the first to complain the U.S. isn’t getting enough coalition support in battling the Islamic State. Our colleagues at PolitiFact National recently examined a similar claim by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and rated it Mostly True. David Weinberg, a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, told PolitiFact that of the dozen allies the Pentagon says actually have conducted airstrikes, "some of those are only symbolic or largely out of date." Weinberg said the countries with the best case for taking a "serious" role in the air campaign, outside of the U.S., are France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Australia. Chris Woods, the director of Airwars.org, said some coalition members are providing auxiliary assistance to the campaign even if they are not taking part in airstrikes. Italy, for example, provides aircraft for in-air refueling, and Germany has said it will provide six Tornado fighter jets for aerial reconnaissance. Michael O’Hanlon, co-director of the Center for 21st Century Security and Intelligence at the Brookings Institution, told us that the figure Wittman uses to tally the number of allies taking part in military action against the Islamic State sounds correct. "I don’t have concrete data, but I’d say that the number nine is roughly correct if one is talking about military action," O’Hanlon wrote in an email. Our ruling Wittman, in arguing the U.S. isn’t getting enough help in the heavy lifting against the Islamic State, said just nine of our international coalition partners are "truly actively involved" in military efforts against the militant group. The figure is credible based on government data and media reports. Thirteen nations have taken part in airstrikes against the group during the past year, according to the Pentagon. There are indications that perhaps half of the countries have suspended their roles against the Islamic State, although they may resume in the future. The lack of transparency from some coalition governments makes it impossible define a precise number at any given time. Also, we should note that some countries are contributing to the military campaign in ways other than airstrikes - such as providing aircraft for refueling, reconnaissance and military personnel to train local forces. With those clarifications, we rate Wittman’s statement Mostly True.	None	Rob Wittman	None	None	None	2015-12-22T08:13:07	2015-12-09	['United_States']
pomt-07486	President Obama has "stopped using the phrase 'war on terror.' "	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/13/tim-pawlenty/tim-pawlenty-says-obama-has-stopped-using-phrase-w/	In his book Courage to Stand, former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, a potential GOP presidential candidate, said President Barack Obama "needs to do a more forceful job of reminding people about the threat of global terrorism." And that needs to start with calling it by its real name, Pawlenty wrote. "Sadly, President Obama will not call this effort what it is," Pawlenty wrote. "He has stopped using the phrase 'war on terror.' His administration never makes pointed references -- or any references -- to the real problem: radical Islamic terrorism. Apparently that isn't politically correct. The fact is, radical Islamic terrorism exists. Pointing that out doesn't condemn all Muslims. But there is an element of Islam that is radical and that has terrorist intentions. We need to call it what it is. We need to confront it, and we need to defeat it." This isn't the first time Obama has been accused of ducking the phrase "war on terror" or for not attaching the words Islamic or Muslim when talking about violent extremists. Back in November 2009, we checked into a similar claim from Fox News' Sean Hannity that "Barack Obama won't even use the term 'war on terrorism.' " Back then, we did a word search of Obama's public statements and could not find that Obama has used the phrase "war on terrorism" as president, though he said it numerous times as a candidate. Early in his presidency, Obama used the phrase "war on terror," but only a couple of times. And it's true that Obama made a conscious and deliberate decision early in his presidency to avoid the phrase "war on terror" in favor of more precise language. Obama explained his reasoning in several interviews. During a Jan. 27, 2009, interview with Obama, Hisham Melhem of Arabic-language television news station al-Aribiya noted that Obama seemed to eschew President George W. Bush's phrase "war on terror" and "frame it in a different way, specifically against one group called al-Qaida and their collaborators." Said Obama: "I think that you're making a very important point. And that is that the language we use matters. And what we need to understand is, is that there are extremist organizations -- whether Muslim or any other faith in the past -- that will use faith as a justification for violence. We cannot paint with a broad brush a faith as a consequence of the violence that is done in that faith's name. "And so you will, I think, see our administration be very clear in distinguishing between organizations like al-Qaida -- that espouse violence, espouse terror and act on it -- and people who may disagree with my administration and certain actions, or may have a particular viewpoint in terms of how their countries should develop. We can have legitimate disagreements but still be respectful. I cannot respect terrorist organizations that would kill innocent civilians, and we will hunt them down. "But to the broader Muslim world what we are going to be offering is a hand of friendship." The issue was again raised in a Feb. 3, 2009, interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper: Cooper: "I've noticed you don't use the term 'war on terror.' I think I read an article that you've only used it once since inauguration. Is that conscious? Is there something about that term you find objectionable or not useful?" Obama: "Well, you know, I think it is very important for us to recognize that we have a battle or a war against some terrorist organizations. But that those organizations aren't representative of a broader Arab community, Muslim community. ... You know, words matter in this situation because one of the ways we're going to win this struggle is through the battle of hearts and minds." Cooper: "So that's not a term you're going to be using much in the future?" Obama: "You know, what I want to do is make sure that I'm constantly talking about al-Qaida and other affiliated organizations because we, I believe, can win over moderate Muslims to recognize that that kind of destruction and nihilism ultimately leads to a dead end, and that we should be working together to make sure that everybody has got a better life. Based on those facts, we rated Hannity's claim True. But when former Vice president Dick Cheney took the meme a step further and alleged that Obama will not "admit we're at war," we rated Cheney's claim Pants in Fire. Here, Pawlenty's claim is closer to Hannity's. So first we checked Obama's public statements since our previous fact-check to see if he has stuck to this line and avoided the phrase "war on terror" or anything like "radical Islamic terrorism." And he has. In May 2010, John Brennan, assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, addressed the topic in some detail: "The president’s strategy is absolutely clear about the threat we face," Brennan said in an address at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "Our enemy is not 'terrorism' because terrorism is but a tactic. Our enemy is not 'terror' because terror is a state of mind, and as Americans we refuse to live in fear. Nor do we describe our enemy as 'jihadists' or 'Islamists' because jihad is a holy struggle, a legitimate tenant of Islam, meaning to purify oneself or one’s community, and there is nothing holy or legitimate or Islamic about murdering innocent men, women and children. "Indeed, characterizing our adversaries this way would actually be counterproductive. It would play into the false perception that they are religious leaders defending a holy cause, when in fact they are nothing more than murderers, including the murder of thousands upon thousands of Muslims." "Moreover," Brennan said, "describing our enemy in religious terms would lend credence to the lie—propagated by al-Qaida and its affiliates to justify terrorism—that the United States is somehow at war against Islam. The reality, of course, is that we never have been and will never be at war with Islam. After all, Islam, like so many faiths, is part of America. "Instead, the president’s strategy is clear and precise. Our enemy is al-Qaida and its terrorist affiliates. For it was al-Qaida who attacked us so viciously on 9/11 and whose desire to attack the United States, our allies, and our partners remains undiminished. And it is its affiliates who have taken up al-Qaida’s call to arms against the United States in other parts of the world. "The president’s strategy is unequivocal with regard to our posture. The United States of America is at war. We are at war against al-Qaida and its terrorist affiliates. That is why the president is responsibly ending the war in Iraq, which had nothing to do with 9/11, and why he has refocused our efforts on Afghanistan, where al-Qaida continues to plot from the tribal regions along the border with Pakistan and inside of Pakistan." More recently, in remarks at the Adams Center, a nonprofit that runs community centers and mosques, on March 6, 2011, Denis McDonough, deputy national security adviser to the president, spoke about the strategy of the Obama administration's words. "President Obama recognizes that through our words and deeds we can either play into al-Qaida’s narrative and messaging, or we can challenge it and thereby undermine it," McDonough said. "We’re determined to undermine it." In his book, Pawlenty claims Obama has stopped using the phrase "war on terror" and his administration "never makes pointed references -- or any references -- to the real problem: radical Islamic terrorism." We found several instances in which Vice President Joe Biden has talked about "radical extremism" or "radical fundamentalism" and the need to aggressively confront "violent extremism and radical ideologies." But he never attaches the words "Islamic" to those phrases. And neither has Obama. As Obama and members of his administration have repeatedly explained, this is a very conscious decision to be more precise about the enemy, al-Qaida and other terrorist affiliates and not to feed into the al-Qaida message that America is somehow at war with Islam. You may agree or disagree with Obama's word choices, or with Pawlenty's, but Pawlenty is correct about Obama's deliberate decision not to use the phrases "war on terror" or "radical Islamic terrorism." We rate his statement True.	None	Tim Pawlenty	None	None	None	2011-04-13T13:39:57	2011-01-11	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-02973	"As a result of Obamacare, we are becoming something of a part-time employment country."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/22/maria-bartiromo/bartiromo-says-obamacare-turning-us-part-time-empl/	Among the many problems that critics of Obamacare like to highlight, one of the more common is that the health care law undermines jobs and the economy. This was Maria Bartiromo’s theme when she was on NBC’s Meet the Press. Bartiromo, anchor of CNBC’s Closing Bell, said the glitches that have beset the rollout of Obamacare are not the only issue. "Businesses have changed their plans as a result of Obamacare," Bartiromo said. "We are becoming something of a part-time employment country. We're seeing some groups moved off of health care from business because business is complaining that it's too expensive." If we boil that down, we have this claim to check: "As a result of Obamacare, we are becoming something of a part-time employment country." Our research finds Bartiromo’s claim flawed. Not because we don’t have a lot of part-timers. We do. But the overwhelming driver is a lackluster recovery, not Obamacare. And when you look at the past, the percentage of part-timers has been even higher than it is today. A closer look We contacted CNBC and they pointed us to a couple of articles on Bartiromo’s behalf. One from Red Alert Politics, a website affiliated with the Weekly Standard and Washington Examiner, gave examples of companies that have said they will shift or might shift to using more part-time help. They said they would do this to avoid the Obamacare rule that firms of 50 or more employees must offer health insurance to anyone working 30 hours or more. The list included White Castle, the hamburger chain, and Trig’s, a Wisconsin supermarket chain. (The rule, which was supposed to go into effect Jan. 1, 2014, has been delayed by one year.) Another item was an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal. The CEO of a company that owns several fast-food chains, among them Hardee’s, made the claim that the "numbers show" that Obamacare is affecting hiring. The proof? The job numbers that came right after the administration announced in early July a one-year delay of the requirement that all larger employers offer health insurance. "Full-time job creation rebounded and part-time employment subsided," the CEO, Andrew Puzder, wrote. "In July and August, the economy lost 20,000 part-time jobs and added 132,000 full-time jobs." But that's a historical trend that coincides with the American summer; not necessarily a statement on Obamacare. Between June and August, historically, part-time employment falls and full-time employment increases -- partly because better weather boosts seasonal work in the construction and tourism industries. Numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that between 2003 and 2007, the average drop in part-time work was -.28 percent from July to August, while the average rise in full-time employment was 0.2 percent. It’s also worth noting that the firms that have announced plans to reduce hours for part-timers tend to be in fast food and retail. These industries might have a special reason to keep an eye on the employer mandate in the Affordable Care Act. They tend to use part-timers more than other sectors of the economy. The average hours worked per week by non-supervisory staff in fast-food restaurants was 25.7 in 2012 and in retail, the figure was 31.6. But for financial services, it was 37.4, manufacturing was 40.7 and construction was 38.8. For fast-food and retail, increasing the use of part-time work could be a viable strategy. That doesn’t mean they represent the entire job market. It’s the economy A report from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco puts the current situation into context. The recession drove up the fraction of part-time workers from about 17 percent in 2007 to a peak of 19.7 percent in 2010. It has declined since then. As of the latest data, it stands at 19 percent. The study’s bottom line is that recessions drive up the fraction of the workforce who are in part-time jobs when they would rather be working full-time. The 1983 recession pushed the share of part-timers to 20.3 percent. That’s significantly higher than the peak for the 2008 recession. What’s different this time though is that the part-time employment rate has remained higher for many more months than in past recessions. The authors put the cause squarely at the feet of the overall economy. "The U.S. labor market has recovered only about three-fourths of the jobs lost during the recession and its aftermath, which leaves finding a full-time job still challenging for many workers," they said. "General labor market slack remains the key factor keeping part-time employment high." The report considers whether the Affordable Care Act could be shaping employers' hiring decisions, but concludes that other factors -- including long-standing IRS rules -- suggest the ACA has not made a significant change. "Before the law was passed, most large employers already faced IRS rules that prevented them from denying available health benefits to full-time workers. These rules gave employers an incentive to create part-time jobs to avoid rising health benefit costs." Our ruling Bartiromo said under Obamacare "we are becoming something of a part-time employment country." There is anectdotal evidence that some companies are or will reduce the hours of some employees. But those individual instances fail to make a case of moving to a "part-time employment country." Government numbers actually show that the fraction of part-timers in the workforce has declined since 2010 and in a longer historical perspective, the share of part-timers was less during this recession than in the downturn of 1983. The argument that the delay of the employer mandate boosted full-time hires is suspect. We see the same trend in previous years well before President Barack Obama was elected. An independent analysis suggests that the lack of full-time work is the most significant explanation for a persistently high share of part-time work in the labor force. We rate the claim False.

pomt-04167	Thanks to actions by the Milwaukee County Board on the 2013 budget, the amount of county taxes on the average home in the city of Milwaukee "would be a $19 decrease."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/dec/19/marina-dimitrijevic/Milwaukee-County-Board-chairwoman-touts-decrease-i/	When the Milwaukee County Board completed its work on the 2013 budget in November 2012, the property tax levy was about $4 million higher than it was for the current year. Supervisors overrode 22 of 24 budget vetoes from County Executive Chris Abele, thwarting his effort to create a budget that included no increase. The final 2013 budget tallied $1.3 billion, with $279.3 million coming from property taxes. That’s an increase of 1.4 percent. County Board Chairwoman Marina Dimitrijevic defended the board’s budget in a Nov. 14, 2012, interview on WTMJ-AM (620), noting the budget boosted public safety. But then she touted the tax levy increase as a decrease for City of Milwaukee taxpayers. Huh? Here’s how Dimitrijevic explained it: "If you live in the City of Milwaukee, the City of Milwaukee our largest municipality, the 1.4 percent that we increased taxes this year -- lower than inflation, like the city of Milwaukee, like Ozaukee County – in the city of Milwaukee on the average home, would be a $19 decrease. And I think that’s a small price to pay for enhanced public safety." With property tax bills landing in mailboxes, time for a refresher course on how this all works. County Board fiscal and budget analyst Steve Cady said the claim was based on City of Milwaukee property revaluations, which were set in spring 2012. These are done annually to keep up with changes in the housing market. The average Milwaukee house had an assessed value of about $106,000. The tax rate set in the county budget is about $5.25 per $1,000 of assessed value. That’s up 54 cents. (On the tax bill, the county tax rate is lumped together with the rate to support the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission, but that group’s portion of the bill is tiny.) How much you owe is determined by the value of your house. In the 2012 reassessment, the average home in the city fell from $122,793 to $106,000. That means even though the tax rate went up, the bill for the county share of taxes went down on that home by about $19. So in dollars and cents terms, Dimitrijevic is correct. But there’s a lot more to the story. Across the country the value of residential property got hammered in the real estate bust, and Milwaukee was no exception. Between the beginning of 2008 and 2012, total assessed residential property value in Milwaukee fell by about 30 percent, said assessment commissioner Mary Reavey. Of course, it depends on your neighborhood and condition of your home -- some losses could be much higher (or lower) than others. "Most people don’t cheer when their major asset goes down in value," noted Paula Hogan, a certified financial planner who operates her own firm in Glendale. But, in effect, that is what Dimitrijevic is suggesting Milwaukee property owners do. What about the reverse? Should homeowners want their house values and tax bill to increase? Not necessarily, said Michael Arnow, a certified financial planner with Menomonee Falls-based Sattell, Johnson, Appel Financial Advisory LLC. "A higher assessment is a double-edged sword," he said. "If your tax bill goes up, you pay more taxes. Who wants to pay more taxes? If the value of your home goes up and you are a retiree on a fixed income you can be priced out of your neighborhood." In the case of this year’s bills, property owners may be paying somewhat less in taxes but the long-term loss is more serious, experts said. For that average City of Milwaukee homeowner, the total tax bill for all taxing units this year would be $3,175, down about $107 from a year ago. That’s a small amount compared with the $16,000 in lost property value. Said Hogan: "If taxes are going down because the assessed value is going down, that’s not a good thing." Our rating Dimitrijevic said the average city of Milwaukee homeowner would pay $19 less in county property taxes next year. She is correct on the bottom-line number. But by highlighting it as a piece of good news, she is leaving out critical information that would give a different impression. Namely, tax bills aren’t down because spending was cut by the County Board. The bills are down in the City of Milwaukee because property values have fallen. Had there been no change in city property values, that bill would be $84 higher -- just to pay for the County Board’s decisions. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-10059	"In Chicago, school is never canceled" because of winter weather.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jan/28/barack-obama/obama-says-chicago-schools-never-close-snow/	A veteran of many frosty winters in the Windy City, President Obama was incredulous to find out that classes at his daughters' new schools in Washington, D.C., had been canceled due to icy road conditions. "Can I make a comment that is unrelated to the economy very quickly?" Obama told reporters in a light moment at a gathering with business leaders on Jan. 28. "And it has to do with Washington. My children's school was canceled today. Because of, what? Some ice?" "As my children pointed out, in Chicago, school is never canceled," Obama said. "In fact, my 7-year-old pointed out that (during a winter storm) you'd go outside for recess. You wouldn't even stay indoors. So, I don't know. We're going to have to try to apply some flinty Chicago toughness." According to an AP report, Obama was asked if he meant the people of the national's capital are wimps, to which Obama responded: "I'm saying, when it comes to the weather, folks in Washington don't seem to be able to handle things." Chicago gets an average of about 3 feet of snow a year. Is it possible they don't need snow days? Turns out it's been 10 years. "The last time we had a snow day was on Jan. 4 and 5 of 1999," said Malon Edwards, spokesman for the Chicago Public Schools. That's when the Windy City got socked with 22 inches of snow, at the time the second-largest snowstorm in Chicago history. "We very rarely cancel for snow days." In mid January of this year, when temperatures dipped into negative numbers (sans wind chill), the school district told parents if they felt it was unsafe to send their kids to school that day, it'd be okay to keep them at home. But school stayed open. We should note that D.C. public schools weren't actually closed on Jan. 28. They opened two hours late. But Obama's daughters, Malia and Sasha, attend the private Sidwell Friends School, which canceled classes. Most school districts in the Washington suburbs also closed. Obama is right that snow days are amazingly rare in Chicago — there haven't been any in the last decade — but we'll cruelly ding him for saying "never." Mostly True.

pomt-12697	ShopRite will lose about 300 employees "voluntarily and through layoffs" due to the beverage tax.	half flip	/pennsylvania/statements/2017/mar/13/jeffrey-brown/did-shoprite-owner-say-philly-soda-tax-would-mean-/	Philadelphia soda distributors and supermarkets have said the beverage tax that went into effect Jan. 1 has caused significant decreases in beverage and total sales, forcing them to either drastically cut hours or lay off employees. Pepsi recently announced its plans to lay off up to 100 employees over three distribution plants within the city after experiencing a 40 percent dip in sales apparently from the new tax, and Canada Dry Delaware Valley also blamed recent months’ low sales for new layoffs. But the most significant reaction so far comes from Jeffrey Brown, owner of six ShopRite stores in Philadelphia and 10 in the Delaware Valley, who told Philly.com last month that he expected to lose about 300 employees "voluntarily and through layoffs" this spring. Two days after the article was published, though, on Fox 29, he ditched the part about layoffs and said he expects some attrition as his stores are forced to cut hours. "There will be some attrition, what happens when people don’t get enough hours, we’re unionized, so it goes by seniority, so when the new people, people that have been with us for like less than a year they get their hours cut. And when it gets cut beyond a certain point it’s not really worth their while to have the job and they start looking for other employment and the ones that don’t, we have to balance the numbers overtime," he told Fox 29. It wasn’t clear in that interview whether Brown had just forgotten to mention the layoffs he previously claimed were coming, or if he purposely steered in a different direction. But, in a follow up Philly.com article published Feb. 23, he referenced layoffs again, saying, "There’s no way of knowing the layoff number, but 280, 300 jobs will be gone one way or the other. If a person quits or goes on unemployment, or I lay them off, the jobs will be gone." The city has insisted businesses have been overreacting in their opposition to the tax, noting that the American Beverage Association last year spent over a million dollars in advertisements opposing Mayor Kenney’s plan to tax sugary beverages to pay for Philadelphia children to attend pre-K. Kenney's spokesperson, Lauren Hitt, noted, "Brown is part of the same industry that spent ten million dollars and made plenty of misleading claims trying to kill the tax last year." She also said via e-mail: "We feel that Philadelphians should be skeptical of any unverifiable numbers that Brown or any other members of the soda industry put out." Marc Stier, Director of the Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center, is also skeptical of Brown's claim that there's been a 40 to 50 percent drop in ShopRite's beverage sales, and a 15 percent dip in overall sales. He said he doubts the drop in beverage sales could account for that high a level of overall losses, referencing Progressive Grocer's 2016 Annual Consumers Expenditure Study that shows soda makes up only four percent of nationwide grocery store sales. But John Stanton, a St. Joe’s professor who’s specialized in food marketing for decades, asserts that Brown's numbers make sense. He said it's unlikely shoppers will substitute their sugary beverages with healthier options. "I just think that’s kind of a ridiculous conclusion to draw," he said, "Now, is it possible that someone is going to say, ‘Let’s buy just two liters of coke?’ It’s not like they’re going to say, ‘Let’s buy fresh carrots with the money we’re going to save,' because the two liters of coke taxed are going to cost as much as the three liters of coke untaxed, so it’s not like they have a lot of extra money." He also says the beverage section is, in general, the most important section for a supermarket. Stores usually display soda and drink products in several areas throughout the store. Their sales tend to make up a large amount of total sales revenue. And, aside from the profit made when shoppers buy the product, supermarkets also make revenue through promotional allowances. That’s when a distributor (say, Pepsi) pays the store to display its product on an end cap, which is the small, outward facing section on the end of an isle. If shoppers at a supermarket start buying less Pepsi, Pepsi gives the supermarket less money in promotional allowances. So, by selling less of a product like Pepsi, the store not only loses sales revenue, but it sacrifices even more revenue from lost promotional allowances. Soda is generally a common product displayed on end caps and thus often contributes to a store's promotional revenue. "Supermarkets rely on these promotional payments," Stanton said. Karen Meleta, a spokesperson for Brown, emphasized that the stores aren't only selling less soda, but they're also selling less of other products the tax covers: some sugary syrups and dairy alternatives like cashew and almond milk. "If all people just stopped buying Coke and Pepsi, we probably would have been fine," she said. But, because of the variety of products now taxed, she said the ShopRite stores are losing thousands of customers to stores outside the city, where the same products are now less expensive. Kenney has insisted sales will rebound to normal levels in time, citing examples from tobacco and liquor taxes, but Stanton objects to that claim, too. He said shoppers are habitual. Once they create a routine, they tend to stick to it. "I have a feeling [Kenney's] not a very good food marketer," he said. And Meleta said though she doesn't know whether sales for beverages not included in the soda tax have increased, if they have, it hasn't leveled out the overall losses. This all explains how the tax may contribute to revenue loss, but what about the discrepancy between layoffs and attrition? Though Brown did mention the possibility of layoffs, Meleta said no employees have been laid off. However, there has been up to a 6,000 hour reduction, and up to 300 employees have since left voluntarily, she said. Stanton said this is a reasonable result of significant decreases in beverage sales. He explained supermarket budgets are driven by revenue. If revenue goes down, there’s very little supermarkets can do other than cut hours. Ultimately, it’s up to management to decide how to distribute hours, whether to decrease hours for a large number of employees or to let some people go in order to pay others a "livable wage." "To me, cutting people’s hours and letting people go, they’re the same thing," Stanton added. Our Ruling What we're judging here isn't the possibility of the beverage tax costing ShopRite stores 15 percent of their total sales or whether that necessitates substantially cutting hours. We're just checking to see if Brown has remained consistent in his explanation of how he is losing employees. Though Brown has distanced himself from his early use of the word "layoff," a Philly.com article from Feb. 23 directly quotes him using it. He never definitively said layoffs were going to happen, but he mentioned the possibility. And on Fox 29, he didn’t deny the possibility of layoffs, he just didn’t use that word. In both cases his explanation was ambiguous. However, when we reached out to Brown to clarify his statements, a spokeswoman for him, Karen Meleta, said he had not made any reference to possibly laying off employees, and that there have been no layoffs to date. So, even if the tax is responsible for reduced profits in Brown's supermarket, causing him to have to cut hours and lose employees, he has clearly been inconsistent in citing layoffs or attrition.

The headline on a Sept. 18, 2017, post on TheLastLineOfDefense.org read, "Breaking: Susan Rice arrested for criminal ‘unmasking’ of Trump officials." The post was flagged by Facebook users as part of the social media website’s efforts to combat fake news. The story said "federal officers" raided her office in Provo, Utah, to gather evidence, and Rice was escorted out in handcuffs. "Rice is expected to be charged with multiple felony counts of espionage and other high crimes, and will be lucky if she ever sees the outside of a prison cell again in her life," the post read. Rice isn’t under arrest, because the story is fake. Every story on TheLastLineOfDefense.org is fake. The site is the creation of a man named Christopher Blair, a liberal troll who has told PolitiFact that he created the fake news outlet in order to post absurd stories that would trick conservative readers. A note at the bottom of the website revealed that "everything on this site is a satirical work of fiction." Its About Us page carried a disclaimer that read, "We present fiction as fact and our sources don’t actually exist." The site has been the source of dozens of claims that get reposted on other sites with no indication the articles are fake. The hook to the story is the real news that Rice had asked the National Security Agency to reveal the names of several senior Trump officials in intelligence reports about the presidential campaign and transition. Rice told U.S. House of Representatives investigators she did so to determine why Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the crown prince of of United Arab Emirates, had visited New York in December 2016, CNN reported. The prince met with former national security adviser Michael Flynn, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and former strategist Steve Bannon at Trump Tower. United Arab Emirates officials did not tell President Barack Obama’s administration the prince was visiting, which broke with diplomatic practice. The country later tried to set up back-channel communications between the Trump White House and Russia. Trump in April had accused Rice of possibly committing a crime by seeking the names of the Trump officials involved, but there’s no evidence that’s the case.

pomt-14364	"North Carolina spends $855 less per student than it did before the Great Recession, and we have one of the lowest per pupil spending levels in the nation."	mostly true	/north-carolina/statements/2016/mar/21/roy-cooper/cooper-says-north-carolinas-education-spending-stu/	Attorney General Roy Cooper, who has won the Democratic nomination to challenge Republican Gov. Pat McCrory, unveiled his education plan March 8. Education is a large chunk of the state budget, and it’s a hot topic for both Republicans and Democrats. Cooper’s plan lays out eight basic goals, and it slams McCrory and the Republican-led General Assembly for cutting taxes rather than putting more money into public schools. The Great Recession began in December 2007 and forced states to slash budgets. North Carolina cut many areas, including K-12 education, and Cooper says funding still hasn’t bounced back. "North Carolina spends $855 less per student than it did before the Great Recession, and we have one of the lowest per pupil spending levels in the nation," Cooper’s plan reads. The question of whether higher per-pupil spending generates better academic results is another debate entirely. For now, we’ll just focus on the numbers. So does Cooper ace this math problem? Or will his former teachers want to dock him points for his statement? It turns out that like many claims about education funding, it’s complicated – especially the part about "$855 less." One of the country’s lowest spending levels First, the easy part. Does North Carolina spend less per student than most states? The National Education Association, a teacher’s union that has been tracking all sorts of public school funding data for 70 years, says yes. It reported North Carolina’s per-pupil spending was $8,615 in 2007 (compared with a national average of $9,663). It was $8,867 in 2008 (national average $10,259), and $8,632 in 2014 (national average $11,355). Those numbers show North Carolina has been falling further behind the national average. NEA’s 2015-16 report isn’t out yet, but in 2014-15 it ranked North Carolina 46th out of 51, counting all the states and Washington, D.C., in per-pupil expenditure. That backs up Cooper’s claim that "we have one of the lowest per pupil spending levels in the nation." A U.S. Census Bureau report on 2013 per-pupil funding also ranks North Carolina as one of the lowest states. However, the Census hasn’t released more up-to-date numbers. Face value versus inflation However, those NEA numbers show North Carolina’s per-pupil spending is actually higher than it was in 2007 and only slightly lower than in 2008, certainly not $855 lower. So what about Cooper’s claim that North Carolina spends $855 less per student than before the recession? First let’s define two terms: real dollars and nominal dollars. Nominal value refers to a number’s face value. Real value is the inflation-adjusted figure. Cooper appears at first glance to reference nominal dollars. In that case, he would be wrong. But even though he didn’t mention inflation, the numbers Cooper cited did account for it. And that’s important, because inflation has risen by about 10 percent since the recession began, according to the federal government’s CPI Inflation Calculator. For example, if you made $40,000 in 2008 and didn’t make at least $44,034.14 in 2015, you’re facing the same type of hurt that Cooper is talking about here – not a cut per se, but a loss of purchasing power nonetheless. Cooper’s campaign pointed us to the source of his claim, a report from the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities that did find an inflation-adjusted drop of $855 per student since the recession. But that report was from October 2014 – about 17 months ago. There’s an updated report from this January which shows that in the past year, North Carolina has been moving closer to pre-recession numbers. In fact, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said North Carolina’s increase from 2014 to 2015 was the fifth-largest in the country in terms of percent change. Other numbers and sources Unsatisfied with the report from 2014, we looked at some more recent numbers. It turns out that depending on whether you count total funding or just state funding, Cooper’s claim – though based on outdated numbers – is still right in the middle of the range. Using state numbers from the Department of Public Instruction and combined state, federal and local numbers from the National Education Association, we adjusted the 2008 numbers for inflation. Then we compared it with the most recent available data, which was 2015 for the state and 2014 for all sources combined. The combined per-pupil spending is down $1,118. State spending by itself is down $481. So Cooper’s claim of "$855 less" is right in the middle of that range. Our ruling Cooper is right that North Carolina is one of the states that spends the least per student. When citing the actual amount he used a report that, while not inaccurate, was outdated. And more context and transparency would’ve been helpful. But Cooper is still right in the general sense that North Carolina’s public schools have less purchasing power than before the recession, and that almost every other state spends more money on education per student than North Carolina. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Roy Cooper	None	None	None	2016-03-21T16:38:23	2016-03-08	['None']
pomt-01468	"We have a goal of 10 percent of [City of Providence] contracts going to women and minority businesses. In reality, less than 1 percent of contracts go to women and minority businesses."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2014/oct/01/jorge-elorza/elorza-says-less-1-providence-contracts-go-women-m/	During a debate last month on Latino Public Radio with Michael Solomon, then his opponent for the Democratic nomination for Providence mayor, Jorge Elorza said that if elected he would do more to support minority- and women-owned businesses in Rhode Island’s capital. "We have a goal of 10 percent of city contracts going to women and minority businesses," he said, referring to a City of Providence initiative. "In reality, less than 1 percent of contracts go to women and minority businesses." Elorza’s statement came on Aug. 28, before he went on to beat Solomon in the Sept. 9 primary. He now faces independent Vincent A. "Buddy" Cianci Jr. and Republican Daniel Harrop in the November general election to succeed Angel Taveras as mayor. Elorza has made the awarding of city contracts an issue in his campaign. He first made a claim about the lack of contracts going to minorities and women in an April 16 post to his campaign website that announced his "Equity in Business Opportunity" proposal. In that statement, he said the figure stood at "approximately 1%." Has Providence really fallen so far short of its goal in awarding contracts to minorities and women? While we waited for Elorza’s campaign to provide the basis for the claim, we found the city ordinance from 1990 that set goals for minority and women contracts. The ordinance is actually more ambitious than what Elorza described. It has goals of 10 percent of contracts for minorities and 10 percent for women, or 20 percent total -- double the percentage Elorza cited. Charles Newton, of the Rhode Island Minority Business Enterprise, pointed this out to us. Taveras’s office confirmed it. The ordinance notes that in 1990 and in the two previous years, less than 1 percent of contracts went to such firms. (In the Providence Code of Ordinances, see Chapter 21, Article II, Section 21-52.) When John Taraborelli, a spokesman for Elorza, got back to us, he said Elorza’s statement about the low percentage of contracts awarded to minorities and women was based on a 2013 GoLocalProv story. That story reviewed minutes of all the meetings held by the Providence Board of Contract and Supply from Jan. 1 to Dec. 31, 2012. Of $185.8 million awarded in contracts in 2012, only $1.6 million -- less than 1 percent -- went to companies owned by minorities, according to the story. Taraborelli also said the campaign followed up with Brian Hull, Providence’s Director of municipal and intergovernmental affairs. Hull said the analysis of the 2012 numbers was accurate, according to Taraborelli. We spoke with Hull ourselves and he brought up several caveats when trying to analyze city contracts and also gave us more up-to-date figures. First, the caveats. Not all city contracts go before the Board of Contract and Supply. The board reviews and authorizes city purchases of $5,000 or more. Anything less than $5,000 is put out to bid by city departments, so those smaller contracts aren’t included in the records of the board. In addition, for businesses to be considered as owned by minorities or women they must be certified by the state. However, not all businesses that could qualify decide to go through the certification process, which can be lengthy, said Hull. If those non-certified firms get city contracts, they aren’t counted as owned by minorities or women. Now for the updated number. After Mayor Taveras took office in 2011, his administration formed a task force to bump up the number of contracts awarded to minority firms and studied innovative purchasing programs in other cities, including San Antonio, Texas and Bridgeport, Conn. The efforts resulted in an increase. For 2013, the share of contracts awarded by the Board of Contract and Supply to minority- or women-owned businesses stood at 2.3 percent of the $208 million in purchases that year, according to an analysis done by Hull’s office. That’s about triple the equivalent figure of 0.8 percent for 2012. To put the Providence number in perspective, we talked to Newton, the assistant administrator of the Rhode Island Minority Business Enterprise, the state agency that certifies minority businesses. The state has a requirement of 10 percent of all purchasing going to minority or women businesses. That share currently stands at between 4.5 and 5 percent, according to Newton. Our ruling Jorge Elorza said that Providence has a goal of awarding 10 percent of city contracts to businesses owned by minorities or women, but that in reality less than 1 percent of contracts go to such firms. Elorza got both parts of the claim wrong. The goal is actually 10 percent for minorities and 10 percent for women, for a total of 20 percent. And the latest figures show that, in 2013, 2.3 percent of city contracts went to minorities, more than double the outdated 2012 figure Elorza cited. The difference in the 2012 figure and the 2013 figure is large when the numbers are considered in relation to each other. However, even though there has been an increase, 2.3 percent is still well short of the 20-percent goal. Elorza’s larger point -- that the city needs to act aggressively if it wants to meet policy goals in how it awards contracts-- may be valid, but the numbers he uses to support that claim are way off. We rule his statement Mostly False. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at politifact@providencejournal.com. And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)

pomt-09196	Bill McCollum on the Arizona immigration law.	full flop	/florida/statements/2010/may/27/bill-mccollum/bill-mccollum-sends-mixed-signals-arizonas-immigra/	Arizona's controversial immigration law has proven problematic for Florida Republicans, who in large part appear wary of fully endorsing a proposal that's supported by a majority of Floridians but one that also could cost votes among Florida's Hispanic population. The tightrope-walking act is perhaps no more apparent than when it comes to Attorney General Bill McCollum, a Republican running for governor. McCollum's primary opponent , Rick Scott, unabashedly supports the law, which will require local law enforcement officials, once police stop a person, to verify the immigration status of those they reasonably suspect of being in the country illegally. The law is also supported by a 58 percent of Floridians, according to a May 2010 St. Petersburg Times/Miami Herald/Bay News 9/Central Florida News 13 poll. We decided to rate McCollum's statements on the Arizona law using our Flip-O-Meter, which measures how consistent someone has been when taking a position on an issue. Before we get to that, though, we need to give you a quick history of how the Arizona law came to pass. The bill in question originally was signed into law on April 23, 2010, by Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer. An amended version of the bill -- one to lessen the prospects that racial profiling could occur -- passed and was signed into law on April 30. The new version of the law says: "A law enforcement official or agency of this state or a county, city, town or other political subdivision of this state may not consider race, color or national origin in implementing the requirements of this subsection except to the extent permitted by the United States or Arizona Constitution." The prior version had said that an official "may not solely consider race" in such circumstances. The change in the bill -- though its impact can be debated -- is important to note when discussing McCollum's position, since his first comments refer to the first version of the bill, while later comments refer to the second version. McCollum's first published comments about the Arizona law came on April 27, after the original bill had passed. He was asked whether he would like a Florida version of Arizona's law. "I think Arizona has its own unique problems," McCollum said. "I don't think Florida should enact laws like this -- quite that far out." Then in stories on May 13 and May 14 -- after the amended version of Arizona's law passed -- McCollum about-faced and said he would support a Florida version. "As state and local law enforcement officials in Arizona begin to implement the state's aggressive new border security law to crackdown on illegal immigration, I applaud Gov. Brewer and the Arizona Legislature for stepping up their enforcement efforts at a time when President Obama's administration has let states down," McCollum said. "I support Arizona's law as amended, and if the federal government fails to secure our borders and solve the problem of illegal immigration, I would support a similar law for Florida." And he also said: "Arizona leaders recently made needed changes that address concerns I had that the law could be abused and misused to perform racially profiled stops and arrests. I do not support any measure that would result in racial profiling or other unintended consequences for law-abiding American citizens.'' Then, on May 16, came another comment to a television reporter in Port St. Lucie. This time, McCollum said he didn't think an Arizona-style immigration law was needed in Florida. "I didn't change my position, but Arizona changed its law after they passed a law that was very bad (and) that had that the potential for racial profiling," McCollum said. He was then asked if it was realistic that a similar law might be passed in Florida. "We don't need that law in Florida," he said. "That's not what's going to happen here." McCollum's most recent comments were picked up on by the Scott campaign, which highlighted the quote in a television ad. McCollum called the original version of the Arizona immigration law far out, but then said he would support the amended law being adopted in Florida. Since there's a debate over how much difference the amendment ultimately will have in how the law is enforced, it's hard for us to properly measure whether McCollum's position shift in this instance is a complete flip-flop. But what does strike us are McCollum's comments on May 13 and May 16 -- both in reference to the amended version. On May 13, McCollum said he would support implementing the Arizona law in Florida. Then on May 16 he said Florida doesn't need that law. Which is it? McCollum spokeswoman Kristy Campbell said McCollum's position since the final version of the law passed has been consistent. She says McCollum supports the law Arizona passed, in large part because of failures at the federal level. However, McCollum thinks an Arizona-style law is not currently needed in Florida because of the state's unique issues dealing with immigration. But McCollum's statements to the media on May 13 and May 16 are just too different to us, and warrant a rating of Full-Flop.

pomt-04405	Says Barack Obama began his presidency "with an apology tour."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/17/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-barack-obama-began/	The notion that President Barack Obama started his presidency with an "apology tour" is a persistent and false Republican talking point that we have debunked a number of times. Mitt Romney is sticking to it. The Republican presidential nominee repeated it during his second debate against Obama at Hofstra University on Oct. 16, 2012, in response to an audience member’s question about the September 2012 Libya attack. "The president's policies throughout the Middle East began with an apology tour and pursue a strategy of leading from behind, and this strategy is unraveling before our very eyes," he said. We checked Romney’s "apology" attack when he used it at the Republican National Convention and in his 2010 book, No Apology: The Case for American Greatness. The tour, he wrote, is Obama’s way "of signaling to foreign countries and foreign leaders that their dislike for America is something he understands and that is, at least in part, understandable. There are anti-American fires burning all across the globe; President Obama's words are like kindling to them." "In his first nine months in office, President Obama has issued apologies and criticisms of America in speeches in France, England, Turkey, and Cairo; at the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, the National Archives in Washington, D.C., and the United Nations in New York City. He has apologized for what he deems to be American arrogance, dismissiveness, and derision; for dictating solutions, for acting unilaterally, and for acting without regard for others; for treating other countries as mere proxies, for unjustly interfering in the internal affairs of other nations, and for feeding anti-Muslim sentiments; for committing torture, for dragging our feet on global warming and for selectively promoting democracy." An early apology tour? Romney labels seven separate Obama speeches as apologies in his book. (We've compiled those passages in a separate document.) We noticed Obama tended to acknowledge American mistakes or bad impressions, but he countered it with praise of American ideals and the need to come together. At a town hall meeting in France in 2009, for example, Obama encouraged Europe to work with the United States, and admitted that the United States "has shown arrogance and been dismissive, even derisive." But he immediately said that Europe has been guilty of a "casual" and "insidious" anti-Americanism. At a major address to the United Nations, Obama said, "I took office at a time when many around the world had come to view America with skepticism and distrust. Part of this was due to misperceptions and misinformation about my country. Part of this was due to opposition to specific policies, and a belief that on certain critical issues, America has acted unilaterally, without regard for the interests of others. And this has fed an almost reflexive anti-Americanism, which too often has served as an excuse for collective inaction." At a speech in Cairo on relations between the U.S. and the Islamic world, Obama got very close to regretting decades-old U.S. actions in Iran. But then he immediately countered with criticism of Iran. He suggested both countries simply "move forward." Throughout those speeches, Obama was most conciliatory when talking about torture and detention at the U.S. military installation at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Obama typically said the U.S. must always stay true to its ideals, and that's why he "unequivocally prohibited the use of torture by the United States, and I have ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed by early next year." Apologies or diplomacy? We asked several experts in 2010 if Obama had apologized. Here’s a recap of their thoughts (read more here): • Nile Gardiner, a foreign policy analyst with the the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Obama was definitely apologizing. He co-wrote an analysis on the topic: "Barack Obama's Top 10 Apologies: How the President Has Humiliated a Superpower." "Apologizing for your own country projects an image of weakness before both allies and enemies," Gardiner said. "It sends a very clear signal that the U.S. is to blame for some major developments on the world stage. This can be used to the advantage of those who wish to undermine American global leadership." • John Murphy, a communications professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, studies presidential rhetoric and political language. He said Obama used conciliatory language for diplomatic purposes, not apologizing. "It's much more a sense of establishing of reciprocity," Murphy said. "Each side says, okay, we haven't done great, but we have a new president and we're going to make a fresh start and move forward. I don't think that's an apology." • Lauren Bloom, an attorney and business consultant, wrote the book, The Art of the Apology, advising businesses and individuals on when to apologize and how to do it. She said Obama's words fell short of an apology, mostly because he didn't use the words "sorry" or "regret." "I think to make an effective apology, the words 'I'm sorry' or 'we're sorry' always have to be there," Bloom said. Obama's remarks were really non-apologies, and they're not good in business or personal relationships, Bloom said. The one area where they can be useful: international diplomacy. "Gov. Romney is trying to appeal to the inner John Wayne of his readers, and that has a certain emotional appeal," Bloom said. "For the rest of us, a level assessment of less-than-perfect human behavior is perfectly reasonable." • We spoke with Rhoda E. Howard-Hassmann, a professor who tracked international human rights issues via the website Political Apologies and Reparations. Many of the apologies in the database relate to genocide or slavery. "To say the United States will not torture is not an apology, it is a statement of intent," Howard-Hassman said. "A complete apology has to acknowledge something was wrong, accept responsibility, express sorrow or regret and promise not to repeat it." Obama's Cairo address in particular was a means of reaching out to the Islamic world, not an acknowledgement of wrongdoing, she said. "Whether he's apologizing or not, he's saying 'I respect your society and I respect your customs.' Maybe that's what Romney considers an apology, that gesture of respect," she said. "But a gesture of respect is not an apology." We should note that Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have offered two apologies to foreign leaders during the latter half of Obama’s term -- once to Afghanistan President Harmid Karzai for the accidental burnings of the Quran, the holy book of Islam, and another to Pakistan for the death of Pakistani troops, respectively. However, these 2012 and 2011 gestures do not fit Romney’s claim that Obama’s presidency "began with an apology tour." Our ruling Once again, Romney has accused Obama of beginning his presidency "with an apology tour." Our reviews of Obama’s 2009 foreign travels and speeches showed no such thing. While he criticized past U.S. actions, such as torture practices at Guantanamo, he did not offer one apology. It’s ridiculous to call Obama’s foreign visits and remarks "an apology tour."

pomt-12665	Says Airbnb "decreases real estate values and increases costs for workforce housing."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2017/mar/20/philip-levine/does-airbnb-decrease-housing-values-and-increase-w/	Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine went on a Facebook rant against Airbnb after a conservative publication criticized city officials for supporting fines against the short-term rental company. Airbnb posted the article by Sunshine State News on social media. Levine, a potential Democratic candidate for governor in 2018, fired back in the comments. Levine wrote that Miami Beach commissioners aren’t the only opponents of Airbnb, which allows property owners to rent out houses and apartments, or a bedroom, to visitors across the world. The city generally bans short-term rentals except in limited multi-family areas. He said officials in New York, San Francisco and Miami also don’t support Airbnb. Why? "Because it destroys neighborhoods, buildings, decreases real estate values and increases costs for workforce housing!!!!!" he wrote in a March 2 Facebook comment. We decided to tackle two of Levine’s attacks: that Airbnb decreases real estate values and increases costs for workforce housing. (By workforce housing, Levine was referring to homes for people who earn 60 to 120 percent of an area’s median income.) Airbnb does remove some units from the regular supply of rentals; however, it’s questionable about whether that can be defined as "workforce housing" since many units are in expensive areas. The evidence that Levine presented does not show that Airbnb decreases real estate values. Several factors influence housing costs, even in areas with Airbnb and where rents are rising. Jack McCabe, a South Florida real estate analyst, said it’s premature to make broad claims about the impact of Airbnb because it hasn’t been around for long and only represents a slice of the residential market. "It's still too soon to really have data for a long enough period of time to make these types of assumptions or assertions," he said. Some real estate experts said that Airbnb is the latest scapegoat for the lack of available affordable rentals — a problem that predated the home-sharing company. Levine’s evidence largely anecdotal Definitive, independent analysis about the impact of Airbnb is generally lacking. Most of the research we found focused on one city, or ones that were already plagued by housing crunches. For example, a San Francisco official said that "illegitimate rentals" took out 1,900 long-term housing units off the market, but it isn’t clear how many of those were affordable for people earning median incomes or less. Levine sent us multiple articles about the impact of Airbnb on housing — some of the articles were anecdotal, speculative or general news reports about Airbnb’s growth in Miami Beach. We will focus on the evidence he sent that included studies based on data. A 2015 study by the Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy, an advocacy group for working families, concluded Airbnb was exacerbating the lack of affordable rental units in Los Angeles. The group also did a 2014 study that found rents were growing faster in Los Angeles neighborhoods with the highest Airbnb listing density. Roy Samaan, the author of the studies, told PolitiFact that he couldn’t definitively say that Airbnb was the cause of rents increasing. Several factors influence rental costs. There was a strong correlation, he said, between rising rents and increased Airbnb listings when the vacancy rate was really low. Since Airbnb doesn’t make its booking information fully public, it’s difficult to fully assess the impact. Another piece of evidence Levine cited stemmed from a report commissioned by affordable housing activists in New York City. It concluded that short-term rentals are reducing the vacancy rate, which causes increases in rental prices. The study zeroed in on a subset of about 8,000 Airbnb listings in New York City and concluded if those units were put back on the regular market, the vacancy rate would rise from the current 3.4-3.6 percent to 4 percent. Richard K. Green, a real estate professor at the University of Southern California, told PolitiFact those 8,000 units would be absorbed quickly in a rental market of more than 2.2 million units. "I am skeptical that the local vacancy rates would move as much as the authors of the New York study would suggest," he said. Airbnb fires back It did not come as a surprise when Airbnb argued through its own packet of articles and studies that its listings don’t hurt real estate values or supply. Again, we will focus on the citations based on data. A FiveThirtyEight analysis concluded that "Airbnb’s impact is probably still small in most cities," although it could grow. The statistics-based news website used Airbnb booking and revenue data to examine how many units Airbnb could be taking off the rental market nationwide. Stockton Williams, executive director of the Terwilliger Center for Housing at the Urban Land Institute, told FiveThirtyEight that the Airbnb units don’t add up to much as a percentage of total rental units in big cities in the United States. Other factors, such as the increasing demand for urban living, have played a much larger role in driving up prices in big cities, he said. "There is a considerable amount of anecdotal evidence that they may be occurring in a relatively small number of individual neighborhoods and properties — and therefore quite real to affected residents and owners," Williams told us. Murray Cox, owner of Inside Airbnb, a website that analyzes data about Airbnb listings, told Business Insider that Airbnb can’t entirely be blamed for housing issues in cities that were already expensive. Cox told PolitiFact the research reflects a mixed bag: Some homes have been removed from the housing supply, but the additional revenue for property owners can increase the property value for owners. Airbnb rentals that become "party houses" could reduce neighboring values, but Cox said he hadn’t seen detailed analysis about that. Additional real estate experts argued that short-term rentals, while displacing long-term renters, could increase cash flow for owners and therefore increase their property value. Green, the real estate professor at the University of Southern California, said that focusing on Airbnb doesn’t get to the heart of the matter — "that cities are making it more and more difficult to build housing." Our ruling Levine says Airbnb "decreases real estate values and increases costs for workforce housing." Some research and news articles have argued that Airbnb has decreased the rental supply and therefore is driving up prices, but it’s questionable whether all of those units can be described as "workforce housing" in already expensive areas with a lack of affordable housing. Levine did not point to evidence proving that Airbnb has decreased real estate values. It’s too soon to fully assess the impact of Airbnb on housing markets, and that’s difficult to do when it only represents a small fraction of the housing supply in any city or region.

pomt-14664	"One in every three women has an abortion during her lifetime."	half-true	/texas/statements/2016/jan/19/wendy-davis/flawed-wendy-davis-claim-1-3-women-has-had-abortio/	Former Fort Worth state Sen. Wendy Davis, the 2014 Democratic gubernatorial nominee, wants the Supreme Court to reverse the Texas law that critics say will make it harder for far-flung Texans to access abortions. Republicans who carried the changes into law said their goal was to improve women’s health by requiring abortion doctors to gain admitting privileges in a nearby hospital and requiring abortions to be performed in hospital-like settings. Abortion providers sued, arguing the regulations — impossible for many clinics to meet — were unnecessary because they offered no health benefits for a relatively low-risk procedure. Davis, joined by women with legislative experience who, like Davis, have revealed decisions to terminate pregnancies, said in the Jan. 4, 2016, brief that the law could affect women in need if it’s allowed to be enforced by leaving about 10 clinics operating in the state’s largest cities—down from more than 40 when House Bill 2 was signed into law in 2013. In the brief, the women say they’re "grateful that they were able to exercise their rights in nearby doctor’s offices and abortion clinics without the burdens of travel, delay and additional expense that would be imposed on Texas women if HB 2 were to remain in force." Generally, the brief says, false "stereotypes persist in society and in state legislatures regarding women who exercise their right to choose. The reality is that approximately one out of every three women in this country has had an abortion in her lifetime." The brief later says: "One in every three women has an abortion during her lifetime." A reader asked us to check that "lifetime" statement. Nationally in 2011, an estimated 1.1 million abortions were performed, down nearly 14 percent from 2008, according to a March 2014 article by the New York-based Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit that promotes reproductive health and abortion rights. The 2011 estimate broke out to 16.9 abortions for every 1,000 women aged 15-44, the researchers wrote. To our inquiry, Davis told us by email that Linda Goldstein, among lawyers who drafted the brief, had advised that, as footnoted in the brief, a 1998 Guttmacher study was the basis of the one-in-three statement. In a follow-up email, Davis said the 1998 study was a precursor to a more recent estimate, in a 2011 Guttmacher study, that one in three women will have an abortion by age 45. Separately, Michael New, a visiting associate professor at Florida’s Ave Maria University who has questioned the prevalence of abortions, responded to our inquiry by pointing out a September 2015 story by the FactChecker at The Washington Post that found flaws in a claim that one in three women will have an abortion "by the age of 45." The Post story explains the purpose of the 2011 Guttmacher report was to update older estimates that 43 percent of women of reproductive age would have an abortion by age 45. The abortion rate had declined over intervening years, the story notes, and researchers hypothesized that the proportion of women who will have an abortion during their lifetime also probably declined. The study used abortion rates (the number of abortions per 1,000 women) for subgroups of women (including age, socioeconomic status, race and ethnicity) who responded to the institute’s 2008 Abortion Patient Survey of nearly 9,500 women, the Post summed up. Next, researchers used survey data to find the first abortion rate for age subgroups, multiplied the rate by the number of years in each age group and added up the number of first-time abortions that had taken place by the time women were 45. This was called the "cumulative first abortion rate," through which they came up with the "lifetime incidence" of abortion, or the "one in three" figure, the Post reported. To grasp the basis of Davis’s claim, we turned first to the 1998 study footnoted in the brief and then the 2011 follow-up. 1998 study The December 1998 study, "Unintended Pregnancy in the United States," by Stanley K. Henshaw, then the institute’s deputy director of research, offers estimates for the incidence of abortions in 1994--more than 20 years ago. A Guttmacher summary says Henshaw drew on national surveys of women taken in 1982, 1988 and 1995 plus other data to estimate 1994 rates and percentages of unintended birth and pregnancy and the proportion of women who had experienced an unintended birth, an abortion or both. The study itself describes the cited National Surveys of Family Growth as a "periodic fertility survey" that collects detailed reproductive and contraceptive histories and related information from women of reproductive age. "Forty-eight percent of women aged 15-44 in 1994 had had at least one unplanned pregnancy sometime in their lives," Henshaw wrote, "28% had had one or more unplanned births, 30% had had one or more abortions and 11% had had both." Put another way, then, the study suggested that as of 1994, nearly one third of women of childbearing age had had an abortion. The likelihood of women having had an abortion varied by age. A chart indicates some 40 percent of women aged 30-34 in 1994 had had one or more abortions; at the low end, 7 percent of women aged 15-19 had had one or more abortions. SOURCE: Study, "Unintended Pregnancy in the United States," S.K. Henshaw, the Guttmacher Institute, December 1998 (accessed Jan. 12, 2016) The summary continues: "At 1994 rates, women can expect to have 1.42 unintended pregnancies by the time they are 45, and at 1992 rates, 43% of women will have had an abortion." The study says "14% of women can expect to have had an abortion before age 20, 37% by age 30 and 43% by age 45." 2011 study notes declining abortion rate Rebecca Wind, a Guttmacher spokeswoman, responded to our request for elaboration with an email stating: "The stat Wendy Davis cited was correct a few years ago; as abortion rates have declined, so have lifetime incidence rates." Wind guided us to the 2011 study, "Changes in Abortion Rates Between 2000 and 2008 and Lifetime Incidence of Abortion," which notes the U.S. "abortion rate has declined since 1992, and the proportion of women who will terminate a pregnancy in their lifetime has probably declined as well." The authors analyzed abortion rates from 2000 through 2008 and estimated the proportion of women of reproductive age "who will have an abortion by age 45." Women "aged 40 and older had" an abortion "rate of 300.9 per 1,000 women," the study says. "Put differently, an estimated 30.1% of women aged 15–44 in 2008 will have an abortion by age 45 if exposed to prevailing abortion rates throughout their reproductive lives," it says. "Similarly, an estimated 8.3% of U.S. women would have had an abortion by age 20 and 25.1% by age 30." Broadly, the study notes, the "proportion of women expected to have an abortion by age 45 declined substantially, from 43% in 1992 to 30% in 2008 and this pattern parallels the substantial decline in abortion rates during that time period. "Still, that almost one-third of women are anticipated to have an abortion by age 45 suggests that it is not an uncommon procedure," the study says. The study closes by saying that if "current" abortion rates hold, "almost one-third of American women will obtain an abortion in their lifetime." To our inquiry, Guttmacher scientist Rachel Jones told us by email that Davis’s statement referring to all women was incorrect "because it implied that a random sample of women in 2016 would find that 30% of them would have had an abortion. Our stat is the projected lifetime incidence of abortion among women in 2008 by the time they turn 45. (That is, lots of women currently aged 15-44 have not had abortions but many will before they exit their reproductive years.)" Jones added: "We know that the abortion rate has dropped substantially since 2008, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the lifetime incidence has. There also have to be concomitant changes in age-specific first-abortion rates." She said that until 2014 data is analyzed, likely in 2017, it’s only appropriate to say that given 2008 abortion rates, "an estimated 30% of women will have an abortion by age 45." Other analyses We heard back from a couple of activists opposed to abortion including New, who emphasized Guttmacher’s 2011 analysis was retrospective, drawing on 2008 abortion data, while there may continue to be fewer U.S. abortions year by year. "The abortion rate," New said by email, "has been falling consistently since the early 1980s and continues to fall," especially among teens and young adults, he emailed, which might mean, if trends continue, that women in general will be less likely to have an abortion. Chuck Donovan, president of the Charlotte Lozier Institute, the research arm of the Susan B. Anthony List, an organization dedicated to ending abortion, provided a statement by email noting that a physicist, William Johnston, has estimated that as of 2008, about 28 percent of U.S. women aged 15-64 had had abortions--up from 2.8 percent in 1973, the year the Supreme Court established a woman's constitutional right to end a pregnancy. Our ruling Davis said: "One in every three women has an abortion during her lifetime." That statement is a bit misleading in that it sounds like it is based on hard data showing one in three women have had abortions. Of late, the statistic is based on extrapolations of 2008 data analyzed by the Guttmacher Institute in an effort to estimate how many women will have an abortion during their reproductive years. Meantime, abortion rates have generally declined so it’s possible such estimates don’t reflect reality. We rate this claim, which is missing important qualifications, Half True.

pomt-03633	Metro on whether it could use bond money for restoration.	full flop	/oregon/statements/2013/may/04/metro/did-metro-flip-flop-whether-it-could-use-bond-mone/	The voters of Washington, Multnomah and Clackamas counties will decide May 21, 2013, whether to approve a 5-year operating levy for Metro, the regional government that oversees growth and also runs the Oregon Zoo. Measure 26-152 would raise approximately $10 million a year from an increase in property taxes, half of which would go toward restoration of natural areas. Metro officials say the measure is necessary because general obligation bond measures approved by voters in 1995 and in 2006 allowed the government to purchase land, but didn’t provide money to restore and maintain the new land. "Twice in two decades, Metro voters approved measures to acquire thousands of acres of natural areas throughout the tri-county region," reads the Voters’ Pamphlet summary of this spring’s Measure 26-152. "Past measures could not include money for maintenance and restoration." Which got PolitiFact Oregon thinking. We remembered how the 2006 measure was pitched to voters. The language of Measure 26-80, also in the Voters’ Pamphlet, was clear: "This measure directs Metro to buy and restore natural areas for the protection of water quality and preservation of fish and wildlife habitat ..." Metro officials wrote both statements in the Voters’ Pamphlet. Voters overwhelmingly approved the $227 million bond measure in 2006, probably thinking that the money would go toward both purchase and actual restoration, because that’s what supporters said they’d do. Did Metro use the promise of restoration to sell the 2006 measure? Why is it now saying that the 2006 money couldn’t be used for restoration? Has Metro flip-flopped on what the 2006 bond could and could not do? We shot off an email to Metro spokesman Jim Middaugh and started digging. For people who don’t follow the scintillating world of public finance, just know that government can sell general obligation bonds -- and take on debt -- to pay for capital projects and improvements. Governments do it all the time. Governments do not, however, tend to incur long-term debt for operational expenses, such as routine maintenance or payroll. That’s poor fiscal policy, and that is the distinction Metro is making with the different measures. So the first question for us is: Can money from bonds be used for restoration, despite what Metro now says? This description of general obligation debt -- found on the state Treasury website -- indicates that the answer is yes. "Under ORS 287A.050 - 287A.145 general obligation debt can be incurred for capital construction and improvements having an expected useful life of more than one year. This does not include maintenance and repair (the need for which could be reasonably anticipated), supplies, and equipment that are not intrinsic to a structure." PolitiFact Oregon can see how restoration of purchased property could count as an improvement lasting for more than year. And certainly, Metro officials saw it that way because they sold it that way. Still, Metro draws a distinction between restoration spending then and restoration spending now. Middaugh said that despite the state description, the agency has its own guidelines on how to spend bonded money. For example, Metro used bonded money for the initial "stabilization" part of restoration, defined as "one-time activities performed during the first two to five years after" land purchase. Mowing grass, killing weeds and removing trash is OK so long as the activities take place during this phase -- but afterward, those actions are considered maintenance. Why wasn’t this distinction called out in public materials? The description was too wonky, he said, so they went with the more conversational "restoration" and "protection." Half of the money from this operating levy would go toward operations and education, and the other half to continued restoration of natural areas. Out of curiosity, we asked if Metro had planned all along to come back to voters for more money. The answer was yes, and the proof is on page 9 of the resolution authorizing the 2006 measure, stating that Metro would only have enough money to manage new lands for a limited time. All we can say to these disclosures is that we wish Metro had been utterly transparent and upfront -- both about long-term funding plans and definitions -- with voters from the beginning. PolitiFact Oregon loves nature and we love good governance. We don’t want public bodies borrowing money recklessly, and we trust our elected officials to make that distinction. But here we have a government that sold an earlier measure as a way to buy and restore natural areas and that now says officials couldn’t use that money for restoration. Yet there is no legal prohibition on using bond proceeds for restoration. In fact, Metro has spent nearly $5 million to do so, even if staffers call it something else. The bottom line is that both statements come from the Voters' Pamphlet and both were written by Metro officials. And both statements can’t be right. Metro wants more money to further nurture its new natural areas. Metro wants money for boat ramps and better playgrounds that should improve use of visitor areas. We don’t fault the wishes. But we do fault Metro for saying one thing, then another, about whether restoration was part of the plan in 2006 and why more money is needed in 2013. This is a reversal of position by Oregon’s tri-county regional government. We rule this a Full Flop.	None	Metro	None	None	None	2013-05-04T03:00:00	2013-04-24	['None']
pomt-14289	Says Bernie Sanders "fundamentally changed the lives" of Immokalee farm workers in Florida for the better.	half-true	/florida/statements/2016/apr/05/bernie-sanders/did-bernie-sanders-fundamentally-improve-lives-tom/	Bernie Sanders says he successfully changed the lives of exploited tomato workers in Florida. In an ad for Sanders, which ran nationally on Univision, U.S. Rep. Raúl Grijalva, D-Ariz., praises Sanders for taking up the plight of Immokalee tomato workers. "He went and visited personally. Then he came back and convinced Ted Kennedy to hold some hearings, and it fundamentally changed the lives of those workers." There is no dispute that Sanders, a Vermont senator, was a passionate defender of the tomato workers from Central Florida in 2008. A coalition representing those workers successfully reached an agreement with the growers about two years later to improve pay and working conditions. But how much credit does Sanders get, and has the agreement "fundamentally changed" the workers’ lives? Sanders’ advocacy on behalf of Immokalee farm workers in 2008 In 2008, Sanders traveled to meet with the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, which represented thousands of tomato workers. "The conditions here are a disaster. People are being exploited ruthlessly," Sanders said. Since the coalition couldn’t reach an agreement with the Florida Tomato Growers Exchange directly, it negotiated with purchasers of tomatoes, asking them to pay a penny-per-pound increase. Yum Brands -- parent of Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and KFC -- signed on in 2005, and McDonald’s in 2007, and more would later follow. Sanders, along with a few other senators, sent letters to food chains and grocery stores urging them to join the campaign, said Warren Gunnels, a spokesman for Sanders’ presidential campaign. Sanders also met with a representative of the growers’ exchange. On March 13, 2008, Sanders held a press conference on the U.S. Capitol grounds to support a nationwide petition drive on behalf of farm workers. He invited the coalition to testify before a Senate committee in April 2008. "In the United States of America, millions of workers are being forced into a race to the bottom," Sanders testified. "What we have in the tomato fields of Florida are workers who are living on the lowest rung of the ladder in that race to the bottom." About two and a half years after the hearing -- in November 2010 -- the coalition and the growers’ exchange reached an agreement. It included the penny-per-pound premium and other steps intended to improve working conditions, such as a system to resolve complaints about sexual abuse as well as a health and safety program. Those involved in the process say Sanders should get some credit for the publicity. The agreement "probably would have occurred anyway at some point, but we think it is fair to say that Sen. Sanders’ efforts accelerated the process," coalition spokesman Steve Hitov told PolitiFact Florida. Reggie Brown, a vice president with the growers’ exchange who met with Sanders in 2008, said, "I think he can be fairly given some credit for having had a role." Giev Kashkooli, political and legislative director at United Farm Workers of America, a group which endorsed Hillary Clinton, says that "it's likely that (Sanders') visit and subsequent work did bring attention to farm workers in Immokalee who deserved support." Impact of agreement There is evidence that the agreement between the coalition and the growers has led to some improvements for workers, but there are differences of opinion about the extent of those improvements. According to the coalition’s most recent annual report, since 2011 the agreement has resulted in nearly $20 million in premiums paid by buyers. Other gains include efforts to reduce sexual assault, the creation of health and safety committees, and resolution of more than 1,000 worker complaints. "The Fair Food Program has brought about unprecedented levels of compliance with human rights standards in the fields," said Laura Safer Espinoza, a retired New York Supreme Court justice who serves as the executive director of the Fair Food Standards Council, which monitors the agreement and audits the growers. The average bucket rate has increased from 40 cents before the agreement to 55 to 65 cents today. But we found no independent research about what that translates to on average per worker, although the coalition cites a range of $30 to $60 per week. Pay is variable due to changing crop conditions and other factors. Greg Schell, an attorney with the Migrant Farmworker Justice Project, has raised some criticisms of the program. He has sued fast food chains on behalf of pickers who he said didn’t get the premium. Since only some purchasers of Florida tomatoes have agreed to pay the premium, not all of the tomatoes a worker picks will include the premium. "The short answer is that the hearings changed nothing whatsoever in Immokalee," he said. "The hearings did provide a national forum for the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, which has for the past 20 years pressed for higher wages for the tomato workers. However, despite immense publicity for its efforts, the coalition’s efforts have resulted in very minimal wage increases to the workers." Schell sent us a pay stub of a worker showing the premium was only $1.21 one week while the coalition sent us a pay stub showing $101.06 for another worker. Both are extremes, says coalition attorney Steve Hitov. A reporter from the Naples Daily News described the tough lives of tomato workers in an article in March. She said "they earn $10 an hour, and that the salaries have changed only a few cents an hour in the past five years." Workers barely earn enough to support their families and live together in trailers. There is no dispute that picking tomatoes remains a tough job, but "there is no comparison between what existed before and what exists now," says Janice Fine, a labor professor at Rutgers, who has interviewed the workers and has met with the coalition and the growers. "In my interviews with farmworkers, they talk about a radical transformation in their work lives," she told PolitiFact Florida. Our ruling Sanders’ ad says he "fundamentally changed the lives" of Immokalee farm workers in Florida. Sanders helped give national publicity to the struggles of Immokalee tomato pickers in 2008. He visited with the workers, wrote letters to tomato purchasers urging them to join a program to pay workers more, met with a representative from the growers exchange and held a Senate hearing in 2008. About two years later, the workers reached an agreement with the growers. The coalition and the growers’ exchange both say Sanders should get some credit, although it’s likely that the agreement could have been reached without his efforts. Whether the agreement "fundamentally changed the lives" of the workers is difficult to quantify. The agreement included an increase for purchasers which goes toward pickers, but it’s unclear on average how many dollars more each picker earns per week as a result of it. There have been other successes in the agreement, including the resolution of worker complaints. We rate this statement Half True.

pomt-01959	"By 2006, the American people were overwhelmingly against the Iraq War."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/20/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-2006-americans-were-overwhelm/	In her recently published memoir Hard Choices, Hillary Clinton acknowledges that "she got it wrong" when she voted to authorize the Iraq War in 2003. As Iraq once again becomes a big news story, as Islamic militants take over large portions of the country’s north and threaten the capital in Baghdad, we thought it would be worth checking one of Clinton’s claims about the American public’s perceptions of the Iraq War. In the seventh chapter of her memoir, Clinton writes that, "by 2006, the American people were overwhelmingly against the Iraq war." Is that correct? We looked at polling data about the war between 2003 and 2006, archived at PollingReport.com. (Here are the ones that fit the criteria for this fact-check.) Initially, Americans felt favorably about the war. While the wording changes somewhat from poll to poll, the level of support for the war was usually at or above two-thirds in mid- March 2003, right before the war began. That month, support hit 70 percent in a Newsweek poll, 64 percent in a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll, 65 percent in an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll and 71 percent in an ABC News/Washington Post poll. In the first few weeks after the attack was launched, support levels went as high as 77 percent in CBS News and Los Angeles Times polls, 78 percent in an ABC News/Washington Post poll and 81 percent in a Fox News poll. However, as the war continued, support began to soften. Eventually, support turned negative in some polls. By mid-May 2004 -- a little over a year after the start of the war -- Time and CNN asked, "Do you approve or disapprove of the way George W. Bush is handling the situation in Iraq?" and found 44 percent approval and 51 percent disapproval. The numbers were similar when the pollsters asked, "In general, do you approve or disapprove of current military policy in Iraq?" Even the Fox News/Opinion Dynamics poll -- which as late as June 2004 found support at 60 percent -- found by February 2005 that a plurality of respondents, 49 percent, said going to war was the "wrong thing" to have done, compared to 46 percent who said it was the "right thing." Disapproval of Bush’s handling of the war reached 58 percent in August 2005 in an Associated Press/Ipsos poll, and it remained roughly the same in a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll in February 2006 and a CNN poll in May 2006. Finally, in the second half of 2006, opposition the war began to hit 2-to-1 margins over support for the war. In July 2006, when CBS and the New York Times asked, "Do you think the result of the war with Iraq was worth the loss of American life and other costs of attacking Iraq, or not?" 63 percent said it was not worth it, compared to just 30 percent who said it was worth it. Then, in November 2006, Time asked about approval of Bush’s handling of Iraq and found 65 percent disapproval and only 31 percent approval. Disapproval continued to rise slightly into 2007. AP found 68 percent disapproval of Bush’s handling of Iraq in January 2007, and CNN/Opinion Research Corporation found 69 percent. So the polling generally tracks with time timeline Clinton offered. The only question is whether disapproval rates in the low-to-mid 60 percent range qualifies as "overwhelming." We were a little skeptical, so we asked some polling experts. "That is an awfully subjective call," said Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School Poll and co-founder of Pollster.com. "I’d be surprised if there were any consensus where that line falls." Mark Blumenthal, the senior polling editor of the Huffington Post and the founding editor of Pollster.com, said the use of "overwhelming" strikes him as subjective, and depends on the context. "What seems like an 'overwhelming' victory margin in a competitive electoral contest might not seem quite as 'overwhelming' in the context of attitudes about a particular policy issue," he said. "I’d guess I’d be OK with 2-to-1 for the former, but 3-to-1 or 4-to-1 for the latter." Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for Clinton, emailed us to say, "In public opinion, if you’re talking about 50-percent-plus opposition on an issue, I think most people would call that ‘overwhelming.’" Vietor added that "the 2006 elections, which went massively in the Democrats’ favor, were viewed as a response to the war." Our ruling Clinton said that, "by 2006, the American people were overwhelmingly against the Iraq war." Polling data shows that roughly 65 percent of the public opposed the war by the second half of 2006, but while that qualifies as strong opposition, the definition of "overwhelming" within the polling profession is more uncertain. On balance, we rate Clinton’s claim Mostly True. UPDATE, June 20, 2014, 11:45 am: This article has been updated to include a response from Clinton's staff received after the story was published.

pomt-08863	Because of violence spreading from Mexico, "you’ve got bullets hitting the city hall in El Paso. You’ve got bombs exploding in El Paso."	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/aug/05/rick-perry/perry-says-violence-mexico-reaching-el-paso-bullet/	Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who has called for President Barack Obama to dispatch more troops to the Texas-Mexico border, told a national TV audience last week that violence in Mexico has seeped into El Paso, across the Rio Grande from troubled Ciudad Juarez. "You’ve got bullets hitting the city hall in El Paso," Perry said in a July 28 interview with Greta Van Susteren of the Fox News Channel. "You’ve got bombs exploding in El Paso." Two days later, Perry spoke in a similar vein during a visit to Laredo. "When a car bomb goes off in El Paso ... we know there's a (security) problem," said Perry, according to KGNS-TV, a Laredo station. The threat of border spillover violence is a simmering topic. In June, for instance, PolitiFact Texas found Barely True U.S. Sen. John Cornyn's statement that spillover violence was "real and escalating." But bullets and bombs in El Paso? Indeed, bullets fired on the Mexico side of the border struck El Paso City Hall on June 29. According to the El Paso Police Department, one bullet traveled through a ninth-floor window and an interior wall before lodging in a picture frame. Stucco walls of the government building were struck by an additional six rounds, the police said. Nobody in El Paso was hurt. "Investigators believe that the rounds may be related to (a shooting incident) that occurred in Juarez," a police department press release said. "El Paso City Hall does not appear to be the specific target of these rounds." Darrel Petry, spokesman for the department, told us the Juarez incident involved an attack on Mexican federal agents. We asked Petry if, as Perry says, bombs are exploding in El Paso. Petry replied: "I am not aware of any bomb going off in El Paso." If that had happened, he said, "I think I would have put the press release out." Perry spokeswoman Katherine Cesinger, responding to our request for information, said in an e-mail that violence in northern Mexico has continued to escalate "and presents a clear and present threat to border communities." She noted that, in the interview with Van Susteren, Perry also mentioned the assassination of a Tamaulipas gubernatorial candidate this summer. Rodolfo Torre Cantu was shot and killed near the airport in that state's capital, Ciudad Victoria, about 200 miles from the Texas border city of Brownsville. As for bombs, Perry "also made reference to a car bomb that was detonated by cartel members a few weeks ago in Juarez just across from El Paso," Cesinger said. On July 15, a car bomb was set off in Ciudad Juarez's downtown, killing several people. The Associated Press quoted authorities saying the July 15 explosion was in retaliation for the arrest of a top leader of the La Linea gang, which works for the Juarez drug cartel. The bomb, which blew up a parked car, was described by the AP as bringing "a new dimension of terror" to the Mexican drug wars. The Washington Post reported: "The assailants drew police and medical workers to the scene by leaving a bound, wounded man in a police uniform near an intersection and then calling in a false report that an officer had been shot." The Post and other news outlets said the bomb was then set off by a cell-phone signal. The Juarez-based U.S. consulate's office closed July 30 "to review its security posture," according to a message posted online by the office. "American citizens are advised avoid the area around the Consulate General until it reopens." In March, a consulate employee and her husband were gunned down as they drove in their car about a block from the U.S.-Mexican border bridge on a major Juarez thoroughfare. All in all, Perry’s correct that bullets coming from across the border hit El Paso’s seat of city government. No bombs have exploded in El Paso, however, though one went off in Juarez.

pomt-12502	"All charter schools are not-for-profit."	half-true	/florida/statements/2017/apr/27/bob-cortes/are-all-florida-charter-schools-not-profit/	Florida lawmakers who support the expansion of charter schools have adopted a single talking point to explain how the schools are managed. Rep. Bob Cortes, R-Altamonte Springs, faced a series of questions from Rep. David Richardson, D-Miami Beach, after introducing HB 7101, one of several measures under consideration in the legislative session that would increase access to charter schools. Like public schools, charter schools receive state funds. The key difference is they are privately managed. Richardson was curious about the bill’s provision that specifies that a charter school operator may use assets of their charter school for K-12 educational purposes in "other schools." "These other schools, would they also have to be a not-for-profit or could they be a for-profit?" Richardson asked. Cortes said, "They would have to be a school within their own network. So part of the charter school system itself." "So does that mean the other schools would have to be a 501(c)(3)?" Richardson asked. "All charter schools are not-for-profit," Cortes said. Cortes’ bill passed in the House by an 81-39 vote. The same argument resurfaced in debate of "schools of hope" legislation that would create a $200 million fund to lure charter schools to under-performing districts. Rep. Manny Diaz Jr., R-Hialeah, said, "Under Florida state statute, a charter school is a non-profit organization, so there is no such thing in Florida as a for-profit charter school." The statements jumped out to us because there have been problems with charter schools being used to benefit people privately. Florida law technically requires charter schools to be nonprofits. But the system is largely run by for-profit companies, which Cortes' statement leaves out. Not-for-profit, or not? The charter-school solution was originally touted as a way to give families — particular those in low-income areas — another option for schooling. Critics say too many taxpayer dollars have been shifted to the private companies that run charter schools to the detriment of traditional public schools. So, are all charter schools in Florida not-for-profit? Technically speaking, a not-for-profit is a type of organization that does not earn profits for its owners. Cortes cited a provision of a Florida statute (1002.33 sec 12(i)) as evidence of this claim, which mandates that a charter must organize as, or be operated by, a nonprofit organization. The Florida Department of Education echoed Cortes’ evidence. Audrey Walden, the agency’s press secretary, said the defining document that sets the academic, financial and organizational performance benchmarks for a charter school is determined by the local school district and the nonprofit charter school board. The charter governing board can choose to enter into contracts with private entities to provide services and support. "But, ultimately, performance and accountability rests with the nonprofit governing board -- which, when it enters into a charter agreement with its local school district, is subject to the same Sunshine Laws and School Accountability System that pertains to all public schools in Florida," she said. More to the story Not all charter schools operate in the same way. And sometimes nonprofit charter governing boards enter into contract with for-profit companies. The management company does not manage the governing board, but rather it handles certain aspects of the operations of the school under a contract with the governing board. The Miami Herald’s examination of South Florida’s charter school industry found several instances of for-profit management companies controlling charter schools’ day-to-day operations. The Herald found examples of charter schools relinquishing total control of their staff and finances to for-profit management companies. In Miami-Dade County, the Life Skills Center paid 97 percent of its income to cover fees incurred by a management company. Then, the governing board of two affiliated schools tried to "eject" the management company’s managers. As a result, the management company withheld money from the school and threatened to press charges against people within the school from trying to get it back. The Herald also found that some owners of the management companies also control the land and buildings used by the charter school. Owners of Academica Corp., the state’s largest charter school management company based in South Miami, collected almost $19 million a year in lease payments on school properties. In other cases, it found that the school’s nonprofit board were full of people with ties to the for-profit management companies. This trend continues across the nation. ProPublica reported that several charter schools around the country funneled all of their revenue to a for-profit company hired for day-to-day operations including schools in New York and Ohio. A spokesman for the state's largest teachers union, the Florida Education Association, sent us a report that summarized the agency’s arguments against "schools of hope" legislation. The FEA isn’t completely against charter schools, but its website says, "While some charters adhere to the original idea, and have shown some success, many charters have become for-profit drivers for large corporations bent on taking over our public schools." Our ruling Cortes said that all charter schools are not-for-profit. A Florida provision requires charter schools to be operated or controlled by a nonprofit organization. This technical talking point omits that many nonprofit charter school boards enter in to contracts with for-profit companies. Some for-profit charter school management companies have drawn increasing scrutiny over the years for how they’ve controlled the school’s money.

pomt-11382	"The United States is 3rd in murders throughout the world. If you remove Chicago, Detroit, Washington, St. Louis and New Orleans, the United States is then 189th out of 193 countries in the entire world."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/28/viral-image/united-states-third-murders-outlier-cities/	A viral meme shared on social media following the Parkland, Fla., shooting claimed the United States has the third-highest count of murders worldwide, a ranking that would drop dramatically if five major cities were excluded. The image has been circulating since at least 2015. We decided to take a closer look. Is the United States third in murders, and are a few outlier cities responsible? That’s false by any standard. The main study of intentional homicides is performed by the United Nations’ Office of Drug Control. The UN warns against cross-national comparisons because of the differences in legal definitions of intentional homicides and recording practices. Our count of the UN’s data placed the United States ninth in intentional homicides. We used the most up-to-date count for each country and territory, which included data anywhere from 2007 to 2015. As the country with the third-highest population size, however, experts told us the number of people killed is not a very useful metric. Controlling for population size, most criminologists use the per 100,000 metric. By that standard, we found the United States ranked 94th. When we counted only the countries for which the UN had 2015 data, the United States ranked 73rd. That’s still far from the top ten. Outlier cities The meme argues that a few outlier cities with stringent gun control legislation are responsible for the United States’ high homicide count. But that’s not true, either. Chicago, Detroit, Washington, St. Louis and New Orleans have homicide rates well above the national average, but that’s typical for large urban cities. While Detroit, St. Louis and New Orleans are consistently among the top five American cities by homicide rate, the cities with most per-capita murders vary from year to year. Neither Washington, D.C., nor Chicago make the top five. Chicago has a high number of homicides because of its population, but its homicide rate is middle of the road for large U.S. cities, according to Jay Corzine, a sociology professor at the University of Central Florida. Specific reasons for the cities’ high murder rates largely remain a mystery for criminologists, but all are cities with "high poverty levels, inequality, significant segregation, and an entrenched drug trade," Corzine said. Dropping them from the U.S. total has little substantive impact on the U.S. homicide rate or count. The cities cited in the meme accounted for 1,568 of 17,250, or 9.1 percent, of all homicides reported to the FBI in 2016, Tom Kovandzic, a criminologist at the University of Texas, Dallas, calculated for us. And without those cities, the homicide rate (per capita) would only decline by 7.73 percent, or from 5.34 to 4.93. When we applied those reductions to the UN data, the United States barely budged in its international standing. It moved down four spots in per capita murders and stayed the same in total murders. That’s inconsequential compared with the 186-spot jump the meme concocted. Gun control Gun control laws are mostly controlled by state legislatures. Washington, D.C., is the only listed city able to enact strict ordinances, while Chicago can do some things, according to Darrel Stephens, executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association. We’ve previously rated the claim that Chicago has the strictest gun laws Pants on Fire. "The other lie in this claim is that all five of the named cities have stringent gun regulation. Louisiana, Michigan and Missouri would be very surprised to hear that!" said Philip Cook, a sociologist at Duke University. The states didn’t impress the Giffords Law Center, a pro-gun control group. Missouri ranked 48th, Louisiana 43rd, and Michigan 16th on a scale that gives higher rankings to restricted gun ownership and use. Our ruling The image said, "The United States is 3rd in murders throughout the world. If you remove Chicago, Detroit, Washington, St. Louis and New Orleans, the United States is then 189th out of 193 countries in the entire world." By no measure is the United States third in total homicides or homicide rates. Excluding the named cities from the count had little to no impact on the United States’ international standing. Three of the cities named in the meme are consistently the top cities for intentional homicides in the United States, but the other two are not. They are by no means outliers, either.

pomt-13229	"What the District of Columbia was trying to do (with its handgun ban) was to protect toddlers from guns."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/19/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-supreme-court-gun-decision-de/	Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton claimed that her opposition to the 2008 Supreme Court case of District of Columbia vs. Heller was due to a desire to protect toddlers from firearms. Clinton said in the third presidential debate that she supported an individual’s right to bear arms but disagreed with how the court interpreted the Second Amendment because it didn’t accept "reasonable regulations" on gun ownership. "What the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns," Clinton said. There’s been a lot of discussion over how Clinton views the Second Amendment, but we were curious if she was accurately describing the rationale behind the case. The Heller case itself was a challenge to the Firearms Control Regulations Act of 1975, a broad ordinance passed by the Washington, D.C., city council that largely banned residents from owning handguns, automatic weapons and the possession of unregistered firearms, as well as requiring firearms kept in a home to be "unloaded, disassembled, or bound by a trigger lock or similar device." The handgun ban and subsequent gun control measures were widely considered to be one of the stricter rules on firearm ownership throughout the United States, though members of the D.C. council at the time said it seemed like the right thing to do. "Handgun crimes were just getting out of sight," said Sterling Tucker, a D.C. Council chairman when the ban was enacted. "We had to isolate and contain the problem. We thought a handgun law would do that." Passed in the mid 1970s, the ordinance continued with several legal challenges until 2007, when a federal court invalidated the law. That decision was upheld in a 5-4 Supreme Court ruling that the handgun ban and "trigger lock" provisions of the ordinance violated the Second Amendment. Before the Supreme Court ruling, city leaders fought hard to keep the ban, saying that its continued implementation reduced the number of stolen firearms and guns used in other crimes. In their appeal to the Supreme Court, the city government filed a petition with the court specifically citing the dangers posed to children if the gun ban was lifted. "The smaller the weapon, the more likely a child can use it, and children as young as three years old are strong enough to fire today’s handguns," the petition stated (page 25). The same petition also addressed the history of the ban, saying that in 1976 that the Council determined existing law didn’t sufficiently address gun violence and specifically cited the "chilling regularity with which handguns were taking the lives of children." But protecting children isn’t the only reason cited by the 30-page petition filed by the city’s government — the city also addressed general violent crime trends and other legal arguments in asking the Supreme Court to hear the case. And the court’s decision in Heller went far beyond just overturning the city’s gun ban, as it broadly affirmed for the first time an individual right to private gun ownership. Clinton’s campaign referred us to a gun control group claiming that gun locks and child access prevention laws help prevent unintentional firearm deaths for young children. PolitiFact has previously looked into whether the city’s gun ban had any effect on violent crime, finding that violent crime levels varied year-to-year and that other social and demographic factors played a larger role than gun laws. Our ruling Clinton said her opposition to the 2008 Heller case was because "what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns." City leaders did specifically cite the danger posed to children in trying to keep in place gun regulations, but the regulations were also a widespread ban on unregistered weapons, not just gun safety measures. Child safety wasn’t the sole topic cited by defenders of the city’s gun control ordinance, and the Heller decision dealt with a much broader issue than protecting toddlers from firearm deaths or injuries.

pomt-10333	"We now have a pro-American president in France, which shows if you live long enough, anything can happen in this world."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/23/john-mccain/you-didnt-actually-have-to-live-that-long/	Yes, it's a joke. But it's a favorite of Sen. John McCain's on the stump, and it includes a couple of serious claims worth checking. A recent iteration of the gag came during a McCain speech at the Maine Military Museum & Learning Center in South Portland, Maine, after a reference to how the French approach nuclear power. "And by the way, in case you missed it, we now have a pro-American president in France," McCain said July 21, 2008. "Which shows if you live long enough, anything can happen in this world. So — and we're grateful to him." It's a self-deprecating poke by McCain at his own age. But it's also a jab at France, and it rests on the twin assumptions that the country's new president, Nicolas Sarkozy, is pro-American, and that it is new or unusual for the president of France to feel that way. We know where McCain's coming from. There has long been in France, especially in the intellectual class, a resistance to American culture. They like their boulangeries, or bakeries, a lot more than the McDonald's we're exporting to them, for example. Sarkozy is different, in some respects. "He likes American culture more than any other former president of France," said Jean-Philippe Mathy, French studies professor at the University of Illinois and author of French Resistance: The French-American Culture Wars. "He's taking a lot of flak because he's kind of nouveau riche and he likes to wear expensive watches and things like that." He's got a little Hollywood in him. Just check out his wife . Sarkozy's open admiration for America has earned him the nickname "Sarko l'Amricain." That said, he's not quite as pro-American as McCain implies, nor are past French presidents as anti-American. Sarkozy is an ardent proponent of U.S.-style free-market capitalism — a philosophy that in Europe is called "liberalism" but resembles what we call conservatism. He is intent on dismantling portions of France's prodigious welfare state and social security system. But with respect to the most notable policy difference between France and the United States in recent years — the split over the decision to invade Iraq — Sarkozy is only somewhat different from his predecessor, Jacques Chirac. Chirac opposed the invasion before it took place, and in November 2004 said it had "made the world more dangerous." Sarkozy has accused Chirac of being "arrogant" for the manner in which he voiced his opposition, but Sarkozy did not support the war either, and has let it be known that he too would have declined to send troops to Iraq. In a speech at Columbia University in 2004, Sarkozy said France's opposition stemmed from its violent colonial history in Algeria and Vietnam. "Please don't be angry with us because we remember what happened to us," he said. "Is there ever a single country of the world, at any time of history, that was able to maintain itself in a sustained way in a country that was not its own, uniquely by force of arms? Never, not a single one, even the Chinese." That follows in a long tradition of French presidents who, while maintaining a close alliance with the United States, have resisted certain aspects of our foreign policy to varying degrees. Franois Mitterrand, a socialist who was president of France from 1981 to 1995, leaned toward the hostile end of that spectrum. On the other hand, his predecessor, Valry Giscard d'Estaing, a probusiness, center-right politician who was president from 1974 to 1981, was widely regarded as very friendly to the United States, experts said. Charles de Gaulle, president from 1959 to 1969, was famously resistant to American influence, and is probably the main source of the stereotype to which McCain was referring, according to Edward Berenson, director of the Institute of French Studies at New York University. He pulled France's troops out of NATO's command structure to signal independence from Washington in 1966, though ultimately he leaned sharply away from the Soviet Union and toward the United States in the Cold War. So yes, a strain of anti-Americanism runs through French foreign policy and culture, flaring up at times and mellowing out at others. But French presidents have long been pro-American in the most important sense, maintaining their alliance with the United States. And if it's France's objection to the invasion of Iraq that McCain's audience is concerned about, he's misleading them to suggest Sarkozy is very different. But Sarko is Amricain in some respects, so we find McCain's claim to be Half True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-07-23T00:00:00	2008-07-21	['France']
pomt-02442	"Federal government reneging" on Medicaid payments to Wisconsin caused about $240 million in extra costs in the 2013-’15 state budget.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/feb/28/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-federal-government-reneged-medic/	One of Gov. Scott Walker’s explanations for rejecting a full expansion of Medicaid under the federal "Obamacare" health care law was this: The feds won’t be good for the money. And for more than a year, the Republican governor has cited a piece of recent state budget history as evidence. Most recently, Walker made his case to a national cable audience in a Fox News Sunday appearance on Feb. 23, 2014, telling interviewer Chris Wallace he doubted the federal law’s promise to cover 100 percent of the expansion for three years and no less than 90 percent thereafter starting in 2020. State taxpayers pick up the rest. "That commitment is not going to be there and taxpayers all across America will be on the hook," Walker said. "They are not going to be on the hook in Wisconsin." That’s a prediction, but it was followed by this piece of evidence stated as fact: "Even before the Medicaid expansion I had (provided) $600 million more to Medicaid. Almost 40 percent of that was to fill in the federal government reneging on commitments they've already made even before the Medicaid expansion." In other words, they’ll break their promise because they’ve done it before. With Walker’s decisions on Obamacare and Medicaid poised to become 2014 campaign issues let’s look at this one. Did "federal reneging" on Medicaid payments to Wisconsin pile approximately $240 million in extra costs onto the 2013-’15 state budget? How it works The biggest component of the broken promise, in Walker’s view, is a recent drop in the federal government’s share of what Wisconsin spends on Medicaid, which has covered children and parents with children under 19 in low-income households as well as people who are disabled or over 65 and impoverished." The federal share was 60.21 percent in 2010, but by 2014 fell to 59.06 and is projected to drop further, to 58.27 percent, for the 2015 fiscal year. That has raised costs to Wisconsin taxpayers, but there’s a major problem in Walker’s contention. The federal share -- known as the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, or FMAP -- fluctuates annually and varies from state to state based on a formula dating to Medicaid’s inception in 1965. That formula is "designed so that the federal government pays a larger portion of Medicaid costs in states with lower per-capita incomes relative to the national average (and vice versa for states with higher per-capita incomes)," a Congressional Research Service paper noted in 2013. In other words, the standard federal share of Medicaid costs is not promised or guaranteed to hold steady; it must only stay between the statutory minimum of 50 percent and maximum of 83 percent. It has gone up notably in some recent years as well. In fact, Wisconsin saw its federal rate rise from 2009 to 2010, and also got a big additional bump to more than 70 percent for almost three years under the federal stimulus law and a subsequent legislative action -- both of which applied nationally. Another major cost increase Walker has cited to back up his claim in the last year relates to hikes in the cost of premiums, deductibles and copayments that Medicaid pays for so-called "dual eligibles" who qualify for Medicare and Medicaid. No reversal Walker spokesman Tom Evenson said these and other cost increases are evidence of reneging by Washington. But neither the fluctuations in federal help or the dual-eligible cost changes are due to any changes in federal Medicaid law or policy, according to the independent, nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau. It made this note in a November 2013 memo to state Rep. Jon Richards (D-Milwaukee). The federal cost-sharing formula has not been changed to reduce matching rates since President Reagan and Congress enacted a temporary reduction for 1982-1984, said Edwin Park, a health-policy expert at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. And the cost increases for "dual eligibles" are routine, reflecting rising health care costs, Park said. Finally, Walker cites new costs states will have to pick up under Obamacare. They are real, but two experts told us they do not represent a broken commitment. Conservative health economist Stephen Parente at the University of Minnesota shares Walker’s skepticism about future federal funding of the Medicaid expansion, especially given Obama’s pull-backs in putting the health-care law into full effect. And he said governors are rightly frustrated by swings in Medicaid payments from Washington. But Parente said it’s not accurate to call those swings "reneging." Jon Peacock, research director at the left-leaning Wisconsin Council on Children & Families, agreed. His view is Walker could have made the state less vulnerable to declines in federal help if he had taken the additional federal money available for the Medicaid expansion. "If we took advantage of the Medicaid expansion funds," Peacock told us, "we would get a much higher matching rate that is locked in (under the law.)" Our rating Explaining his rejection of federal money to fully expand Medicaid coverage, Walker said on Fox News Sunday that "federal government reneging" on Medicaid payments to Wisconsin caused more than $200 million in extra costs in the 2013-’15 state budget. But typical cost-sharing fluctuations, based mainly on a longstanding formula, explain the extra state burden -- not any reversal of course or pulling back on a commitment by Washington.

pomt-13502	"The Clinton Foundation gives less than 10 (percent in direct aid). In 2013, they raised 140 million bucks, gave $9 million to people in direct aid."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2016/sep/06/alex-castellanos/trump-surrogate-repeats-wrong-talking-point-clinto/	Surrogates for Donald Trump continue to make the argument that the Clinton Foundation is a "slush fund" for Bill and Hillary Clinton, and they keep repeating an inaccurate talking point. While discussing on Meet the Press why Trump has yet to release his tax returns, Republican strategist Alex Castellanos turned the tables, saying that the nonprofit bearing Clinton’s name doesn’t do much except enrich her family. "Because that idea that somehow the Clinton Foundation is this wonderful thing that helps people, most charities give 75 percent of their money in direct aid. The Clinton Foundation gives less than 10 (percent). In 2013, they raised 140 million bucks, gave 9 million to people in direct aid," Castellanos said. We’ve heard various versions of this claim (from former GOP presidential candidate Carly Fiorina, conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh and RNC chairman Reince Priebus). It’s misleading. Castellanos’ numbers don’t take into account the bulk of the foundation's work. The foundation does spend a lot of money on charity, not through grantmaking, but through its own programming. Tax returns show the Clinton Foundation raised just under $143 million and spent about $85 million, including $9 million in grants to other organizations. But that does not include all of the foundation's charitable work "Grantmaking is not part of its mission, and that creates confusion — since many people imagine that foundations are engaged in giving away money," writes David Callahan, editor of Inside Philanthropy. Despite its name, the Clinton Foundation is not actually a private foundation (like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation or the Donald J. Trump Foundation) that solely gives to philanthropic causes. Rather, it’s a public charity, like United Way or the Salvation Army, that runs its own in-house projects and hires staff to carry out the work. Clinton Foundation programs include providing women in Peru with the tools and equipment to launch their own businesses, installing solar panels and grids in Haiti after the earthquake, helping farmers in Tanzania boost yields and turn a profit, and using market mechanisms to reduce the cost of HIV/AIDS medicine. All together, these programs cost $68 million in 2013 (page 10 of the foundation’s tax documents for that year), or about 80 percent of all of the foundation's expenses that year. In 2014, programs were 87 percent of the Clinton Foundation’s expenses, according to Charity Navigator, giving it a score of 10 out of 10 on that metric. Here’s a more detailed breakdown of the foundation’s 2013 expenses: In sum, Castellanos’ claim is "totally wrong," Callahan of Inside Philanthropy told PolitiFact. "The vast majority of the money raised goes to support program work in the field, as anyone can tell from looking at the Clinton Foundation’s annual finances." Castellanos did not respond to requests for comment. Our ruling Castellanos said, "The Clinton Foundation gives less than 10 (percent in direct aid). In 2013, they raised 140 million bucks, gave $9 million to people in direct aid." Castellanos is cherry-picking one line-item that doesn't include all of the foundation's spending on charity. While outside grantmaking made up about 10 percent of its expenses in 2013, the foundation spent about $68 million, or about 80 percent, on in-house charitable programs to help those in need.

pomt-06362	Says "the City of Portland alone has 84 public relation representatives on payroll which cost taxpayers over $6.2 million (a year)."	false	/oregon/statements/2011/nov/04/taxpayer-association-oregon/does-portland-really-have-84-pr-people-staff/	Nobody likes hearing about government waste -- especially not when lawmakers spend most of their time talking about which programs to cut. So, naturally, we read with interest the Taxpayer Association of Oregon's Fall 2011 "Government Waste Watch Report." We weren’t a paragraph in and already something had caught our attention. The report noted that "The City of Portland alone has 84 public relation representatives on payroll, which cost taxpayers over $6.2 million." The Oregonian had just published a story pegging the number of state employees working in communications at 125, or 220 if you include managers and people in design shops. Sure, Portland is the state’s largest city by far, but 84 for the city alone? The report cited the source for the number as a Willamette Week story from May. We did some googling and found the original article. Just a few paragraphs in and you get the salient info: "There are a lot of them (public relations employees) — 94 in the Portland area — and their paychecks add up to nearly $7 million a year … these public-relations people work for the City of Portland, Metro, Portland Public Schools, Multnomah County, the Port of Portland, Portland State University, TriMet and Oregon Health & Science University." Just a couple sentences further and the writer, James Pitkin, addresses Portland specifically: "The biggest PR team belongs to the City of Portland. It spends $2.1 million paying its 28 PR people." That’s sizable, but it’s hardly the 84 that the Taxpayer Association cited in its critique. Willamette Week also posted a list of the folks that they identified as being on the payroll in communications positions. We called Portland’s Bureau of Human Resources to see if we could confirm the names. The Bureau sent us a copy of a public records request dated July 14, 2011 that listed 25 employees. We reconciled the two lists and found that Willamette Week included the Portland Development Commission, bumping their figure of 28 employees. With the PDC, their salaries were closer to $2.1 million, not $6 million. We called the Taxpayer Association to see what was up. Jason Williams, the executive director, said the mistake was theirs. While typing up the newsletter, they confused the city’s figures with the Portland-area figures. Still, he said, even 28 public relations employees was too many. "Eighty-four is even too much even for the whole state. If government is doing its job, it doesn't need a press agent." The fact that Williams admitted their mistake gets the association some brownie points, but it doesn’t change the fact that they were misinforming the 10,000 people who receive their watch reports. And it doesn’t change our ruling. We give this claim a False. Return to OregonLive to comment on this statement and ruling.

pomt-03283	A Republican housing finance reform bill "would eliminate a person’s ability to obtain 15- and 30-year mortgages."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/aug/04/gwen-moore/gop-bill-would-put-traditional-home-mortgages-out-/	After the real estate market collapsed during the Great Depression, the federal government created entities to encourage families to buy houses and banks to make home loans. The Federal Housing Administration, founded in 1934, issues mortgage insurance to guarantee banks they will get their money back even if a homeowner doesn’t make payments. That made it easier for banks to approve mortgages for people who don’t have a lot of money or have mediocre credit. Fannie Mae and later Freddie Mac, two government-sponsored enterprises, were created to buy up, bundle and sell mortgages as mortgage-backed securities on the open market. That gave lenders more money to make home loans. But by 2008, Uncle Sam had to bail out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as the recession took hold. And several years later, FHA was also in financial straits. Those developments helped precipitate a move in July 2013 by Republican leaders of the House Financial Services Committee. They announced they would introduce the Protecting American Taxpayers and Homeowners Act (PATH), aiming at largely removing the government from the financing of home purchases. That prompted U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, a member of the committee, to go on the attack. "This radical bill would push the dream of home ownership further and further out of reach for Wisconsin families. The so-called PATH Act is, in actuality, the PATH to Nowhere," the Wisconsin Democrat charged in a July 24, 2013 news release. The bill, Moore continued, "would eliminate a person’s ability to obtain 15- and 30-year mortgages – the cornerstone of our housing finance system." Let’s see if that’s so. Moore's evidence Moore spokeswoman Staci Cox told us that when Moore referred to "a person’s" ability to obtain a traditional fixed-rate mortgage, she meant the "average American." To back the statement, Cox highlighted testimony made to the House Financial Services Committee by Mark Zandi, chief economist for the Moody's Analytics economic research firm. He said the PATH bill would put 30-year fixed-rate mortgage loans "out of reach for most Americans." Without the government guarantees, mortgage rates would increase, adding $130 per month to the cost of a mortgage for the typical borrower, Zandi said. And while three-quarters of mortgage loans currently are fixed rate, that would drop to 20 percent to 25 percent, he said. Moore also cites opposition to aspects of the bill from several major players in housing. The National Association of Home Builders, for example, said the bill would "greatly limit homeownership" for "many qualified Americans"; and the Credit Union National Association said it feared the bill could not "ensure continuation of long-term fixed-rate mortgage products." So, Moore doesn’t have hard evidence that the PATH bill would eliminate the ability of a person to get a traditional mortgage; that remains to be seen. But experts say such mortgages could become unavailable or unaffordable for many people. GOP response The PATH bill, pushed by U.S. Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, would shut down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in five years and limit the focus of the FHA's mortgage insurance to first-time home buyers with moderate incomes. Jeff Emerson, a staff member of the House Financial Services Committee, gave us a response to Moore's claim. Emerson cited a Washington Post editorial that rebutted the assertion that 30-year mortgages would go away. The editorial noted that 30-year fixed-rate loans known as jumbo mortgages "already exist without government help," saying: "Presumably private-sector innovation could create loan products, with 30-year terms or otherwise, appropriate for smaller borrowers as well." But current jumbo mortgages require a borrower to have a higher income, a good credit score and typically a 30 percent down payment, according to Realtor.com. Emerson also said PATH "is designed to create more opportunities for more choices, including the 30-year fixed rate loan. The market will respond to customer demand, as it always does." So, while there is no indication that traditional mortgages would cease to exist, neither of Emerson's points are evidence that they would remain as available as they are with today's government guarantees. Other evidence Other experts, while disagreeing on the overall impact of PATH on traditional fixed-rate mortgages, acknowledge that the elimination of government guarantees or subsidies inevitably means that the terms of such mortgages would change. Georgetown University law professor Adam Levitin, whose specialties include housing finance, agreed with Zandi. He testified to House Financial Services Committee that the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is "heavily a function of federal backing of the housing finance system" and that if PATH became law, "it would be difficult for most American families to obtain 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages." Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the conservative American Action Forum, and Mark Calabria, director of financial regulation studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, testified that affordable fixed-rate mortgages would still be offered, but they weren’t specific. Calabria noted the current availability of fixed-rate jumbo home mortgages, as well as fixed-rate auto loans. In a New York Times opinion column, University of Maryland public policy professor Phillip Swagel, who is also a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, praised the PATH bill. But he acknowledged that without government guarantees, mortgage interest rates would rise, though "it is hard to know quite how much." He also stated the housing market "is in an upswing and affordability remains high, so it seems likely that the housing sector would continue to recover even with higher rates." Our rating Moore stated that a Republican bill to largely privatize the nation’s housing finance system "would eliminate a person’s ability to obtain 15- and 30-year mortgages." It's unknown how exactly the effects of the bill would play out. But there is reason to believe that without government guarantees, traditional home mortgages would become less available, less affordable, or both, for many Americans. Our definition of Half True is a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details. That fits for this one.

pomt-13258	Hillary Clinton said gun confiscation "would be worth considering."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2016/oct/17/national-rifle-association/nra-weakly-claims-clinton-said-gun-confiscation-wo/	A National Rifle Association flier shows the jaws of a crane dumping hundreds of rifles into a landfill. "What did Hillary Clinton say when she was asked about gun confiscation in America?" it asks in capital letters. The flier answers the question with this Clinton quote: "I think it would be worth considering doing it on a national level, if that can be arranged." Next to the quote is a photo of a strident-looking Clinton speaking into a microphone. We examined whether Clinton really did say that U.S. gun confiscation is "worth considering." The flier was issued by the NRA’s lobbying arm, the Institute for Legislative Action. It says Clinton made the statement during a town hall campaign event in Keene, N.H., on Oct 16, 2015. She was asked whether she’d support a national gun buyback program similar to one Australia instituted in 1996 after a mass shooting in Tasmania left 35 dead. A month later, Australia banned semi-automatic and self-loading rifles as well as shotguns. The government offered a one-year grace period during which it would buy back the firearms at fair-market prices. After that, people possessing the weapons would subject to strict penalties. The buyback program resulted in more than 640,000 prohibited weapons being turned in - roughly one-fifth of all the guns then estimated to be in Australia. Now, let’s go back to the New Hampshire town hall meeting. A tape shows a man asked Clinton this question: "Australia managed to take away tens of thousands - millions - of handguns and in one year they were all gone. Can we do that and why? If we can’t, why not? (The questioner was wrong in saying the buyback pertained to handguns; it didn’t.) Clinton replied that several nations have tightened their gun laws after experiencing mass shootings. "In the Australian example, as I recall, that was a buyback program," she said. "The Australian government, as part of trying to clamp down on the availability of automatic weapons, offered a good price for buying hundreds of thousands of guns and then they basically clamped down going forward in terms of, you know, more of a background check, more of a permitting approach. "But they believed, and I think the evidence supports them, that by offering to buy back those guns they were able to, you know, curtail the supply and set a different standard for gun purchases in the future." "Now (U.S.) communities have done that; communities have done gun buyback programs. But I think it would be worth considering doing that on the national level if that could be arranged." Clinton mentioned "cash for clunkers," the nickname of a 2009 voluntary program in which the U.S. government briefly offered payments to people wishing to trade in old, gas-guzzling vehicles. "So I think that’s worth considering," Clinton said. "I don’t know enough details to tell you how we would do it or how it would work. But certainly, the Australian example is worth considering." The NRA and other pro-gun groups instantly seized on Clinton’s comment, saying the buyback program Clinton lauded is tantamount to a confiscation program, because it backed many gun owners into a corner: They either could sell their firearms to the government or risk prosecution for keeping them. It was, the NRA says, "an offer gun owners could not refuse." Three days after the New Hampshire event, the Clinton campaign said the candidate opposes gun confiscation and accused the NRA of distorting her comments. "Of course Hillary does not support national mandatory gun buyback programs, including those modeled after Australia's program," spokesman Josh Schwerin wrote to us in an email. "She was discussing voluntary buyback programs, which are drastically different than what occurred in Australia and are regularly run by cities across the America." We asked the NRA if it had any other evidence that it believes shows Clinton is open to gun confiscation. A spokeswoman for the gun group’s lobbying arm questioned whether that was "relevant" to our fact-check and didn’t provide an answer. Our ruling The NRA says that when Clinton was asked about gun confiscation, she said "I think it would be worth doing it on a national level, if that can be arranged." Clinton made that statement last year at a New Hampshire campaign stop, when she was asked a vague question about an Australian program that gave gun owners one year to sell certain firearms to the government before those weapons became illegal. She left the NRA some room. But the NRA stretches her words to an almost unrecognizable form. Clinton focused her comments on voluntary buyback programs similar to those some U.S. communities have instituted for guns and the federal "cash-for-clunkers" program. She was ambiguous about how a U.S. guns buyback program might be structured, saying "I don’t know enough details to tell you how we would do it or how it would work." And her campaign since has said she opposes gun confiscation. So there’s an element of truth to the NRA’s statement, but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That makes it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9e238568-ad07-4375-9b74-3a07ed468f3c	None	National Rifle Association	None	None	None	2016-10-17T00:02:00	2016-10-08	['None']
pomt-08987	Phoenix is the kidnapping capital "of the Western Hemisphere."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2010/jul/15/helen-glover/helen-glover-says-phoenix-kidnap-capital-western-h/	After Republican congressional candidate John Loughlin returned from a trip to Arizona to get a firsthand look at the illegal immigration problem there, he was a guest on WHJJ's Helen Glover show. Loughlin told the story of a couple who live in Casa Grande, near Phoenix, who told him that they had stopped going biking because they were afraid of being kidnapped. "Phoenix is now the kidnapping capital of America," Loughlin declared. Glover agreed, but then insisted that the distinction extended beyond the United States. "Exactly. Of the Western Hemisphere. Yes. It includes the Western Hemisphere," she said. If you listen to the program you can hear Loughlin hesitate, showing some uncertainty over Glover's emphatic statement. With good reason. PolitiFact Texas addressed this issue in detail on June 18 when it examined a claim that Phoenix "is now the No. 2 kidnapping capital of the world, right behind Mexico City." It looked at it again when John McCain repeated that claim. It appears to originate from a Feb. 11, 2009, report from ABC News, which has not responded to a request from PolitiFact to document its assertion. PolitiFact Texas made its own inquiries to determine how Phoenix ranks on a worldwide scale. They were unable to find any hard numbers to back up the claim. It's clear that Phoenix has a serious kidnapping problem, which the police say is mostly related to illegal border crossings and the drug trade. There were 358 cases reported to the police in 2008, 318 in 2009 and 105 between January and May of this year. To put those numbers in some context, Philadelphia, which is comparable in population, reported just 9 kidnappings in 2009 -- 309 fewer than Phoenix. There is no easy source for comparable figures from other U.S. cities; kidnapping numbers are not routinely listed on annual FBI crime reports. There is also no reliable source of kidnapping data from foreign countries. But experts from international private security firms said cities in several Western Hemisphere countries, including Mexico, Colombia and Guatemala, have more kidnappings than Phoenix. Glover took an apparently made up statistic and took it a step further from the facts, making Phoenix the hemisphere's worst for kidnapping. We emailed Glover late Friday, July 9, and asked for her source. She responded by email the next day, saying she would look for the source and invited us to do a Google search as well. Monday morning, July 12, at 6:22 a.m. she sent another email. "You are right, I was wrong," she responded, and said she was "remembering wrongly what I had read. According to an ABCNews report from '09, Phoenix is #1 in the U.S. for kidnappings, with Mexico City being #1 in the Western Hem. Shame on me for remembering wrongly." (The ABC News article makes no mention of the Western Hemisphere.) So did Glover take a few seconds to set the record straight for her listeners later that morning? We listened to all three hours of her Monday show, available as a podcast on the WHJJ website. She touched on immigration, but never corrected the record. So we'll do it for her and give her a False.

pomt-09598	Health care reform: "Everything about it is going to raise costs, raise taxes and lower the quality of health care."	false	/texas/statements/2010/jan/20/kay-bailey-hutchison/hutchison-says-health-care-bill-will-raise-costs-t/	A day after Senate Democrats released their version of the health care reform bill on Nov. 18, U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, who's seeking the GOP nod for governor, debuted a TV ad attacking the legislation. "Everything about it is going to raise costs, raise taxes and lower the quality of health care," Hutchison says in the ad. Everything? This kind of sweeping claim is often hard to back up with evidence. Hutchinson said everything in the bills would raise costs, raise taxes and lower quality. So if we can find anything that lowers costs, lowers taxes or raises quality, that would undermine the accuracy of her claim. Hutchison's campaign told us the senator was criticizing all Democratic proposals. Her campaign sent us about 20 excerpts from documents seemingly supporting her claim, attributing most of it to to the Republican Policy Committee and the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, both in Washington. We don't dispute any of the projected costs and taxes her campaign sent us. But like many parties to the health care debate, Hutchison appears to have cherry-picked numbers to prop up the points she wants to make. Let's talk about tax increases first. Hutchison notes that the bill includes a "$149 billion tax increase on private health insurance plans." She fails to mention that the levy, known as the "Cadillac tax," is one measure the federal government expects to generate revenue by taxing high-priced insurance plans (not all private policies). That is, most people, about 75 percent, won't see an additional tax. Hutchison cites "$43 billion in new taxes and fines levied on individuals and businesses," an abbreviated interpretation of how much the CBO has projected the federal government will generate in penalty payments from people and businesses who choose not to enroll in an insurance plan. She doesn't note that those increases are among the measure's features intended to offset costs. And she also fails to note that a good chunk of taxpayers — those who make up to 400 percent of the poverty level — will get a tax credit from the government to buy health insurance. So those people won't get a tax increase and in fact get a material benefit from the plan. Next, we looked at projected costs. Hutchison's campaign pointed us to total projected federal health care expenditures: $234 billion, according to a report by Richard Foster, chief actuary for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the federal agency that administers Medicare, Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program. Unnoted by Hutchison's camp: The $234 billion reflects how much national health care expenditures would increase by 2016 — including the cost of providing coverage for 33 million people who were previously uninsured — about 10 percent of the population, most of whom (we'll suppose) would see the new benefit as a boon. Also unnoted by Hutchison: The CBO projects that under the Senate's health care plan, most insured people would see their premiums drop slightly by 2016. The CBO also concluded that through 2019, the Senate approach would reduce the federal deficit by $130 billion and slow the rate of federal spending growth due to new taxes and provisions to reduce spending over time. Spending cuts have also been proposed to save money — Hutchison notes $120 billion from Medicare Advantage, among others. We learned that's what she's referring to when she says quality will suffer. Yet the Senate plan separately has features intended to enhance quality such as pilot programs rewarding doctors for improving patients' outcomes and aimed at curbing unnecessary medical tests. We looked too at the impact of the plan on American taxpayers. The bottom line, according to the CMS and CBO projections, is that most people's taxes would not increase and most people's premiums wouldn't either. Summing up, Hutchison is correct that the Senate plan is projected to increase costs — at the onset — and to add taxes. But she she overlooked CBO projections stating the plan would slow long-term federal spending thanks to its provisions designed to offset costs. Hutchison stretches too far by saying everything in the bill would raise taxes, drive up costs and conceivably diminish quality. As we've described, several parts of the bill are intended to lower costs, and most people won't see a tax increase. We rate her overreach False.

pomt-05460	In the past three years, "we've added enough new oil and gas pipeline to circle the Earth and then some."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/apr/23/barack-obama/obama-says-new-miles-pipeline-could-stretch-around/	President Barack Obama kept up the drumbeat for his "all of the above" energy strategy with a speech in the White House Rose Garden. Addressing criticism that he has stood in the way of domestic production, in the April 17, 2012, speech Obama said the opposite is true. "There are politicians who say that if we just drilled more, then gas prices would come down right away. What they don’t say is that we have been drilling more. Under my administration, America is producing more oil than at any time in the last eight years. We’ve opened up new areas for exploration. We've quadrupled the number of operating rigs to a record high. We've added enough new oil and gas pipeline to circle the Earth and then some," Obama said, with a nod to middle-school science class. We've been hearing a lot about oil production recently and have checked several statements from Obama and Republicans on the matter. Here, we decided to check something we haven't heard before -- that the United States has added enough oil and gas pipeline to circle the Earth since Obama took office. First, it's important to note that it's unusual for presidents to become involved in decisions about pipeline construction, which is largely driven by whether the oil and gas industry is willing to make the large investment, an expert told us. Obama rejected an expedited plan pushed by Republicans to build the Keystone XL pipeline, but he has also emphasized the importance of pipeline construction. He has said that domestic production exceeds current pipeline capacity and in March signed an executive order streamlining the permitting and construction process of a new crude oil pipeline to Gulf Coast refineries. For this item, we’re not addressing whether Obama deserves credit for the pipeline because of the limited role presidents have. But we can check whether that much pipeline has been added. To back up Obama's claim, the White House pointed us to statistics from the U.S. Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, which regulates pipelines. The DOT figures were last updated in April 2012 with mileage figures through 2010. So they do not include pipeline that was added last year or this year. Here's a comparison of the mileage at the end of 2008 (right before Obama took office) and the end of 2010: Crude oil 2008: 50,963 miles 2010: 54,728 +3,765 Petroleum products 2008: 61,599 2010: 64,752 + 3,153 Natural gas transmission 2008: 303,182 2010: 304,691 + 1,509 Natural gas distribution 2008: 2,074,513 2010: 2,095,690 + 21,177 That adds up to 2,490,257 oil and gas pipeline miles in 2008, and 2,519,861 in 2010. So that's 29,604 additional miles of pipeline. According to NASA, the equatorial circumference of the Earth is 24,873.6 miles. Obama's comparison is accurate, and given that the latest figures only cover through 2010, the real, current figure is likely higher. We asked two experts if the year-to-year comparison of pipeline miles is a valid measure and if anything else should be considered. Jay Hakes, former director of the Energy Information Administration under President Bill Clinton, said the data are reliable and "as near as I can tell, the assertion is well documented and correct." Tadeusz Patzek, chair of the Department of Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin, pointed out that many miles of those pipelines are "field/project gathering lines of small diameter and small throughput" -- not large transmission lines many of us think of. He's right. According to the DOT numbers, 21,177 miles of the new pipeline are listed as natural gas distribution lines. Still, such lines are "a necessary piece" of the whole system. Said Patzek: "Without the small stuff you’re not going to increase the flow rate through the large." Is 29,604 miles over three years a lot? For some perspective, we looked at the miles added during the last three years of George W. Bush's presidency. They tell a wholly different story: 63,243 new miles of small natural gas distrbution lines -- more than Obama's overall total. But crude oil? Just 756 miles. Petroleum products: 808 fewer miles in 2005 than in 2007. We're not suggesting Obama has done better than Bush in this regard. The comparison simply reinforces the point that oil and gas supply and demand, and the industry's response to it, results from decisions made far from the White House. Our ruling Obama said the U.S. has added enough pipeline in the last three years to circle the Earth "and then some." He is right about the mileage, though it includes not just large interstate transmission lines but also small pipes that collect gas from groups of wells and feed to the larger lines. But those pipelines are a link in the grid, and Obama didn't specify only large transmission pipeline. The statement is accurate. We rate it True.

pomt-10741	Edwards says if Congress won't pass universal health care, he'll tell Congress: "I'm going to use my power as president to take your health care away from you."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/07/john-edwards/prez-cant-snatch-congress-health-care/	A television ad shows John Edwards giving a campaign speech and vowing to fight for universal health care coverage. "When I'm president I'm going to say to members of Congress and members of my administration, including my cabinet: I'm glad that you have health care coverage and your family has health care coverage," Edwards says. "But if you don't pass universal health care by July of 2009 – in six months – I'm going to use my power as president to take your health care away from you." Cue the wild applause. The problem with this statement is that the president can't just "take away" health care from Congress. "Health care for Congress and the administration is passed by statute. The president can't repeal a law on his own," said Don Ritchie, associate historian of the Senate Historical Office. "Congress has the power of the purse and passes legislation. It's the president who's dependent on Congress to get legislation passed," he said. If we broaden our view from the 30-second ad, Edwards fleshed out his idea in a September 2007 speech he gave in Chicago. During that speech, he explained that his plan was to "submit legislation that ends health care coverage for the president, all members of Congress, and all senior political appointees in both branches of government on July 20th, 2009 -- unless we have passed universal health care reform." That's a more realistic scenario, and there's nothing to stop a president from submitting legislation if he can find a member to introduce it. But count us dubious on Congress voting away its own health care coverage. In the meantime, we find Edwards' lordly pronouncement in his TV ad to border on the absurd. As a former member of the U.S. senate, he should know better. For that reason, we give him the rare Pants on Fire ruling.

pomt-10635	"You've got a building in the Cayman Islands that supposedly houses 12,000 corporations. That's either the biggest building or the biggest tax scam on record."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/09/barack-obama/yes-but-its-not-illegal/	Thousands of subsidiaries, many from U.S. corporations, have indeed set up shop — or more precisely, hung a nameplate — at the five-story Ugland House and other financial centers in the Cayman Islands. They include Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, General Motors, Intel, FedEx and Sprint. But while Sen. Barack Obama is right on the general point, calling the practice "the biggest tax scam on record" is questionable. From the quote itself, it's hard to tell if Obama is taking issue with the way companies use the Caymans as a tax shelter, or if he's objecting to the U.S. tax code that makes it possible. "There's nothing better than to beat up on a tax haven on a beach," said Douglas Shackelford, a professor at the University of North Carolina's business school. "It sounds crooked, but if one really thinks about the facts, I don't see the grounding." Weather isn't drawing the corporations, of course. The Caymans do not have a corporate income tax. The United States taxes corporate income at 35 percent, higher than most countries. As long as profits are not brought back to the United States, or "repatriated," no tax is due. Federal law allows the taxation of "passive income," meaning the interest earned on profits of those subsidiaries. But typically the companies reinvest the money elsewhere, Shackelford said. Obama is the co-sponsor of legislation that would crack down on offshore activities by corporations and individuals. The Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act would target an estimated $100-billion annually, including $30-billion from corporations. According to published financial reports, Coca-Cola alone saved $500-million in U.S. taxes in 2003 through foreign subsidiaries. Its Cayman company controls syrup-producing facilities in Ireland. The subsidiary pays taxes in Ireland at 12.5 percent, still far less than in the United States. So, Obama is right that thousands of corporations, and some do say more than 12,000, are in one building in the Caymans, but he goes too far when he implies it's an illegal scam.

pomt-14211	The Colorado caucus system for selecting Republican delegates is "rigged."	false	/colorado/statements/2016/apr/19/donald-trump/trump-calls-colorado-caucus-system-rigged-theres-n/	After Ted Cruz completed his sweep of all 34 delegates at the Colorado Republican convention, Donald Trump branded the state GOP’s caucus system "rigged" and "crooked." Trump told Fox & Friends that rank-and-file Colorado Republicans are "going absolutely crazy because they weren't given a vote, this was given by politicians. It's a crooked deal. ... It's a rigged system." Trump implied that he didn’t bother speaking to the Colorado convention because state "politicians" controlled the process and there’s "no voting." Fox News contributor Pete Hegseth asked Trump, "Isn't it just fair to say, These are the rules, Ted Cruz is organized, and you're just flat-out being out-organized?" Trump disagreed, saying, he has "out-organized" Cruz because "I have millions of more votes" and more delegates. Like many state caucuses, Colorado’s is a complex and arcane maze for newcomers to navigate. But was the Colorado system "rigged" and a "crooked deal" that deprived people of their vote, as Trump claimed? Confusing as they are, the rules for the caucus were changed in August 2015, two months after Trump entered the presidential race. And there’s no evidence the tweaks were made to disenfranchise Trump. Let’s dig deeper. Trump has performed better in states with primary elections, where his supporters can simply vote at their regular neighborhood polling place. But the Republican frontrunner’s campaign has struggled in state caucuses because it has lacked a strong ground game to shepherd voters through bewildering caucus gatherings that are rife with rules. When Trump said there was "no voting" at the Colorado caucuses, he was referring to an August 2015 decision by the state GOP's executive committee, which unanimously voted to abandon a presidential preference poll at this year’s precinct caucuses. The committee said it was reacting to the national party changing its rules to bind state delegates to the caucus winner — potentially leaving delegates tied to a candidate who later dropped out of the race. Yet, Trump is wrong in saying there was "no voting" at the caucuses. About 60,000 Republicans attended the state precinct caucuses. People voted at every level of the delegate selection process. The multistep Colorado GOP caucus process began March 1, when party members selected delegates at precinct caucuses. Those delegates moved on to higher-level gatherings before delegates for the Republican National Convention were selected at district assemblies and the April 9 state convention. Cruz, whose campaign had been building an organization in Colorado since January, was the only GOP presidential candidate to address the state convention. He grabbed all 34 delegates. Trump supporters, however, describe a problem-plagued process at the state convention. At a protest outside the Colorado Capitol building on Friday, April 15, about 200 Trump backers said their votes were "stolen." Some claimed they were misinformed and even lied to during the caucuses. The confusion continued at the state convention. Party organizers left about 30 delegates off the ballot and had to send out a correction sheet just before the convention vote. At least one Cruz delegate was entered twice on the ballot, replacing a Trump delegate, said Gabriel Schwartz, a Trump backer and state convention veteran. "Very obvious there was gross incompetence at the state (GOP) level," Schwartz told KMGH-TV. State GOP officials called the snafus a few "clerical errors" that didn’t impact the convention’s outcome. A Denver Post editorial said the Colorado Republican Party’s process for selecting presidential delegates "ranked among the least representative of all states." The editorial based its finding on the caucuses’ delegate-to-voter ratio — roughly 1 to 1,714 — and a national analysis by FiveThirtyEight.com. "In short, Colorado Republican leaders got what they wanted when they abandoned a presidential preference poll at the caucus. An extremely narrow base of activists and insiders chose the delegates in a process that ranked among the least representative and democratic in the country," the editorial said. However, the editorial still concluded, "Not that Donald Trump and his supporters have any ground for their complaints. As we've said before, they knew the rules." Even some Trump backers were disappointed by the campaign’s weak effort in Colorado. Trump delegate Larry Lindsey posted a YouTube that went viral of him fuming about being denied entrance to the state convention and burning his Republican party registration paper. Lindsey said he later learned that he was ineligible for the convention because he’d missed a county caucus vote. Yet, he said, someone told him the meeting was postponed. "The (Trump) organization here in Colorado was definitely lacking. I have to admit that, reluctantly," Lindsey told PolitiFact. University of Denver political scientist Peter Hanson said Cruz’s win in Colorado is a reminder that a good ground game matters. "Organization is key," Hanson told KMGH-TV. "It's one thing for a candidate to give a speech to a rally and think that their work is done. That's just not the way it works." U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., who endorsed Sen. Marco Rubio, issued a sharp rebuttal to Trump’s criticism of the state caucus system. "Donald Trump, who has known the rules since last August, he decided not to show up. Elections are won by those who show up and Ted Cruz showed up," Gardner told Fox News. Our ruling Trump said the Colorado GOP’s caucus system is "rigged" and "crooked." There are plenty of problems with Colorado’s caucus system. The delegate selection process is dominated by party activists and insiders, and this year’s caucuses were hampered -- at best -- by confusion and technical glitches. But Trump is complaining about rules that were in place eight months ago, when the Republican presidential race was clogged with 17 candidates. There is no evidence the rules were designed to favor a specific candidate. His campaign took a pass on the Colorado caucuses, focusing instead on the delegate-rich New York primary, while Cruz ran an exhaustive ground game in the Centennial State. We rate his claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/10e606f7-fc56-4d69-9c82-562b82fdb45b	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-04-19T18:20:59	2016-04-11	['Colorado', 'Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-03462	"Worldwide credit card transactions, the credit card fraud rate is 0.04 percent, compared to almost 8 percent, 9 percent, 10 percent of Medicare fraud."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jun/17/peter-roskam/rep-roskam-says-medicare-fraud-rate-8-10-percent/	Fraud by its very nature tries to hide from view. So when Rep. Peter Roskam, R-Ill., talked about how big the problem is for the Medicare program, he gave himself some wiggle room. Roskam was talking to Fox News about a bill he has that would borrow tools used in the credit card industry to pare down the tens of billions of dollars that criminal gangs and unscrupulous operators pocket from the federal government’s health care program for the elderly. "Worldwide credit card transactions, the credit card fraud rate is 0.04 percent," Roskam told Fox News. "Compared to almost 8 percent, 9 percent, 10 percent of Medicare fraud." When PolitiFact checked the size of Medicare fraud five years ago, we quickly discovered that hard and fast numbers are hard to come by. In this fact-check, we’ll examine Roskam’s estimate of 8 to 10 percent and see what sources he relies on. Before we dive into Medicare fraud, a review of credit card studies shows that Roskam is pretty much on the mark when he speaks of a 0.04 percent rate. A 2010 report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City gives a fraud rate of 0.05 percent for U.S. issued cards, both debit and credit. Roskam’s office pointed us to a trade publication, the Nilson Report, that cites an international rate of 0.04 percent rate. On Medicare, Roskam’s office cited a Government Accountability Office report, a watchdog website created by an executive order from President Barack Obama, and an article from the U.S. Administration on Aging. All three give us rates that range from 7.9 percent to 8.5 percent for the largest Medicare program, and up to 11 percent for a smaller program, Medicare Advantage. While the fraud rates fall into Roskam’s range, none of them is talking about fraud alone. Rather, they address the much broader category of improper payments. If a doctor orders too many tests, or provides a service but submits the wrong payment code, those come under the umbrella of improper payments. Out and out fraud is not as large as improper payments, but it can be egregious. The FBI recently charged 25 people in Miami for allegedly bribing Medicare beneficiaries and then using their account numbers to bill for services that were unnecessary or never provided. The government says the scheme netted the conspirators about $44 million. Malcolm Sparrow, professor of public management and a specialist in corruption control at Harvard’s Kennedy School, told us that fraud and improper payments are far from identical. "There is a serious problem with conflating these different types of overpayment," Sparrow said. "They are quite different in origin and require very different types of control mechanisms." When we raised this with Roskam’s office, his staff sent us several examples where Roskam has spoken collectively of fraud, waste and abuse. On Fox News, however, he spoke only of fraud. PolitiFact also found a study that restores a measure of credibility to Roskam’s estimate. Donald Berwick, a former head of the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services or CMS, the agency that runs Medicare, collaborated with an analyst at RAND to produce a landmark paper in 2012 in JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association. That paper offers three estimates of fraud in the Medicare and Medicaid programs: a low of 3 percent, a medium of 6 percent and a high of 10 percent. CMS told us they have no official estimate of fraud but pointed us to this study, and they cited FBI figures that mirror the numbers in this paper. If it turns out that the high end of the range in the JAMA article is correct, then Roskam is in the right ballpark. Of course, nobody knows for sure because fraud is a crime, and criminals don’t advertise their work. Two caveats for policy makers The JAMA article doesn’t stop at Medicare and Medicaid. It also looks at fraud in the health care sector as a whole, both public and private. The fraud rates don’t change much when the private sector is included. For Sparrow at Harvard, this is no surprise. "The systems and structures they use for control are the same, across public, private, and not-for-profit programs," Sparrow said. "They all tend to share the same strengths and weaknesses, and are roughly equally vulnerable." Put another way, the nature of the American health care system lends itself to a certain level of fraud, and the Medicare program is no more and no less susceptible to this type of crime. Sparrow says this also suggests the comparison to the credit card industry might be less useful than might appear. In the first place, the transactions are much simpler. When a thief tries a scam with a credit card, the card holder tends to notice by the next bill. In general, this kind of fraud is more easily detected and tracked. But Sparrow says there’s a bigger difference. "The losses are borne by banks," he said. That creates a powerful incentive, in real time, to control the problem. In health care, the incentives are "more diffuse and ambiguous." Our ruling Roskam said the Medicare fraud rate is 8 to 10 percent. His office pointed us to various documents that analyzed the problem of improper payments, an issue that mixes fraud together with nominally legal activities such as referring patients for more tests than are necessary. This suggested Roskam was using an inflated estimate of fraud. However, a recent study tends, in the worst-case analysis, to support Roskam’s figures. Roskam’s comparison to credit cards overlooks many key differences between the structures of the health care and credit card industries, and it tends to obscure the systematic nature of fraud in health care, whether public or private. But Roskam is right that credit card fraud is a tiny percentage of all transactions. We rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Peter Roskam	None	None	None	2013-06-17T15:53:24	2013-06-12	['None']
pomt-08879	During the recession, "the consumer in his native perversity has begun to save. The savings rate is now 6.2 percent."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/02/george-will/george-will-says-personal-saving-rate-has-increase/	During the Aug. 1, 2010, roundtable on ABC's This Week, host Christiane Amanpour asked panelists about the current levels of slow growth in the United States economy. "Growth is happening," Amanpour said, "but at 2.4 percent, which is slower than most people wanted. I see you shaking your head in this debate. The Financial Times is basically saying that the deficit talk is a phony, rhetorical war and that actually stimulus has had some effect." She turned to George Will, the conservative columnist, who had been shaking his head. "Well, the recovery is now more than a year old, and we know two things about it," Will said. "It's unusually weak for a recovery after a severe downturn, and, B, starting weak, it's getting weaker, for two reasons. First of all, the stimulus is running out. ... Cash for Clunkers has come and gone. The homebuyer's tax credit for purchasing new -- particularly new homes, come and gone. Second, the growth so far has been largely driven by inventories, businesses rebuilding their inventories in anticipation of the consumer -- 70 percent of business activity in a normal time -- coming back to the malls. The trouble is, the consumer in his native perversity has begun to save. The savings rate is now 6.2 percent. So what you have is what I think Keynes called the paradox of thrift. ... It's a virtue until it isn't a virtue." We thought it would be worthwhile to check whether the savings rate has in fact risen to 6.2 percent during the recession. Checking the number itself was easy. We looked to the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis, which tracks the personal saving rate, which it defines as the percentage of personal disposable income that is saved. The data shows that during the second quarter of 2010, the personal saving rate was about 6.2 percent, just as Will had said. Will is also right to suggest that the rate has risen. The current rate is the second highest it has been in any quarter since at least 2004, which is the earliest data BEA offers on the chart we found. Prior to the start of the recession in 2008, the saving rate was typically below 4 percent, and much of the time it was below 2 percent. In other words, consumers today are hoarding significantly more of their income than they were during the go-go days of high real estate values, easy credit and a steadily growing economy. So Will is right on the facts. But we were also intrigued about whether the higher savings rate has hampered the nation's economic recovery, as he suggests. Let's begin by explaining the "paradox of thrift" that Will cited. The major tenet is that when people save a lot of money, rather than spend it, they help their own bottom lines -- but that if everyone follows that approach, then everybody loses. According to the theory, the money saved doesn't get injected into the economy, where it would boost production and profits and help create jobs. In other words, a higher personal savings rate, like the one Will is talking about, can actually hurt the economy even as it helps individuals live within their means and hedge against personal economic setbacks. We checked with a cross-section of economists to see whether they thought this theory -- which was popularized by left-of-center economist John Maynard Keynes -- is generally considered accurate today. The experts we talked to said that it has broad, but not universal, approval. Most of the skepticism about the paradox of thrift has come from the right. Conservative economist Dan Mitchell of the libertarian Cato Institute said that free-market economics doesn't dispute that higher saving leads to lower consumption, but it places less importance on that shift. Free-marketers say that as long as the national income is growing, then the displacement of consumption by savings doesn't matter that much. J.D. Foster, a senior fellow with the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that when Keynes popularized the concept in the early 20th century, the money that was "saved" was actually stuck in the proverbial mattress, at which point it really did leave the economic system. By contrast, there are many relatively safe options for parking one's money today, even accounting for the shakiness in the financial sector since 2008. And if a higher savings rate means that people are putting their money into banks or other safe investments, that money makes its way back into the economy as capital available to lend. In turn, greater availability of loans can help juice the economy. That said, there are still many defenders of the original Keynesian view of the paradox of thrift. They cite real-world evidence from the past few years, in which investment has fallen compared to pre-recession levels despite historically low interest rates. "Businesses and households evidently do not want to invest as much in 2010 as they did in 2007" because they're not confident those investments will pay off, said Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution. "Of course, one reason for their lack of confidence is the very slow growth in household consumption, which is a byproduct of the rise in household saving rates. On the surface, then, the facts tend to support the broad version of the paradox of thrift. The jump in the household saving rate has thus been harmful to economic growth, at least in the short run." We'll acknowledge that there's a difference of opinion in how economists view the impact of the saving rate's growth during the recession. But on Will's core factual assertion -- that the savings rate has climbed during the recession -- he's correct. So we rate his statement True.

pomt-01648	"We’ve seen highway fatalities actually decrease in Colorado" since marijuana use was legalized.	half-true	/oregon/statements/2014/aug/22/anthony-johnson/have-colorado-highway-fatalities-decreased-marijua/	Oregon voters will have the chance in November to join only Colorado and Washington as states where recreational use of marijuana is legal. Not surprisingly, the issue is already heating up, with those for and against staking out positions they hope will sway voters on Measure 91. The claim: Anthony Johnson, the measure’s chief petitioner and director of the advocacy group New Approach Oregon, made his pitch recently when the City Club of Portland met to debate the merits of nine political issues, legal marijuana among them. When an opposition speaker questioned why Oregon should follow the lead of Colorado and Washington into the relatively uncharted territory of legal pot, Johnson noted the pluses of regulation and taxation. Addressing opposition predictions that driving accidents would spike in those states, he added, "We've seen highway fatalities actually decrease in Colorado" since recreational use of marijuana became legal there in January. Since the effect legalization might have on impaired driving is a big topic in Oregon in the lead up to November, PolitiFact Oregon checked the numbers. The analysis: Colorado’s medical marijuana law took effect in 2002, giving the Centennial State a relatively long history of dealing with the drug in an other-than-illegal capacity. However, recreational use has been in effect for only seven months, making any numbers suspect in terms of how longer-term trends might play out. That said, we figured that comparing the number of traffic fatalities recorded during the first seven months of this year with the first seven of 2013 would the fairest way to evaluate Johnson’s claim. We called Emily Wilfong, a Colorado Department of Transportation spokeswoman. As of Aug. 22, 2014, she said, 295 people had died in motor vehicle crashes in the state. That compared with the 313 deaths reported as of the same time a year ago. A difference, yes, but one of less than six percent. But even so, Wilfong added, those two figures don’t reveal a useful picture when it comes to assessing traffic deaths in the age of legal marijuana. For starters, neither figure includes the icy dangers of Colorado’s winter driving season, which begins around mid- to late-October, she said. Hazardous conditions could easily skew the number of traffic fatalities dramatically. For another, neither includes an analysis of exactly how the deaths occurred. "There could well be a big decrease in the number of pedestrian fatalities," Wilfong said. "There’s nothing in these figures to show that impaired driving has been reduced to any measurable degree." Muddying the numbers further is the fact that toxicology reports showing what drivers had in their systems may not come back for months, she said. "So we have some numbers," Wilfong said, "but we’re not at all certain what they mean at this point. It’s way too early to tell." Trooper Josh Lewis, Wilfong’s Colorado State Patrol counterpart, agreed. "Statistically, we’re essentially neck and neck with last year," he said. "But there’s nothing to say that marijuana use is reducing the number of fatalities or that there’s any correlation between the two. It could well be months or years before we have gathered that sort of data." We tried to reach Johnson, but were told he was out of the office. The Yes on 91 campaign referred us to Art Way, senior drug policy manager of the Drug Policy Alliance (Colorado). Over the past decade, he said -- or roughly the time that Colorado began loosening its marijuana laws -- total highway fatalities are down. Statistics bear that out, but the margin is slim and there are other factors such as improvements in vehicle safety and trauma medicine. The ruling: Anthony Johnson, chief petitioner for Measure 91, which would legalize recreational marijuana use in Oregon, pointed to Colorado’s brief seven-month experience with legal pot and noted that traffic fatalities have decreased there over that stretch. Colorado’s most recent statistics show that 18 fewer people have died so far this year in fatal traffic accidents than did during that same time period in 2013. Nothing in those numbers, however, supports any contention that legal marijuana had anything to do with a drop that’s as much as a blip as anything. Johnson’s statement is true, but it omits important details and context. We rate it Half True. Thoughts on our ruling? Click on over to OregonLive/politics.com and leave your comments. (This fact-check has been edited. An earlier version mischaracterized one of Anthony Johnson's arguments regarding driving and recreational marijuana. It did not change the ruling.)

pomt-03320	The Republican-authored state budget includes a provision "forcing people earning as little as $12,000 to buy private health insurance that could cost them as much as $4,000 per year."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jul/26/dave-hansen/wisconsin-sen-dave-hansen-says-state-budget-forces/	Work on the Republican-authored state budget is all over, capped by Gov. Scott Walker’s signature June 30, 2013. But the shouting continues. State Sen. Dave Hansen (D-Green Bay) protested after the Associated Press reported that a GOP real-estate agent wrote to Walker about buying state office buildings while the Legislature considered Walker’s budget -- which ended competitive bidding for such sales. "The ink on the budget wasn’t even dry," Hansen claimed in a July 19, 2013 news release, "before one of these wealthy Republican donors was angling for a sweetheart deal from a political party that appears all too eager to reward their friends." Hansen included an income-tax break and an expanded voucher-school program among the "rewards," but it was a health-care claim on Hansen’s list that caught our eye. The GOP budget, he said, included a move "forcing people earning as little as $12,000 to buy private health insurance that could cost them as much as $4,000 per year." So, by Hansen’s calculation, the state budget means low-income people will be pushed into the private market and find themselves spending fully one-third of their income on health care. Hansen is talking about Walker’s controversial decision to reject the federal Medicaid expansion and instead require some 90,000 poor people to get coverage from the new private insurance marketplaces, known as exchanges, under Obamacare. Critics, including Democrats such as Hansen, said that despite federal subsidies a chunk of those people would not be able to afford private insurance from the exchanges. Currently, those people have very limited out-of-pocket costs under the state’s BadgerCare Plus health program. Hansen, in his blast at the budget, puts a hard number on the challenge facing some people with his $12,000/$4,000 scenario. The two numbers are familiar to experts who track how the Obamacare exchanges will work in Wisconsin. At an income of $12,000 -- just above the federal poverty line of $11,490 -- an individual will no longer be eligible for state BadgerCare coverage and will have to move into the federal exchanges. The $4,000 is a worst-case scenario figure for out-of-pocket costs in the exchanges for a family of two with a household income of up to 200 percent of the official federal poverty level, notes Jon Peacock, research director at the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families, a liberal advocacy and research group. But Hansen muffs the illustration using the two figures. One big problem is he mixes an income level for one person with the costs facing a household of two. A single person with an income of $12,000 would pay about $240 a year in insurance premiums, and if serious health problems arise could pay up to an additional $2,100 in out-of-pocket costs (deductibles, co-pays and co-insurance), said Peacock and Sonya Schwartz, a member of the research faculty at Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families. That adds up to a possible total outlay of almost $2,400 -- one-fifth of the cited income -- not the $4,000 or one-third that Hansen says. No small change in either case, but it makes for a big difference. A couple of final notes. The $4,000 cost figure Hansen cites could come into play for married couples, for instance, but only if their combined income was above $15,510 -- higher than the $12,000 Hansen cites. Most of the people who would be moved from BadgerCare, though, would be single parents with custody of a child. The child would stay on BadgerCare, however. The maximum costs for a parent who is right at the poverty level would be around $2,400. They jump up to over $4,000 for a single parent making $30,000, Peacock said. So, Hansen’s specific example is significantly off the mark -- and that’s especially problematic because he’s talking about the worst-case scenario to begin with. Our rating Hansen sought to highlight the biggest impact on a group of poor people when he said the Republican move will have the effect of "forcing people earning as little as $12,000 to buy private health insurance that could cost them as much as $4,000 per year." But Hansen errs in the example and significantly overstates the effect. We rate his claim False.	None	Dave Hansen	None	None	None	2013-07-26T05:00:00	2013-07-19	['None']
pomt-02452	"Travis County now has the highest urban county tax rate in Texas."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2014/feb/26/andy-brown/travis-countys-tax-rate-ranks-among-very-highest-a/	It’s not unusual for a candidate to bemoan taxes. Still, Andy Brown’s claim in a mailer stopped us short: "Travis County now has the highest urban county tax rate in Texas." Brown, an Austin lawyer running for Travis County judge, aired his statement under an arrow suggesting county tax bills steadily escalated while his Democratic primary opponent, Sarah Eckhardt, served on the Travis County Commissioners Court. We’re focusing here on whether the county has the highest tax rate of the state’s urban counties. By email, Brown’s campaign manager, Jim Wick, told us the campaign compared the 2012 total tax rate for Travis County with the rate in other counties that are home to the state’s five largest cities. Wick included a chart indicating that in this subset, the Travis County rate of $0.5001 per $100 property valuation exceeded the rates in Harris, Dallas, Tarrant, Bexar and El Paso counties. El Paso County, Brown’s chart indicates, had the next-highest rate, $0.40887 per $100 valuation. "Since there is no statutory definition of an urban county, we defined it as a county that has a ‘big city’ in it that is often compared to other big cities around Texas," Wick wrote. By phone, he said: "We were trying to compare apples to apples." We took our own, broader look. Online, the Texas Association of Counties drew on data collected by the state comptroller’s office to create a chart listing the "general fund property tax rates" for every Texas county for 1996 through 2012. Among the 15 most populous counties, the chart and our own web research suggested that in 2012 and 2013, Travis County had the second-highest total property tax rate--topped only by Hidalgo County, which is home to McAllen near the Texas-Mexico border. Hidalgo County’s rate of $0.59 per $100 valuation in 2012 and 2013 compared with Travis County’s respective rates of $0.5001 and $0.4946 per $100 valuation. Among these 15 counties, Travis-neighboring Williamson County had the third-highest 2013 rate, $0.49029 per $100 valuation. Travis County’s rates in 2012 and 2013 far outpaced the total rates in the state’s four more populous counties. In this subgroup, the next-closest 2013 rate--$0.40021 per $100 valuation--was levied by the most populous county, Harris. The other more populous counties and their total tax rates: Dallas ($0.2431 per $100 valuation); Tarrant ($0.2640 per $100 valuation); and Bexar ($0.296187 per $100 valuation). MOST POPULOUS TEXAS COUNTIES TOTAL PROPERTY TAX RATE in DOLLARS PER $100 VALUATION, 2012 TOTAL PROPERTY TAX RATE in DOLLARS PER $100 VALUATION, 2013 Harris 0.40021 0.40021 Dallas 0.2431 0.2431 Tarrant 0.264 0.264 Bexar 0.326866 0.296187 Travis 0.5001 0.4946 El Paso 0.40887 0.43 Collin 0.24 0.2375 Hidalgo 0.59 0.59 Denton 0.282867 0.284914 Fort Bend 0.48076 0.48476 Montgomery 0.4838 0.4838 Williamson 0.49029 0.49029 Cameron 0.384291 0.384291 Nueces 0.355259 0.340999 Brazoria 0.48586 0.43202 Sources: Web page, "Texas Total County Property Tax Rates 1996 - 2012," Texas Association of Counties; Web page, "Harris County, Truth in Taxation Summary;" Document, "2013 AD VALOREM TAX RATES FOR DALLAS COUNTY;" Web page, "Tarrant County, Rates and Exemptions;" Web page, "2013 Official Tax Rates & Exemptions," Bexar County Tax Assessor-Collector; Web page, "Truth in Taxation Summary," Travis County; News story, "El Paso County Commissioners Court adopted a 2-cent tax increase," El Paso Times, Sept. 24, 2013; Chart, "TAX RATE HISTORY," Collin County Tax Assessor-Collector; Chart, "41 HIDALGO COUNTY TAX OFFICE 2013 TAX RATE SCHEDULE," Hidalgo County; Telephone interview, Stacey Dvoracek, chief deputy, Denton County Tax Assessor-Collector, Feb. 24, 2014; Web page, "2013 Fort Bend Tax Rates," Fort Bend County; Web page, "Tax Rate Information," Montgomery County; Web page, "Tax Rate Information," Williamson County; Chart, "2013 Jurisdiction Tax Rates," Cameron County Appraisal District; Chart, "2013 Nueces County Tax Rates," Nueces County; Chart, "Brazoria County Tax Rates," Brazoria County Appraisal District We noticed another wrinkle in that Travis County has long had one of the highest tax rates among the urban counties. There wasn’t a change in this respect in Eckhardt’s time as a commissioner. According to the information compiled by the counties’ association, Travis County had the highest total rate among the five most populous counties every year from 1996 through 2012. Travis County’s total rate even exceeded the Hidalgo County rate from 1996 through 1999, the chart indicates, though Hidalgo has had a higher rate every year since. When we pointed this out, Wick told us the mailer’s use of "now" was intended to mean at "this very moment." Finally, it’s worth noting that however the county’s tax rate compares to others, it would take more research to tell whether Austin-area residents pay more in property taxes than other Texans. Each local resident’s tab includes taxes collected by governmental entities including, perhaps, the city of Austin and a school district. Our ruling Brown said Travis County now has the highest urban county tax rate in Texas. Travis County had the second-highest total property tax rate of the state’s 15 most populous counties in 2012 and 2013, we found, also levying the highest rate of the state’s seven most populous counties. But in contrast to Brown’s message, Travis County's tip-top ranking isn't new. The county’s rate has exceeded the rates of more populous counties every year since 1996. We rate this claim, which lacked these clarifications, as Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-07950	"As many as a quarter of our students aren’t even finishing high school."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/25/barack-obama/barack-obama-state-union-says-quarter-us-high-scho/	In his State of the Union address on Jan. 25, 2011, President Barack Obama advocated investments in both physical and human capital. But he said the nation’s rates of educational achievement were falling short. "Over the next 10 years, nearly half of all new jobs will require education that goes beyond a high school degree," Obama said. "And yet, as many as a quarter of our students aren’t even finishing high school." We looked at this question last year, when Education Secretary Arne Duncan offered a similar statistic on the Aug 29, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour during a discussion of education policy. "In this country, we have a 25 percent dropout rate," he said. "That's 1.2 million students leaving our schools for the streets every single year. That is economically unsustainable, and that is morally unacceptable." We wondered whether it was really true that one of every four American high school students drops out before graduating. We concluded that while Duncan used a commonly cited statistic, education experts we contacted cautioned that it's an imperfect measurement. First, a bit about the complex world of measuring dropout rates, drawing liberally from a prior article by our colleagues at PolitiFact Texas. Researchers and governments have many different ways of measuring how many students leave school before graduating. "A dropout rate seems like it should be the most intuitive thing in the world, but it’s not," said David Bills, a professor at the University of Iowa College of Education who specializes in comparative statistics. "There are almost as many ways of calculating state dropout rates as there are states." One way to calculate it is to track individual students as they progress from freshman year of high school until graduation. This provides the most accurate data, but tracking students this way requires a lot of effort, so many school districts do not do it. The main alternative is to track the decline in enrollment between freshman year and graduation. This is known as the AFGR, or averaged freshman graduation rate. It's much easier to do -- and it's the most consistent "apples to apples" statistic across the 50 states -- but it is undermined by a greater risk of error. That's because AFGR does not necessarily distinguish between students who actually dropped out and those who left for other reasons, such as moving to a school in another state, leaving to follow one's parents to a new military assignment, graduating early or graduating late. "If a kid leaves one school but is never tracked if he enrolls in another school, that can count as a dropout," Bills said. "Also, a lot of kids who leave high school but later get GEDs are often counted as dropouts. And sometimes dropout rates are calculated as the number of people aged 16-24 not in school and without a degree, which can also inflate the number." Students who leave for other reasons can be excluded, but this is not always done, and not doing it tends to inflate the apparent number of dropouts. Standardization mandated by provisions of the No Child Left Behind Act has reduced these errors over time, but the statistics are not yet perfect, our experts said. And, needless to say, analyzing different data with different methods will inevitably yield varying results. To add to the confusion, any of the measurements cited above might be termed the "dropout" rate in public discourse. At the Education Department, we spoke to Tracy Dell'Angela, director of outreach and communications with the Institute of Education Sciences, which oversees the department's National Center for Education Statistics, which among other things calculates AFGR. She said that when Duncan talks about the dropout rate, he tends to subtract the AFGR (nearly 75 percent for the last available year, 2007-2008) from a full student universe of 100 percent to get a 25 percent dropout rate. In one sense, Duncan was on solid ground -- his calculation is certainly a common way to use the statistics. But the numbers require some important caveats. In addition to the issue of transfer students cited earlier, the statistics do not necessarily treat home schoolers accurately (they may be counted as dropouts if they begin home schooling after 9th grade and eventually graduate from home school). In addition, Education Department data has sometimes left out entire states, including South Carolina in 2007-2008. Also, the AFGR statistics only refer to public school students. In fact, there is no comprehensive data on graduation and dropout rates from private schools, which account for about 8 to 9 percent of high school students. Since parents paying tuition are likely to be especially motivated to see their children finish school, the true national dropout rate reported probably overstates the actual percentage of American children failing to graduate from high school. We ended up rating Duncan’s comment Half True, noting that while we understood the need for simplicity in a televised interview, Duncan could have easily said the dropout rate "may be as high as 25 percent." In fact, Obama in his State of the Union address did essentially that, prefacing the statistic by saying that "as many as a quarter of our students aren’t even finishing high school." We still think the 25 percent statistic is undermined by a variety of problems, but we give Obama credit for offering a range. So we find his claim Mostly True.

pomt-12674	Wisconsin is "the most -- if not Number 1, number 2 -- gerrymandered state in the country" for state legislative boundaries.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/mar/17/dave-hansen/attacking-republicans-democratic-state-senator-say/	A federal court has ruled that boundaries drawn by Wisconsin Republicans in 2011 for state legislative districts were so excessively partisan as to be unconstitutional. Two months later, in January 2017, the three-judge panel ordered Republican Gov. Scott Walker and the GOP-controlled Legislature to redraw the districts (the state is appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court). Understandably, Democrats have cried foul. One of them, state Sen. Dave Hansen of Green Bay, went so far as to declare in a March 5, 2017 TV interview: "We are the most -- if not Number 1, Number 2 -- gerrymandered state in the country." Is he right? The court case Boundaries for the state Assembly and state Senate (as well as for Wisconsin’s congressional districts) are redrawn every 10 years -- by the state Legislature itself, which can lead to problems. As the Harvard Political Review has observed generally about redistricting, which is done by the legislature in most states: "Allowing partisan legislators to redraw their own districts creates a clear conflict of interest, and historically the temptation to game the system has proven too great to resist for the majority party." The federal court said the Wisconsin state legislative maps drawn in 2011 by Republicans were among the most heavily skewed to one party of any plan in the country going back more than 40 years. One of the goals, the court concluded, "was to secure Republican control of the Assembly under any likely future electoral scenario for the remainder of the decade, in other words to entrench the Republican Party in power." The Washington Post’s "The Fix" blog called Wisconsin one of the most gerrymandered states in the nation, noting that in 2012, Democratic candidates for the state Assembly received more votes than Republicans, but won just 39 of 99 districts. The blog said the court’s ruling was the first time in a decade that a court has thrown out legislative maps because they favored voters of one party over another. The new boundaries have been reflected in election results. As Craig Gilbert, author of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s Wisconsin Voter blog, has reported: 2012: Republicans got only 46 percent of the presidential vote in Wisconsin, but won 60 percent of the seats in the state Assembly. 2014: Republicans got just over 52 percent of the vote for governor, but captured 63 percent of the Assembly seats. 2016: Donald Trump won 50.4 percent of the vote for president, but won 64 percent of the Assembly seats. Viewed another way, according to political scientists at Binghamton University: Wisconsin Democrats probably have to win about 55 to 56 percent of the statewide vote to win control of the state Assembly, while Republicans need only win 44 to 45 percent. And Theodore Arrington, a professor emeritus of political science at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, agreed that depending on how gerrymandering is measured, Wisconsin is among the worst states. So, the Wisconsin state legislative maps stand as an outlier. How Wisconsin compares to others isn’t a precise calculation, but it stands out in that way, too. Ranking states To back Hansen’s claim, his office pointed us to a column that reported on a 2015 study by Simon Jackman, who at the time was a political science professor at Stanford University. (He is now CEO of the US Studies Centre at the University of Sydney.) Jackman was hired by the plaintiffs in the federal court case. He studied 41 states, not all 50, and ranked Wisconsin’s map as the fifth-worst: North Carolina Virginia Michigan Florida Wisconsin Wisconsin ranked higher, however, in a 2014 study we found that was led by University of Chicago law professor and redistricting expert Nicholas Stephanopoulos: Wyoming Wisconsin Oklahoma Virginia Florida Both studies used a measure called the "efficiency gap," a number that is arrived at through an equation. That is, the difference between each party's "wasted" votes in an election -- where votes are wasted if they are cast for a losing candidate, or for a winning candidate but in excess of what the candidate needed to win -- divided by the total number of votes cast. Stephanopoulos told us Wisconsin’s ranking differs in the two studies because the studies treated uncontested races differently. But whether Wisconsin ranks fifth or second "is just a matter of a percentage point or two, and is substantively irrelevant," he said. There are some caveats, though, as other redistricting experts noted. Charles Hampton, an emeritus professor of mathematical sciences at Wooster College in Ohio, said he thought the second study was too dependent on vote totals in its analysis and not on the redistricting plan itself. Michael Li, who is senior counsel for the Brennan Center for Justice Democracy Program at New York University School of Law, told us the "partisan biases" found in the studies can be largely but not completely explained by gerrymandering. But he said political geography -- for example, Democrats tending to live in big cities -- also explains some of the disparity in Wisconsin. Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles who maintains a website on redistricting, cautioned that "there are no universally agreed-upon rankings, in part because gerrymandering usually describes an unfair drawing of the lines, and there's no universally agreed-upon sense of what's fair, or what's fair for what purposes." Our rating Hansen says Wisconsin is "the most -- if not Number 1, Number 2 -- gerrymandered state in the country" for state legislative boundaries. A federal court has said maps drawn in 2011 by Wisconsin Republicans were among the most heavily skewed to one party of any plan in the country going back more than 40 years. And, with the caveat that there isn’t a universally accepted definition of gerrymander, two studies put Wisconsin at or near the top. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-05050	Says Mitt Romney "has a corporation in Bermuda (but) failed to disclose that on seven different financial disclosures."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/10/robert-gibbs/democrats-say-mitt-romney-failed-disclose-offshore/	In the Democratic playbook, the more attention paid to Mitt Romney’s wealth, the better. Over the past few days, many Democrats questioned whether Romney used offshore holdings to dodge U.S. taxes and pressed him to release more of his personal financial information. Obama campaign senior adviser Robert Gibbs took the occasion during CNN’s State of the Union to say, "Nobody knows why he has a corporation in Bermuda, why he failed to disclose that on seven different financial disclosures." We wondered if Gibbs had his facts right. Does Romney currently have a stake in a Bermuda corporation? And did he fail to disclose it seven times? Reporting by the Associated Press and Vanity Fair teed this up. Both news organizations explored one of Romney’s overseas accounts, Sankaty High Yield Asset Investors, Ltd. The firm is described in SEC filings as "a Bermuda corporation wholly owned by W. Mitt Romney." (For more details, check out the AP's interesting account.) In his 2010 tax return and his 2011 estimated filing, Romney includes Sankaty High Yield Asset Investors, Ltd. The beginning balance is pegged at $10,432. He and his wife Ann are the sole owners. According to the Associated Press, Romney ran his investments in other Bain Capital deals through this offshore corporation. Democrats have pounced on the issue. Offshore holdings might be perfectly legal, but they also might paint Romney as one of the super-rich who may be using an offshore tax shelter. Romney’s ownership of Sankaty is not in doubt, at least not as recently as this past December, according to Romney’s 2011 estimated tax return. So Gibbs appears to be on solid ground that Romney has the company now. We asked the Romney campaign if they could give us more current information on the status of Sankaty High Yield Asset Investors, but they did not respond. In an interview with Radio Iowa on Monday, Romney deflected the issue, saying his foreign investments are in a blind trust. "I don’t manage them. I don’t even know where they are," Romney said. "That trustee follows all U.S. laws. All the taxes are paid, as appropriate. All of them have been reported to the government. There’s nothing hidden there." As for Gibbs’ other assertion that Romney has failed to disclose his stake in Sankaty seven times, that also is largely accurate. We counted six disclosure forms where Romney made no reference at all to the Bermuda corporation. Those include his filings in Massachusetts when he was running for governor or holding office and his federal disclosures for his presidential bids. The seventh appears to be his 2001 disclosure, which lists Sankaty High Yield Asset Investors LLC. Note the slight difference in those three letters -- LLC instead of Ltd. The LLC, a limited liability corporation he named on the form, is based in Delaware. The offshore corporation by the same name ends in Ltd. and there is no mention of it until Romney’s lawyers began amending his disclosures this year. There is some question whether he was required to disclose this asset. In 2003, on the eve of running for governor, he put Sankaty into a blind trust. Thereafter, he disclosed the presence of the trust and might not have been required to say what was in it. It is also unclear whether the nominal value of Sankaty would be high enough to warrant disclosure. In 2011, its value was $10,432. However, as the Associated Press pointed out, that could well ignore the potential income that might flow through the fund. It is possible for investments made many years ago to produce over $1 million in payoffs that suddenly appear on the books. Our ruling Obama campaign adviser Robert Gibbs said Romney owns a Bermuda-based corporation and that he failed to disclose his ownership seven times. The documentary evidence indicates Gibbs is right that Romney owned it when he filed his estimated tax return in December and that he did not disclose it earlier. The Romney campaign has not said the statements are wrong. We rate Gibbs claim True. UPDATE -- We may have had the lyrics to Kokomo in our heads ("Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama...") because twice in this article we referred to the Bahamas when we meant Bermuda. We've corrected the mistakes, although we still can't get the song our of our head.	None	Robert Gibbs	None	None	None	2012-07-10T15:59:40	2012-07-08	['None']
pomt-03155	The Libertarian Party "is the third-largest political party in the U.S."	false	/florida/statements/2013/sep/09/libertarian-party-broward-county/libertarians-say-theyre-third-largest-political-pa/	In politics -- or any blood sport -- it’s rare to hear a team proudly chant, "We’re No. 3! We’re No. 3!" But that’s what we heard from Libertarians in the purple state of Florida. We spotted a claim about the numbers and growth of libertarians in an announcement about a Libertarian event in Broward County: "The Libertarian Party is the third-largest organized political party in the United States and has seen tremendous growth over the last two years as many Democrats and Republicans have become disenchanted with their respective parties." (The article was written by Karl Dickey who serves on the Libertarian Party of Florida’s executive committee and represents Broward, Palm Beach and Hendry counties.) We found a similar claim on the Libertarian Party of Broward website that the party is "the third-largest political party in the U.S." We wanted to explore the numbers and the power of the Libertarian Party. Is it the third-largest party in the country? We’ve looked at the numbers of Libertarians in the past. But as Sen. Rand Paul -- a Kentucky Republican with a libertarian outlook -- makes headlines as a potential 2016 presidential contender, it seemed like a good time to revisit the numbers. Counting libertarians Libertarian activists and political scientists we contacted suggested the same source: Richard Winger, a Libertarian in California and editor of a monthly newsletter, Ballot Access News, which includes data on party registration that Winger researches. His December issue showed there were 325,807 registered Libertarians nationwide. (About half the states tally Libertarians, Winger’s data shows.) The number of registered Libertarians was higher than other national third parties including the Green, Constitution or Reform parties. But with Democrats’ registration at 43.5 million and Republicans at 41.3 million according to Winger’s data, that puts any third-place finisher trailing way behind. Also, the number of Libertarians was substantially lower than two catch-all categories which Winger calls "indp. misc" at 26.8 million and "other" at 2.9 million. The miscellaneous category includes states that have a miscellaneous category, as well as voters who write in answers (such as "birthday party") on their registration. Winger’s "other" includes a combination of actual parties. Since those catch-all categories were large, we picked a couple of states to look in more detail at third-party registrations. In California, there were 477,129 registered with the American Independent Party. In New York, there were 430,072 registered with the Independence Party as of November 2012. But Winger said those groups in California and New York aren’t "nationally organized parties. Those are one-state parties." That’s why when Winger talks about Libertarians’ voter registration he includes the phrase "nationally organized" -- something the Libertarians in Broward omitted. We’re not suggesting that those state parties in California or New York are powerful players nationwide -- or even in their own states. Some New York voters wrongly think they are registering as independents, according to the New York Daily News. Markham Robinson, a leader with the American Independent Party, told PolitiFact in an interview that he did a survey of AIP voters and of the 200 who responded, one-third didn’t realize they had registered with a party. Still, Robinson said he’d give that third ranking to his own group based on voter registration. Robinson suggested another way to measure third-party influence: a group’s registration as a percentage of total voters. By that method, he gave a shout-out to the Independent American Party in Nevada -- they garnered almost 5 percent of the state’s registration as of October. Libertarians do have a point when they say they are growing. Ballot Access News showed in 2008 there were 240,328 Libertarians, compared with 325,807 in 2012, an increase of about 36 percent. But their power lies not in electing Libertarians but more in the libertarian philosophy making inroads with the GOP. And some experts told us to examine votes received or the number of candidates who ran as signs of party strength rather than just voter registration. In 2012, Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson received about 1.3 million votes -- more than any other third-party candidate. Johnson's tally, amounting to about 1 percent, is the largest for a non-major-party candidate since Ralph Nader's Green race in 2000, said J. David Gillespie, author of a book on third parties. "Libertarians always run far more people for congressional and state legislative seats across the nation than do the Greens, Constitution Party, or any other third party," he said. Some libertarians choose not to register with the Libertarian Party, either because they don’t like party labels or so they can participate in the nominating contests held by the major parties. Libertarians "do have influence beyond their size, because libertarian ideas appeal to people on both left and right," said Shaun Bowler, a political science professor at the University of California. Our ruling The Libertarian Party in Broward said on its website that the Libertarian Party "is the third-largest political party in the U.S." Quantifying the number of Libertarians is tricky; some states don’t track the affiliation. As for those officially registered with the Libertarian Party, it’s about 326,000. Some state-based parties -- most notably the Independence Party in New York and the American Independent Party in California -- have more people registered to their party than that, though.

pomt-10068	"The Capitol was built by slaves."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jan/19/nancy-pelosi/legend-slaves-building-capitol-correct/	Every now and then, a fact goes viral. Current case in point: that slaves helped construct the U.S. Capitol, where the son of an African man is set to be sworn in as the nation's 44th president. Pundits and politicians have mentioned this dozens of times in the past few days, wielding it as potent shorthand for all the historical import of the moment. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, mentioned it in her remarks at the Dec. 2, 2008, dedication of the Capitol Visitors Center: "The Capitol was built by slaves," Pelosi said. "Today, I want to talk about the fact that it's so appropriate that, though long overdue, this Capitol Visitors Center is ready for 2009, which is the 200th anniversary, the bicentennial of the birth of Abraham Lincoln, the great emancipator." We wanted to find the details behind the assertion and give it more context. It turns out there's far less in the historical record on the subject than one might expect. Early historians of the Capitol's construction were largely indifferent to the work of common laborers, both paid and slave. Records from the time are spotty. Only in the past 15 years or so has attention been trained on the role slaves played in constructing perhaps the nation's most important building — and the work has been led not by professional historians, but by individuals who developed a personal interest in the subject, such as retired Washington television reporter Ed Hotaling and freelance writer Bob Arnebeck. In 2005, Congress appointed a task force to research the subject, which issued a report in conjunction with the Office of the Architect of the Capitol, finally bringing a measure of scholarly rigor to bear on the topic. The task force acknowledged it was not able to tell the full story. "No one will ever know how many slaves helped to build the United States Capitol Building — or the White House," says the 2005 task force report, entitled History of Slave Laborers in the Construction of the United States Capitol. But the task force did find plenty of evidence of slave involvement in the Capitol's construction. Perhaps the most compelling evidence were records of payments from the commissioners for the District of Columbia — the three men appointed by George Washington to oversee the construction of the Capitol and the rest of the city of Washington — to slave owners for the rental of slaves to work on the Capitol. The records reflect 385 payments between 1795 and 1801 for "Negro hire," a euphemism for the yearly rental of slaves. Slaves were likely involved in all aspects of construction, including carpentry, masonry, carting, rafting, plastering, glazing and painting, the task force reported. And slaves appear to have shouldered alone the grueling work of sawing logs and stones. Slave crews also toiled at the marble and sandstone quarries that provided the stone to face the structure — lonely, grueling work with bleak living conditions in rural Virginia and elsewhere. "Keep the yearly hirelings at work from sunrise to sunset — particularly the Negroes," the commissioners wrote to quarry operator William O'Neale in 1794. The commissioners' use of slave labor was unremarkable for the time. When the Capitol was constructed, from 1793 to 1826, the building trades in almost every colony augmented the work force with slave labor. This would have been especially true in the Potomac region — the home of about half the 750,000 African-Americans living in the United States, according to the 1972 book Free Negroes in the District of Columbia, by Letitia Woods Brown. Most of the slaves who worked on the Capitol are known by first name at best — the records refer to a payment of $13.00 to slaveholder Teresa Bent for "Nace," for example, and $23.00 to Elizabeth Brent for "Harry" and "Gabe." But one particular slave, Philip Reid, achieved some renown as an individual. He was a slave laborer for Clark Mills, who was hired to cast the Statue of Freedom, the Capitol's crowning feature. The government paid Reid $1.25 a day for his work. The statue, a draped female figure holding a sheathed sword in one hand and a laurel wreath in the other, stands atop the Capitol dome, 288 feet above the site of Obama's swearing in. Pelosi might have specified that slaves were only part of the work force, but they were involved with almost every aspect of construction for at least the first several years.

pomt-03648	The Dolphins stadium renovation will "create more than 4,000 new local jobs."	half-true	/florida/statements/2013/may/01/friends-miami-first/miami-dolphins-pac-says-stadium-renovation-will-cr/	As Miami-Dade residents begin to vote on whether to help finance a $350 million stadium for the Miami Dolphins, project boosters distributed mailers promising that the project will deliver thousands of new local jobs. One mailer stated: "The plan will not only create more than 4,000 new local jobs, it is critical for attracting more sporting and entertainment events to a world class Miami facility which increases tourism, supports local businesses and pumps hundreds of millions of dollars into our community." The mailer was paid for by the stadium’s political action committee, Friends of Miami First, which has raised $1 million since April 1. The contributions came from the Dolphins and South Florida Stadium LLC, team owner Stephen Ross’ company. The 4,000 jobs figure has been repeated multiple times in recent months as the Dolphins sought financing from the state and county. A separate mailer states "support over 4,000 new jobs for Miami-Dade" and shows a photo of a construction worker. Here we are fact-checking the mailer’s claim that the renovation of the Sun Life stadium will "create more than 4,000 new local jobs." (Read our related Dolphins stadium fact-checks here and here.) Goal includes local hires The job creation figure is a selling point for the Dolphins, as they work at record speed to convince state legislators who conclude their session May 3 to sign off on a plan for $90 million in sales tax rebates and to allow an increase in the mainland Miami bed tax to generate about $289 million. The mailer omits those amounts, but it does state that the team would repay the state and county about $159 million. If the Legislature and Gov. Rick Scott give the go-ahead, Miami-Dade voters will be asked if they want to designate annual tourist room taxes for the project in a May 14 referendum. (Early and absentee voting started April 29.) The agreement requires private funding, which is expected to come from the Dolphins and the NFL to pay for more than half the project. By May 22, the NFL will decide whether to award the 50th Super Bowl in 2016 to Miami or San Francisco. The team’s agreement with the county says that the team will "aspire" to hire at least 70 percent of the workers from Miami-Dade with 10 percent from Miami Gardens -- the city where the stadium is located -- and at least 20 percent from low-income areas. The team will also "aspire" to hire at least 35 percent of the subcontractors from Miami-Dade. There is no financial penalty if the team doesn’t meet those local hiring goals and there is no goal or requirement regarding the sheer number of jobs, county spokeswoman Suzy Trutie said. Study used to come up with job figures The mailer didn’t provide details about its numbers, so we asked Dolphins spokesman Eric Jotkoff to elaborate. Jotkoff allowed a PolitiFact Florida reporter and a Miami Herald business reporter to review -- but not retain -- a copy of a study paid for by the Dolphins that the team used to arrive at that figure. The study, prepared by the Washington Economics Group in 2010, was about a possible $225 million stadium renovation which assumed some hotel bed tax participation by Broward County, so it includes job projections for Miami-Dade and Broward combined. It concluded the project would produce 3,740 jobs, which assumes at least one year of employment per person. That includes 1,550 direct jobs and the remainder are indirect jobs in related industries and induced jobs generated by the economic activity. The jobs included 39 percent in the "knowledge based sector," which includes information technology, finance, real estate and other areas; 34 percent construction; and the remainder were government related or "other." But the Dolphins have not produced a study of the current project to show it will create more than 4,000 local jobs. Instead, the team is using cocktail napkin estimates here: If a $225 million project would create 3,740 jobs, then a $350 million project would create at least 4,000, they say. "It’s a conservative estimate of jobs that this will create," Jotkoff said. These 4,000 jobs are associated with the 25-month construction project. Jotkoff said some of the jobs will continue beyond the 25 months but he had no details as to how many. The same firm did a separate study in 2013 that concluded there are 14,503 permanent current jobs at the Sun Life Stadium, mostly with the Dolphins. That study was prepared for the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce, which endorsed the stadium proposal, and a related entity the South Florida Progress Foundation. Experts weigh in on jobs claim We sent the Dolphins’ jobs claim and a summary of the 2010 study to multiple economists, including some who specialize in the business of sports. They raised several caveats about the job growth figures. First, these aren’t permanent jobs. (Jotkoff said some jobs would extend beyond 25 months, but he had no details as to how many.) These are "4,000 jobs we are talking about during the construction phase," said University of Florida economics professor Roger Blair, who teaches a class on the business of sports. "Why is that something get excited about? (These are) jobs that people will have for a couple of years and then they will disappear." And, those jobs aren’t coming here for free -- the public is paying for them through the hotel bed tax and the state sales tax. Economists say that you have to factor in the spending that won’t happen elsewhere in the state, due to the public money earmarked for this particular project. The majority of sales taxes go into the state’s general fund, which pays for law enforcement, education, environmental programs and other areas. The bed tax would be an increase, so the Dolphins can argue that’s new money and wouldn’t be spent elsewhere, since it is being created for them. Tourist taxes can only be spent on certain uses such as stadiums, convention centers and museums. "The problem is that these jobs have to be financed," said Smith College economics professor Andrew Zimbalist. "Would it create jobs if the county hired 1,000 workers to dig a big hole and then a 1,000 more to fill it up? If so, then no city would ever have any unemployment." (Zimbalist is a consultant for Major League Baseball but told PolitiFact he does not consult for the NFL.) The jobs wouldn’t be significant for the county, economists told PolitiFact. "I certainly don’t want to disparage any job creation figures, as those are real jobs for real people, but payroll employment in Miami-Dade County is over 1 million, so this wouldn’t be an economic game changer," said Chris Lafakis, senior economist at Moody’s who analyzes Florida’s economy. "The best way to judge the economic merits of this project are how will this project be paid for and how else would that funding be spent? These are very important questions in order to determine the net benefit to the Miami Dade economy." Also, one expert pointed out that the study was paid for by team, so that’s not an independent analysis. "The organizations that often provide these economic impact studies have something to gain or have a vested interest," said Robert Baade, a professor who specializes in the economics of sports at Lake Forest College. "Certainly if the team commissioned the study that would be true ... They are going to put the project’s best foot forward ... They realize there is a skeptical and reluctant public and they’ve got to make the project look good. That doesn’t make them evil -- it does mean they are erring on side of optimism rather than taking a more conservative approach." Our ruling The mailer distributed by Miami First said that the Dolphins stadium renovation will "create more than 4,000 new local jobs." The Dolphins based the number on a 2010 study of a $225 million project that concluded 3,740 jobs in Miami-Dade and Broward. They haven’t shown any study of the current project to support their claim that it will create more than 4,000 local jobs. Instead, they tacked on an extra 260 jobs to the new $350 million project and say that’s conservative. The key omission here is that these are jobs associated with the 25-month stadium renovation project and include temporary positions. The Dolphins say that some jobs would continue, but they have provided no details as to how many of those 4,000 jobs would extend beyond the construction phase. To get those jobs, the team would receive $379 million from the state and county over about three decades, and eventually pay back about $159 million. As to whether the jobs will be local, the team has set a goal to hire the vast majority of the workers from Miami-Dade County but there is no financial penalty if they fail to do so.

pomt-05410	"Over the history of Austin, it’s always gotten more expensive."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2012/may/03/mike-martinez/mike-martinez-says-austin-has-always-grown-more-ex/	In an interview aired April 19, 2012, Austin City Council Member Mike Martinez was asked by Matt Largey of Austin’s KUT, 90.5 FM whether the council could do more to make Austin affordable. Yes, Martinez replied, adding a beat later: "Over the history of Austin, it’s always gotten more expensive. And that’s not going to change." Martinez continued: "What we do as a council is to try to manage that economic growth to where it doesn’t negatively impact our residents as much as it could. If we didn’t involve ourselves, if we didn’t insert ourselves, I dare say it would be a whole lot worse." Setting aside the council’s role and impact, has Austin always gotten more expensive? Of course, Martinez told us in a telephone interview. Saying he’s been an Austin resident since 1988, Martinez said that gas prices, property values, property taxes and utility costs have all gone up. He added: "I don’t think you need to do a study. You’re not paying the same price for a gallon of milk that you paid 20 years ago." (Wise-guy response: You are if you don’t drink milk.) "Always" is a powerful characterization; Austin was established in 1839. And Martinez did not provide, nor did we find, information specifically showing Austin growing more expensive every year through history. Seeking the long view, we queried David C. Humphrey, who wrote the entry for Austin in the Handbook of Texas Online. He replied by email: "Over the years, Austin's economy has had its downs as well as its ups. In the latter 1980s, for example, starting in 1986, housing prices tumbled and Austin's office vacancy rate jumped to No. 1 in the nation... Austin's economy took a few years to recover but was sizzling again by the mid-1990s. The early 1930s, during the Great Depression, were certainly hard economic times for many Austinites. Wages and salaries fell (UT faculty members took a 25 percent pay cut), and unemployment grew acute, though Austin's economy held up better than that of many other towns and cities." Humphrey, summing up, said Austin prices haven’t always been on the rise, though prices have trended upward in recent years. We’ve poked into Austin’s affordability before, rating Mostly False a 2011 claim that Austin had lately experienced the highest cost of living of any large Texas city. At the time, we considered a composite cost-of-living index managed by the Virginia-based Council for Community and Economic Research. The council’s index is based on the costs of housing, utilities, grocery items, transportation, health care and miscellaneous goods and services, but it does not weigh the effect of property taxes, which is substantial in Texas. The index enables comparisons of the cost of living between cities at any given time but does not lend itself to gauging changes in a city over time, council spokesman Dean Frutiger recently told us. Frutiger forwarded Austin’s index for the first quarter of 1991 through 2011. In eight of those years, the index suggests, Austin’s cost of living was lower than the national average. In the first quarter of 1994, 1997 and 2004, Austin’s cost of living exceeded the national average. Mindful that Martinez spoke about Austin’s cost of living in itself, we turned next to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which tracks the Consumer Price Index, the government measure of the average change over time in the prices of consumer items — goods and services that people buy for day-to-day living. James Howard, a Dallas-based bureau economist, told us by telephone that Austin is not among southern cities where prices are routinely checked by field staff. However, the bureau’s index research for some metropolitan areas of 150,000 to 1.5 million in population since 2002 included checks of prices in San Antonio, Beaumont-Port Arthur, Brownsville-Harlingen-San Benito, Amarillo and Midland-Odessa. And according to that research, the CPI-U -- that is, the index for urban consumers -- went up nearly every year from 2002 to 2012, with the bumps ranging from 1.1 percent, in 2002, to 4.7 percent, in 2008. The index dropped slightly in one year, 2009, by 0.4 percent. It then increased 1.8 percent in 2010. Howard pointed out older bureau research for similar cities indicating that the CPI-U escalated every year from 1977 through 1997. Other experts pointed out other ways of gauging changes in Austin’s cost of living. Beverly Kerr, vice president for research at the Greater Austin Area Chamber of Commerce, applied a version of the CPI-U to average home prices as calculated by the Real Estate Center at Texas A&M University. Based on 2011 dollars, Austin’s average 2011 home price of $251,600 was higher, by about $100,000, than Austin’s average 1990 home price of $149,762. Again calculated in 2011 dollars, the average home price dropped in six of the 21 years between 1990 and 2012, Kerr’s calculation suggests — in 2001, 2003, 2004, 2008, 2009 and 2011. The biggest drop was $13,095 from 2007 to 2008, when the average home price was $253,787. Wondering about apartment rents, we checked with Dallas-based Laura Williams of ALN Apartment Data Inc. who guided us to its graph indicating that rents paid by Austin residents steadily climbed from late 2005 to early 2008, then dropped off to 2010 before mostly increasing to 2012. Separately, Kerr guided us to Hendricks & Partners, whose Austin spokesman, George Deuillet, told us average rents in Austin increased all but one year from 2006 through 2011, dropping 3.5 percent in 2009. A little more: Robin Davis of Austin Investor Interests, which has a website tracking apartment trends, told us that local apartment rents dropped from 2001 to 2004 before gradually climbing through 2008, dipping in 2009 and subsequently climbing. We recognized one more aspect to gauging how expensive Austin has been during a telephone interview of Bruce Kellison, associate director of the University of Texas Bureau of Business Research, IC² (Innovation, Creativity, Capital) Institute. Kellison counseled that any analysis of changes in the cost of living should try to account for wage changes. It’s possible, he said, that while prices increased, wages outpaced them. We asked Austin economist Stuart Greenfield to assess how average wages have tracked with the cost of living. Greenfield, drawing on information from state and federal agencies, said unadjusted annual pay in Travis County, which includes Austin, increased about 24 percent from 2001 through 2010, narrowly outpacing inflation which ranged from 23 to nearly 24 percent, according to different versions of the CPI. Put another way, he said, real annual pay increased about 1 percent -- a smidge. And does this suggest that life in Austin grew a little less expensive? On average, Greenfield replied, "one’s well-being improved" slightly. Nudged before we finished this research, an Austin consultant to Martinez, Mark Littlefield, pointed out that by the calculations of the the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, the CPI was far greater in 2012 than it would have been at Austin’s founding. "There have been years of nominal decreases, like during the Great Depression, but over time things have obviously ‘gotten more expensive’ in Austin," Littlefield said by email. According to the bank’s calculation, though, the CPI stayed the same or decreased in about 70 of the years from 1840 through 1955. After that, it dropped in one year, 2009, by 0.4 percent. Our ruling In some ways, Austin has grown more expensive of late. Yet rents dipped in some years. And the area’s average annual pay outpaced inflation over a recent decade. Also, while we did not come up with precise pre-1990s information, it's reasonable to speculate that periods of economic difficulty through history included decreases in Austin's cost of living. This claim has a nowadays’ ring of truth, but its "always" element disregards times when costs dropped. We rate Martinez’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-10280	"The fact is that although we have had a president who is opposed to abortion over the last eight years, abortions have not gone down.''	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/21/barack-obama/abortion-numbers-have-gone-down/	In his Aug. 16, 2008, appearance with megachurch pastor Rick Warren, Sen. Barack Obama asserted that "abortions have not gone down'' in the United States during the presidency of George W. Bush, a strong abortion opponent. "I believe in Roe vs. Wade , and I come to that conclusion not because I'm proabortion, but because, ultimately, I don't think women make these decisions casually. I think they — they wrestle with these things in profound ways, in consultation with their pastors or their spouses or their doctors or their family members," Obama said. "And so, for me, the goal right now should be — and this is where I think we can find common ground. And by the way, I've now inserted this into the Democratic Party platform, is how do we reduce the number of abortions? The fact is that although we have had a president who is opposed to abortion over the last eight years, abortions have not gone down and that is something we have to address." But Obama's statement is directly contradicted by statistics that show legal abortions have fallen since the start of the 21st century. The New York-based Guttmacher Institute reported in January 2008 that in 2005 the country's abortion rate fell to 19.4 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15 to 44, continuing a trend that started after the abortion rate peaked in 1981 at 29.3. The institute, a think tank on reproductive health issues, reported that the number of abortions also fell, to 1.2-million in 2005, which it said was 25 percent below the record high of 1.6-million abortions in 1990. And the federal Centers for Disease Control reported in its latest Abortion Surveillance Report that in 2004 there were 839,226 legal abortions, down 1.1 percent from 2003. The abortion ratio of 16 per 1,000 women has been the same since 2000, it added. Rebecca Wind, spokesman of the Guttmacher Institute, said the difference in the two sets of numbers reflects differences in data collection. She said the CDC relies on state health departments, and not all states require abortion statistics reporting. Guttmacher does its own survey of all legal abortion providers and reports a fairly high response rate. In any case, she added, "There's no way to spin this one. The abortion rate is at its lowest rate since 1974.'' Obama made his comments to Warren in the context of cutting the number of abortions. He said he wanted to find "ways that we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies, so that we actually are reducing the sense that women are seeking out abortions.'' In that context, his comment about abortions made sense. Guttmacher data showed that 49 percent of pregnancies were unintended in 2001, unchanged from 1994. Obama's campaign did not respond to an e-mail seeking an explanation for the senator's statement. But his comment about the abortion rate was wrong, so we rule this claim False.

pomt-07447	"Seniors will have to find $12,500 for health care because Republicans voted to end Medicare."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/20/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/democrats-say-republicans-voted-end-medicare-and-c/	A new political ad from Democrats shows seniors running a lemonade stand, cutting the grass, and even stripping at a bachelorette party -- all to raise money to pay for Medicare. The stripper, dressed as a firefighter, bellows, "Did someone call the fire department? Because it's about to get HOT in here!" The young women throw money at him while he dances around with a pink feather boa. (See the ad here.) "Seniors will have to find $12,500 for health care," the ad says, "because Republicans voted to end Medicare." So do grandparents have to go back to work because of a Republican vote? Not really. The Republican proposal explained The ad critiques a budget proposal from Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., chairman of the House Budget Committee. Ryan’s plan would dramatically cut federal spending in the name of fiscal discipline, and it has widespread support in the Republican caucus. One of the its major features is dramatically restructuring Medicare, the government-run health insurance program for those 65 and older. Right now, Medicare pays doctors and hospitals set fees for the care beneficiaries receive. Medicare beneficiaries contribute premiums for some types of coverage, and younger workers contribute payroll taxes. Ryan’s plan leaves Medicare as is for people 55 and older. In 2022, though, new beneficiaries would receive "premium support," which means they would buy plans from private insurance companies with financial assistance from the government. People who need more health care would get a little more money. Some call this a voucher program, but the proposal says it’s not a voucher plan, because the government would pay the insurance companies directly. The proposal requires private insurers to accept all applicants and to charge the same rate for people who are the same age. The plans would comply with standards to be set by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which administers the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. The plan gradually raises the Medicare eligibility age to 67, and it provides smaller premium support to high earners. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analyzed Ryan’s proposal and found that it will save the government money. But it does so by asking future Medicare beneficiaries to pay more for insurance. "A private health insurance plan covering the standardized benefit would, CBO estimates, be more expensive currently than traditional Medicare. Both administrative costs (including profits) and payment rates to providers are higher for private plans than for Medicare," the CBO concluded. Ryan says the plan would offer more choice for Medicare participants and increase competition among private insurers to drive down cost. What the ad gets wrong Yes, the Republican plan would be a huge change to the current program, and seniors would have to pay more for their health plans if it becomes law. Democrats, including President Barack Obama, have said they are strongly opposed to the plan. But to say the Republicans voted to end Medicare, as the ad does, is a major exaggeration. All seniors would continue to be offered coverage under the proposal, and the program’s budget would increase every year. Republicans say that future spending projections for Medicare are not sustainable, and the program requires changes. Their proposal "protects and preserves Medicare -- with no disruptions -- for those in and near retirement and provides those now under the age of 55 with a strengthened, personalized Medicare program they can count on when they retire," said Conor Sweeney, a spokesperson for House Budget Committee. Democrats, though, contend that the proposal would change the essential nature of Medicare as a guarantee of health coverage for seniors. The Congressional Budget Office released a detailed analysis of the proposal, and concluded that future beneficiaries would pay more for current levels of coverage, and that some will decide to go without any insurance. The Republican proposal will end the aspect of Medicare that directly covers specific services, such as hospital coverage. "It's as if you took the Office of Faith-Based Partnerships and ended the faith-based portion of it, but continued to call it faith-based," said Jesse Ferguson of the DCCC. "There is no doubt that Medicare -- a health insurance program for seniors -- would end under the House Republican plan and, according to the independent Congressional Budget Office, health insurance costs would rise for seniors." Democrats, including Obama, have said the plan would end Medicare "as we know it," a critical qualifier. But the 30-second ad from the DCCC makes a sweeping claim without that important qualifier . Another problem with the ad is that it claims that participants would have to find $12,500 to pay for Medicare. That number is based on statistics compiled by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The ad doesn’t mention, though, that the number includes money that would go to Medicare in any case. The CBO estimates beneficiaries would contribute about $6,150 in premiums in 2022 if the program isn’t changed at all. So the extra money seniors need to pay under the Republican proposal is more like $6,350. Still another problem with the ad involves who’s immediately affected by the Republican proposal. In one scene, the ad shows a senior citizen pushing a walker behind a lawn mower. A teenager looking on eats an apple and says, "You missed a spot." In reality, people 55 and older won’t see changes under the Ryan plan. It’s actually that teenager -- or anyone else 54 or younger -- who would pay extra money when they are older. And finally, the ad neglects another critical fact: The Republicans voted on a budget resolution that states policy preferences, but the vote did not actually change Medicare, much less end it. As we’ve noted before in previous fact-checks, budget resolutions are non-binding documents that cannot be viewed as the equivalent of legislation that establishes law. Deeply desiring something and accomplishing it are different. We ran this by Richard Kaplan, an elder law expert at the University of Illinois, who agreed the Republicans have not voted to end Medicare. "Nobody voted to end it," he said. "They voted to hopefully change it one day, when they get a chance, but they would need a Republican-dominated Senate and a Republican president, neither of which they have." "It’s not as if this is of no consequence. But it doesn’t change Medicare," he said. Our ruling Both Republicans and Democrats would no doubt agree that Ryan’s plan for Medicare is a dramatic change of course. But we don’t agree with the ad’s contention that the proposal ends Medicare. Additionally, images in the ad imply that current seniors will have to go back to work to pay for changes to the program. That’s not true either. It’s actually those 54 and younger who will need extra money. With its scenes of seniors going back to work, it seems intended to frighten those who are currently enrolled in Medicare. Finally, the Republicans' vote was symbolic and didn’t actually change the program. When you add up all those distortions, we find the ad highly misleading. The ad’s aged firefighter says, "Did someone call the fire department? Because it's about to get HOT in here!" We agree. Pants on Fire!

pomt-00859	The delay in school testing "was not that of a vendor, the problem was not that of the test materials itself, it was the product of a cyber attack."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2015/mar/16/h-marlene-otoole/house-education-chair-blames-florida-testing-delay/	On day 1 of the new computerized standardized tests in Florida, students and administrators across the state couldn’t log on to the tests, forcing some districts to postpone the assessments. The problems that started March 2 spanned the state and hit Florida's largest counties including Miami-Dade, Broward and Hillsborough. Initial reports were that it was a technical glitch in the hands of the testing vendor, American Institutes for Research. But by the end of the week, state law enforcement were also investigating a cyber security attack. Miami-Dade Superintendent Alberto Carvalho would later call it a "catastrophic meltdown," and the testing problems added more fuel to the fire about Florida’s focus on tests. During a House Education Appropriations Committee meeting March 12, chairwoman and state Rep. H. Marlene O'Toole, R-Lady Lake, put the blame solely on the cyber attack. "On the testing problems, many of you may have read in the media, that the problem was not that of a vendor, the problem was not that of the test materials itself, it was the product of a cyber attack," she said. O’Toole’s claim suggested that the sole problem was the cyber attack, but that conflicted with news reports and information provided by the state Department of Education. The testing woes Whether K-12 students are taking too many tests is a hot topic during this legislative session, with many teachers and parents pushing for fewer tests. Gov. Rick Scott promised during his 2014 campaign to investigate every statewide test and in February ordered the state to stop giving an 11th-grade Florida Standards Assessment for language arts. This year, students started taking the Florida Standards Assessments aligned to Florida's new education benchmarks, based on the Common Core State Standards. The new tests replaced the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Tests. Testing started on Monday, March 2 -- and was an instant mess. The problems occurred on the computer-based tests given in grades 8-10 when they couldn’t log on to the testing platform. The Tampa Bay Times reported that testing problems occurred in more than half of the districts. The state sent districts an email Tuesday morning saying that the testing vendor, AIR, had fixed software problems the day before. But the problems persisted in some places. "What happened was AIR did an update to their system the day before testing began," Stewart explained to a House education committee March 5. "Admittedly that was the wrong timing, and it caused them some issues with data retrieval." AIR issued a statement to the media, including PolitiFact Florida, accepting "full responsibility" for the technical difficulties. "Ultimately, we concluded that an update we performed had inadvertently degraded system performance, resulting in the delays districts experienced. Once we were able to identify the problem, we promptly resolved it," a spokesman wrote. But on March 9 -- one week after the testing troubles began -- Stewart sent a press release stating that the Florida Department of Law Enforcement was investigating testing delays caused by cyber-attacks on a server used to administer the test. Stewart wrote that "some of the delays in testing" were due to cyber-attacks and repeated that AIR’s system update had resulted in the initial delays Monday and Tuesday. "By Tuesday afternoon, the issue with the log on server was resolved," Stewart wrote. "While there were some sporadic reports of denial of service on Monday and Tuesday, significant concerns of an attack did not occur until Thursday morning when DOE received widespread reports from a number of districts of ‘white screens’ after logging in. By approximately 8:30 a.m. Thursday, the problem had subsided and the districts that continued were able to test successfully for the rest of the day. AIR confirmed the cause of this issue was a cyber-attack on the log on server." AIR told PolitiFact Florida that the cyber-attack was launched against a firewall that protects the servers. "There was no attempt to infiltrate the firewall, but rather to make the website unavailable by flooding the firewall with nonsense connections," an AIR spokesman said. School districts have a two-week window to deliver the tests, and as of the middle of the second week, about 87 percent of the students had taken the tests. We sent portions of Stewart’s press release to O’Toole spokesman Joshua Blake, who said she misspoke during the committee. "I intended to convey that a cyber-attack was reported to have played a role in those initial difficulties, but the numbers show that 87 percent have completed the test as of yesterday, and I am encouraged by that number," O'Toole said in a statement provided by Blake. Our ruling O’Toole said that the testing "problem was not that of a vendor, the problem was not that of the test materials itself, it was the product of a cyber attack." Actually, a vendor update was responsible for the initial problems that kept students from logging onto the new testing system. The cyber attack was another problem that happened later in the week. O’Toole admitted she misspoke. There is an element of truth here because the cyber attack did create problems, but it wasn’t the only culprit. We rate this claim Mostly False.	None	H.

pomt-05958	Says Wisconsin Democrats during the previous administration adopted "double-digit tax increases."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jan/25/scott-walker/fighting-recall-wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-says-do/	In his latest TV ad, released on the first anniversary of his inauguration, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker makes a case for why he should not be only the third U.S. governor ever recalled from office. The Republican takes credit for erasing Wisconsin’s $3.6 billion budget deficit and for saving taxpayers "hundreds of millions of dollars" by making government employees pay more for pension and health benefits. Walker closes the ad, released Jan. 3, 2012, by drawing a contrast with his Democratic predecessor. "In the three years before I took office," he says, without naming Jim Doyle, "Wisconsin lost 150,000 jobs. But now, well, employer confidence is up, and since the start of the year, Wisconsin has added thousands of new jobs. Instead of going back to the days of billion-dollar budget deficits, double-digit tax increases and record job loss, let’s keep moving Wisconsin forward." That’s some broad language. So broad, some would think the double-digit increases were a fact of life for most residents. While widespread jobs losses in the recession and the deficit Walker inherited are well known, we wondered what Walker meant by "double-digit tax increases." Walker repeated the "double-digit tax increases" claim on Rush Limbaugh’s national radio talk show on Jan. 17, 2012, the day before petitions seeking the recall election were submitted. And he did it again the next day, claiming Democratic recall candidate Kathleen Falk intends to "take Wisconsin back to the days" of double-digit tax increases. Let’s see if that’s what state Democrats did. Democrats did boost taxes with the 2009-2011 state budget and a 2009 budget adjustment bill. We found, when rating a $5 billion claim by Walker running mate Rebecca Kleefisch as False, that the two measures raised taxes and fees by just over $3 billion over the two-year period. Ben Sparks, a spokesman for the Republican Party of Wisconsin, said Walker’s double-digit claim refers to the same two budget measures. In a document Sparks provided, Walker cites three sets of tax changes to back his claim. School property taxes Walker said that, because of the Democrats’ 2009-2011 budget, school property tax levies would have increased an estimated 17.3 percent in 2011 had he not taken the steps he did with his 2011-2013 budget. Hmmm. In the ad, Walker flatly claimed that Democrats raised taxes by double-digits. Now he’s talking about a hypothetical -- indeed, one that didn’t occur. Like any governor, Walker had the opportunity to fashion his own budget. And with a Republican-controlled Legislature, he cut state aid to schools and school districts’ ability to raise property tax revenues. The result: 2011 school levies dropped 1 percent. What about the other two tax changes Walker cites? Business taxes Walker contends Democrats raised business taxes by $456 million, or 28 percent, over two years. Among other things, he cited the Democratic adoption of "combined reporting," which taxes a relatively small number of Wisconsin-based businesses on income from subsidiaries outside the state, rather than only those within Wisconsin. That tax is estimated to raise $187 million over two years. He also cited elimination of a tax deduction for domestic production, which is estimated to increase corporate income tax payments by nearly $72 million. Dale Knapp, research director of the nonprofit Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, said there isn’t a good base on which to calculate the $450 million increase. But roughly $350 million of that increase is to be paid in corporate income taxes, which is roughly an increase of 21 percent, he said. So, that material is generally on point. What’s left? Miscellaneous taxes Walker cites a number of double-digit tax increases the Democrats made, including a 42 percent hike in the tax on cigarettes to $2.52 per pack; more than doubling the $75 per-bed per-month assessment paid by nursing homes; and more than doubling the "tipping fee" charged to landfills, which is ultimately passed on to garbage generators such as families. Our own research turned up one Walker didn’t cite. The Democrats raised the top income tax rate from 6.75 percent to 7.75 percent. That 1-percentage-point increase amounts to a 15 percent boost in the rate itself. The change caused a 13.5 percent increase in the actual tax paid by people with an adjusted gross income of $1 million or more, according to the taxpayers alliance. Our rating In a TV ad, Walker said the Democratic administration and Legislature that preceded him approved "double-digit tax increases." There certainly were not widespread double-digit increases in the taxes most people directly pay -- income taxes and the sales tax. But there are a variety of other tax increases that rose by double digits. We rate Walker’s statement Mostly True.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2012-01-25T09:00:00	2012-01-03	['None']
pomt-08545	"The Republican candidate [John Loughlin] has talked about privatizing Social Security ... so we know where he stands on the issue."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2010/oct/02/david-cicilline/cicilline-says-loughlin-has-talked-about-privatizi/	It may be the most frequently used weapon in the Democratic arsenal this midterm election season: accusing the GOP of wanting to "privatize" Social Security. So many Democrats have made such claims about their Republican opponents that our national PolitiFact team and those in other states have reviewed the issue on more than a half-dozen occasions. Most found that the Democrats have distorted the Republican position to some degree, with the claims receiving Half True or Barely True ratings. Here in Rhode Island, the topic takes on particular significance because we have one of the highest percentages in the country of people 65 and older, more than 14 percent. Nearly 140,000 Rhode Island seniors receive Social Security benefits. Democratic congressional candidate David Cicilline has joined the chorus of critics in his new "Fighting For Social Security" campaign tour, suggesting to seniors that his GOP opponent, state Rep. John Loughlin, would gamble with their money. At his first stop, on Sept. 23, he told a group of elderly voters at Pawtucket's St. Germain Manor Senior Center: "The Republican candidate has talked about privatizing Social Security, and when there was a resolution [in the Rhode Island General Assembly] urging Congress not to privatize Social Security, he was one of seven people to vote no on that. So we know where he stands on that issue." Speaking quite literally, it's true that Loughlin has talked about the concept of privatization. It would be hard to be a Republican -- or a Democrat -- running for federal office and not address whether that's a good or bad idea. And Loughlin acknowledges his 2005 vote against a Rhode Island House resolution pressing Congress not to privatize the program. Why did he vote that way? He says he didn't think it made sense to completely block the concept. Moving on to the next part of his claim, we asked Cicilline for examples of where Loughlin "stands on the issue" of privatization. His campaign provided us with several. The first was in a quote from Loughlin in The Providence Journal in February. "I think that citizens should be able to choose to put a portion of their Social Security payroll taxes into private investment accounts, but it should be completely voluntary. Recent stock market volatility is going to cause some people to want to stay within the current system and that's fine," Loughlin told a reporter. A second, similar reference came two days after the September primary when Loughlin told The Pawtucket Times that "younger workers should be allowed to privatize some of their Social Security" to give them greater flexibility. Like our PolitiFact counterparts in other states, we question whether Loughlin's suggestion that workers be allowed to voluntarily divert a portion of their payroll to a personal investment account constitutes a desire to privatize. What we found was that this issue is very much a war of words. Loughlin believes the option to investment in a personal account is simply that, an option. Cicilline counters that voluntary changes are no different than full privatization because they would eat away at the Social Security funding stream, destabilizing the program and taking it one step closer to elimination. "I don't think we're claiming he wants to abolish Social Security, but this isn't us putting words in his mouth," Cicilline campaign manager Eric Hyers told us. "He used the 'P' word." Loughlin dismissed the idea that voluntary accounts and full privatization are comparable -- or that Cicilline knows where he stands on the issue -- calling his opponent's comments "completely and totally false." Though Loughlin does support the concept of allowing people to make choices about parts of their contribution money "That is not the same by any stretch of the imagination as privatizing Social Security," he argues. "Not even close." Privatization, Loughlin believes, implies a mandated change, something he says he opposes. "This is a very common line of attack on the Democratic attack wheel ... " Loughlin continued. "The playbook tells them, go to all senior centers and the nursing homes and say the Republican candidate wants to take away your Social Security and kick you off and they want to put it in that risky thing down on Wall Street called the stock market." At the same time, the Republican is sharply critical of the current Social Security system, on several occasions even comparing it to a Ponzi scheme. PolitiFact Rhode Island will examine that comment in a separate item Sunday. But let's get back to the privatization question. Taking it point by point, Cicilline is correct when he says Loughlin has talked about privatization. It's important to note however that words matter. Had Cicilline made a more stringent accusation, we might have judged it differently. He's also right that Loughlin voted against the resolution urging Washington to oppose it. On the third point, however, Cicilline misses the mark. He does not appear to know where his opponent stands on the issue. Loughlin himself says Cicilline is flat out misinterpreting his position. Yet that hasn't stopped Cicilline from criss-crossing the state using the accusation to scare elderly voters and win votes. Yes, Loughlin has expressed dissatisfaction with the current program and has publicly supported tinkering with the system to offer a private option. But to our knowledge, the GOP candidate has never advocated for making the program fully private. And he says he has no plans to do so. We rate Cicilline's claim Half True.

pomt-08141	"The senior senator from Arizona (John McCain) said he couldn't support repealing 'don't ask, don't tell' because of the economy."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/dec/06/harry-reid/sen-harry-reid-says-sen-john-mccain-opposes-dont-a/	In an address from the floor of the Senate on Dec. 4, 2010, Democratic Sen. Harry Reid used the analogy of Lucy from the Peanuts cartoon -- who repeatedly pulled the football away every time Charlie Brown went to kick it -- to describe Sen. John McCain's reasoning for his opposition to abolishing the military's controversial "don't ask, don't tell" policy. "First, Sen. McCain said he would seriously consider repealing it if the military leadership thought we should, and (when) the military leadership said it should be repealed, he pulled away the football. Then Sen. McCain said he would need to see a study from the Pentagon. When the Pentagon produced the study saying repeal would have no negative effect at all, he pulled away the football again," Reid said. "And his latest trick, he said yesterday that he opposed repealing 'don't ask, don't tell,' a proposal that would be a great stride forward for both equality and military readiness ... because of the economy," said Reid, whose quote was picked up in Politico. "I repeat, the senior senator from Arizona said he couldn't support repealing 'don't ask, don't tell' because of the economy." "I have no idea what he's talking about, and no one else does either," Reid said. Reid's statement -- based on comments McCain made the day before during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on the Defense Department's report about the "don't ask, don't tell" policy -- seemed to suggest that McCain believed "don't ask, don't tell" had some sort of negative economic consequences. But that's not the context for McCain's comments. Rather, it was an issue of legislative priority. McCain's point was that the issue of how to address a flailing economy ought to be addressed before the Senate considered something like "don't ask, don't tell." "I will not agree to have this bill go forward ... because our economy is in the tank," McCain said. "Our economy is in the tank, and the American people want that issue addressed. And the military is functioning in the most efficient, most professional, most courageous fashion than at any time in our history. "So to somehow believe that this is some kind of compelling issue at a time we're in two wars ... is obviously not something that we should be exercising a rush to judgment." Two days earlier the entire Republican caucus in the Senate signed a letter, sent to Reid, promising to filibuster any bills proposed by Democrats until the Senate had acted to prevent the expiration of the Bush tax cuts for all taxpayers. Republicans have argued that letting the tax cuts expire even for the wealthy, as Democrats proposed, would deal a devastating blow to the economy. McCain's comments about not taking up "don't ask don't tell" in light of the economy are consistent with that Republican pledge. McCain added that he would be willing to consider the "don't ask, don't tell" issue in depth during the next legislative session. "I would be more than eager in the coming year to have additional hearings, as they had some 13 hearings when 'don't, ask, don't tell' was enacted," McCain said. "And I would pledge to work with you on that effort, but certainly not during a lame-duck session when parts of my state are suffering in ways that they never have in the history of my state." It's true that McCain listed the poor economy as a reason he would not support "don't ask, don't tell," but only in the context of the economy needing to be a higher priority for the Senate. When Reid claimed, "the senior senator from Arizona said he couldn't support repealing 'don't ask, don't tell' because of the economy," the implication seems to be that McCain was making an argument that "don't ask, don't tell" would harm the economy. Especially when Reid added, "I have no idea what he's talking about, and no one else does either." The policy's impact on the economy would be a confusing argument. But in context, McCain's reference to the economy was quite clearly ranking other priorities against it. We rule Reid's statement Half True.

pomt-12362	"Property taxes are lower right now than they were" in December 2010 on a median-valued home in Wisconsin.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/jun/07/scott-walker/property-taxes-lower-typical-wisconsin-home-under-/	For a while there, Gov. Scott Walker was coy about whether he would run for a third four-year term in 2018. But now his intentions are all but official, and he is repeatedly sounding themes that could show up as part of his campaign platform. On May 18, 2017, Walker was interviewed by Jeff Wagner, a conservative talk show host on WTMJ-AM in Milwaukee. Wagner opened by asking about one of the governor’s favorite topics: property tax reform. Walker responded by declaring that property taxes on a median-value home "are lower right now than they were" in December 2010, the month before he took office. He’s correct, though there’s a caveat. Prior fact checks There’s no question property taxes, though they might increase for some individual property owners and decrease for others, have generally been on the decline since Walker took office and his fellow Republicans took control of the Legislature in 2011. In 2015, we rated Mostly True a Walker claim that because of his actions, property taxes were lower than they were four years earlier. Walker’s actions to limit the ability of local governments and school districts to raise levies played a major role. But the lower property taxes to that point were also due in part to declines in housing values. In January 2017, when Walker said that property taxes -- as a percentage of personal income -- were "the lowest that they've been since the end of World War II," our rating was True. An analysis by the nonpartisan Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance showed that on the measure Walker cited, they were lowest since 1946. And on our Walk-O-Meter, which tracks Walker’s campaign promises, we’ve rated In the Works his pledge to cut property taxes so that the levy on a typical home in 2018 is lower than it was in 2010. Current claim Walker’s new claim refers to a specific measure -- an estimate of the hypothetical property tax on a median-valued, or typical, Wisconsin home. The estimates are done by the nonpartisan state Legislative Fiscal Bureau. That tax was $2,963 for 2010-’11, just before Walker took office; and it’s $2,832 for 2017-’18. 2010-’11 2011-’12 2012-’13 2013’-14 2014-’15 2015-’16 2016-’17 2017-’18 2018-’19 $2,963 $2,953 $2,943 $2,926 $2,831 $2,849 $2,852 $2,832 $2,831 A caveat Todd Berry, president of the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, told us it’s important to note that levies -- the total property taxes collected -- have risen in each year but one during Walker’s tenure, even though the the tax on a median-valued home is lower than before he took office. The reason is that compared to commercial and manufacturing properties, residential values have lagged. As a result, more of the property tax burden has shifted to commercial and manufacturing and away from residential, Berry said. Our rating Walker says "property taxes are lower right now than they were" in December 2010 on a median-valued home in Wisconsin. Estimates done regularly by the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau show that the hypothetical property tax bill on a typical Wisconsin home is $2,832 for 2017-’18 -- $131 lower than the year before Walker took office. But it’s worth noting that the total amount of property taxes collected have risen in each year but one during Walker’s tenure. And that the drop in residential property taxes is due to commercial and manufacturing properties rising at a faster rate -- not due to collecting less taxes. For a statement that is accurate but needs additional information, our rating is Mostly True.

pomt-03098	"In fiscal year 2011-2012, 4,191 abortions were paid for by taxpayers via the Oregon Health Plan."	true	/oregon/statements/2013/sep/24/oregon-2014/does-oregon-health-plan-pay-about-4000-abortions-y/	A group called Oregon 2014 is trying to collect enough signatures to put a measure on the ballot that would prohibit taxpayer spending on abortions. The group tried to do the same in 2012 but failed to collect enough signatures. In any case, on its website is this statistic: "In 2012 there were 9,015 abortions in Oregon. In fiscal year 2011-2012, 4,191 abortions were paid for by taxpayers via the Oregon Health Plan." The suggestion came to us via a reader, who had heard a signature gatherer cite the statistic. Was it true? We contacted Oregon 2014 right away, where a co-chief petitioner said the statistic was solid and that he welcomed a fact check. "I’ve been called a liar to my face," said Jeff Jimerson, "and I try to direct them to the information." The information comes from the Oregon Health Authority. The number of abortions paid by the state has fluctuated from 4,105 in 2002-03 to 3,424 in 2008-09 to 4,191 in 2011-12. This is the most up-to-date information available, said Karynn Fish, an OHA spokeswoman. But isn’t there a restriction on using public money to finance abortions? There is. The Hyde Amendment, first approved by Congress in 1976, prohibits the use of public money to pay for abortions, except in case of rape or incest or to save the mother’s life, for the most part. This affects low-income women who receive health care through federal Medicaid. In response to the Hyde Amendment, Oregon’s Department of Human Resources then issued a rule limiting reimbursement for abortions. People sued. The appellate court voted the rule unconstitutional, in that it violated the equal privileges and immunities clause of the Constitution. In 1984, the Oregon Supreme Court took a different approach, ruling that Human Resources had overstepped its rule-making authority, which was to pay for medical services for needy people. In Oregon, the Health Plan uses a mix of federal and state monies to provide health care for low-income residents. Oregon is among a minority of states that allow using state taxpayer money for elective abortions. Petitioners hope to change that by adding these words to the Constitution: "No public funds shall be used to pay for any abortion, except when medically necessary or as may be required by federal law." We may see this measure on the 2014 ballot; we may not. But it is accurate to say that state taxpayer money paid for about 4,000 abortions in the most recent year available.

pomt-01585	"Miller Brewing is not a U.S. company any more. Neither is Anheuser-Busch."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/sep/08/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-miller-brewing-and-anheuser-busch-a/	During an appearance in Milwaukee, U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan delved into the growing controversy surrounding inversions, the practice of U.S.-based companies buying foreign firms and then relocating their own headquarters to another country to enjoy lower taxes. Bloomberg News reported that nine U.S. companies are planning tax inversions this year. The most recent and highest profile case came in August 2014 when Burger King said it planned to buy Canada-based doughnut chain Tim Hortons and relocate its own headquarters from the United States to Canada. In an appearance before the Rotary Club of Milwaukee and the Milwaukee Press Club, Ryan was asked if inversions should be banned. He said that the U.S. tax code needed reform and that American-based companies pay far more in taxes than their counterparts in other countries. "The trend we have seen lately are foreign companies buying U.S. companies for many reasons, like tax reasons," said Ryan, R-Janesville. "Simply putting up a fortress around America with these anti-inversion rules, all that we'll end up doing is accelerate the takeover of U.S. corporations by foreign corporations." Ryan then popped open a claim involving one of Brewtown’s icons. "Miller is not a U.S. company any more. Neither is Anheuser-Busch," he said. "Think of what this does to our communities. The royalties, the headquarters and all that." Yes, beer and politics get mixed up again. A few weeks back, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke told an ABC News interviewer that she favored New Glarus Brewing Co.’s Spotted Cow to Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy, because Spotted Cow was available only in Wisconsin. After asking around to see if that was widely known, we checked it out and rated it True. When we asked our beer drinking cohorts about where Miller and Bud were based, we got some of the same stumped looks. After all, Milwaukee is where Frederick J. Miller bought the Plank Road Brewery and founded Miller Brewing Company in 1855. "He brewed his delicious beer using yeast that he carried in his pocket from Europe," the company’s history says. Although Miller is still brewed in Milwaukee (and elsewhere), the company is no longer based here. In 2002, South African Breweries, already one of the largest breweries in the world, bought Miller. That created SABMiller. In 2008, SABMiller added the the U.S. business of Molson Coors, creating MillerCoors. The new company moved its headquarters from Milwaukee to Chicago, while the corporate parent is based in London. Brewery employment has remained about the same in Milwaukee at about 750 workers, the company said in June of 2013. The number of corporate office jobs in Milwaukee, including sales and marketing and executives, declined by about 370 to 607. What about Bud? Meanwhile, TV ads for Anheuser-Busch’s flagship brew, Budweiser often feature a heavy Americana feel, with red, white and blue and tributes to returning soldiers and small towns. But today the corporate parent is a long way from St. Louis, where its roots date to 1852. In a hostile takeover, the international conglomerate InBev bought Anheuser-Busch for $52 billion in 2008. Anheuser-Busch is now one of many subsidiaries and the deal resulted in hundreds of jobs being cut, including many in St. Louis. The full name of the company is now Anheuser-Busch InBev. The headquarters is in Belgium. The company leaped over SABMiller to become the largest brewer in the world. Before the company bought Anheuser-Busch, InBev grew from a combination of Belgian breweries, the addition of Labatts in Canada and breweries in Russia, China, Germany and Brazil. Since then, the company has added Mexico’s Grupo Modelo, according to a history on the company’s website. "I don't think the tax code was a driving factor for any of the mergers," said Eric Shepard, executive editor of Beer Marketer’s Insights, a trade publication. "AB InBev was more about other synergies," he said. "They probably don't mind a lower tax rate, however." In addition, moves into new markets are necessary because beer sales are flat in the United States and Europe, according to a Sept. 3, 2014 profile of AB InBev in Forbes. "Amid stagnating beer sales in developed markets, comprising North America and Western Europe, the brewer has looked to tap into the growth potential of emerging beer markets such as Brazil, Mexico, China and South Korea, mainly by acquiring small regional brands and leveraging its strong marketing and advertising muscle," the article said Our rating Ryan cited two well-known beer makers -- including one founded in Milwaukee -- when asked about inversions. He said the parent companies of Miller and Anheuser-Busch are located overseas. They were part of a long-standing and rapid world-wide consolidation of the major breweries.

pomt-14235	"We have tougher standards holding toy gun manufacturers and sellers to account than we do for real guns."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/14/hillary-clinton/new-york-debate-clinton-says-us-has-higher-account/	Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders voted for a law that gave higher standards to toy guns than real guns, opponent Hillary Clinton charged at the New York Democratic debate. A 2005 law put restrictions on people’s ability to sue the gun industry for crimes committed using their products. As Clinton often points out, she voted against this law, while Sanders voted for it. "We have tougher standards holding toy gun manufacturers and sellers to account than we do for real guns," Clinton said April 14. The claim that this law gives higher standards to toy guns is something Clinton has said in recent weeks. It’s not a settled question. Here’s why. A liability gap? The law at issue is the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which was signed into law by President George W. Bush and seen as a victory for gun rights advocates. The purpose of the law is to protect gun dealers and manufacturers from lawsuits when their products are misused, meaning if a gun dealer legally sells a person a gun, and then the buyer uses the gun to commit a crime, the gun dealer and manufacturer cannot be held liable for the crime. The law arose after victims, cities and states started to bring lawsuits against gunmakers that pursued new legal paths, such as one that argued manufacturers Glock Inc. and China North Industries had oversaturated the market, producing so many guns that it was inevitable some would fall into criminal hands. Most judges dismissed these kinds of lawsuits, but a minority allowed them to proceed. There are several situations that are not protected from lawsuits under the law. It does not protect gun dealers who transfer a gun knowing it would be used for criminal purposes, nor those who knowingly break state or federal law if the violation results in harm. Gun manufacturers can also be sued if the gun, when used properly, causes injury because the product is defective. Opponents argue that the law stops some victims from having their day in court because the liability immunity is so broad and ambiguous, while the exceptions are narrow. Supporters, though, say the law protects gun dealers and manufacturers from frivolous and expensive legal proceedings. We’ve written before that Congress has passed laws giving some other industries varying levels of immunity. A couple experts told us Clinton’s statement is unsound because the law sought to impose equivalent, rather than fewer, standards for gun makers that are already established for manufacturers of other products. As it stands, the victim of a crime committed with a toy — say, if a person seriously injured another person by shooting them with bb gun pellets — generally cannot sue the toy manufacturer, just as they can’t sue Toyota or Budweiser if they’re struck by a drunk person driving a Prius. The 2005 law "basically put gun manufacturers in the same position that other product manufacturers are in," said Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California Los Angeles. "They’re responsible for defectively manufactured and designed products but not for failing to prevent criminal misuse of their products." Additionally, toy guns and real guns pose fundamentally different risks because real guns are much more likely to be used in a crime than a toy gun, said Timothy Lytton, a Georgia State University law professor who edited a book on suing the gun industry. So before the law, the gun industry was subject to a wider range of liability that just doesn’t apply to a toy. As such, it’s hard to imagine a realistic incident with a toy gun that would cause someone to bring a suit against the toy company, yet they would not be able to sue a gun manufacturer for an equivalent situation involving a real gun. A hypothetical situation might be if a city experienced an epidemic of deaths or injuries that resulted from a prevalence of realistic-looking toy guns; think of the recent story of Tamir Rice, a Cleveland child carrying a toy gun who a police officer shot and killed, said Alexandra Lahav, a professor of civil procedure at the University of Connecticut School of Law. In that case, a city might want to bring a suit against the toy gun manufacturer or seller for creating a public nuisance. But under the 2005 law, a city cannot sue a gun company if there is an epidemic of people being injured or killed by their guns. Lahav added, though, that she thinks the idea someone would bring a suit like this against a toy company is highly unlikely. In theory, there might be a liability gap between toy guns and real guns, but that wouldn't necessarily play out in reality, she said. Toy and real gun manufacturers can be sued for product defects that cause injury when the product is used as intended. But if an injury is caused by a product defect coupled with a criminal misuse of the product, a toy gun manufacturer could be held liable, but a real gun manufacturer could not under the 2005 law, said Adam Winkler, also a UCLA law professor and an expert in the Second Amendment. That limits the gun industry’s incentives to make their products as safe as possible. The fact that a party cannot even attempt to bring these kinds of lawsuits against real gun manufacturers sets them apart from other industries, including toys, said Mark Geistfeld, a law professor at New York University and an expert in products liability. Such lawsuits against the gun industry might be destined to fail, but the 2005 law doesn’t even allow for the arguments to be tested. "You’ve granted an immunity to the gun industry that you haven’t granted to any other industry," Geistfeld said of Sanders, noting that this supports the gist of Clinton’s point: that Sanders holds guns to a lower standard. Lytton noted, though, that he would not presume to know whether Sanders or anyone else who voted for the law would grant similar immunity to the toy industry if the opportunity arose. "It’s not fair to basically enter into hyperbole that somehow he treated firearms differently (so) he would come down harder on toy guns," Lytton said. Our ruling Clinton said, "We have tougher standards holding toy gun manufacturers and sellers to account than we do for real guns." She’s parroting a line she has stated previously. Clinton points to a 2005 law granting the gun industry certain immunity from lawsuits. In her camp are scholars who believe the law made the gun industry less susceptible to liability than other industries, including the toy gun industry. But other scholars think the law made the gun industry’s liability about the same as that of a toy gun manufacturer. And because real guns carry so much more risk for injury than toy guns, it’s hard to compare them effectively. This is a complex legal question, on which reasonable minds can disagree, so we rate Clinton’s claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4319fa9b-87b6-473d-a29c-487b2e070a6c	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-04-14T21:53:08	2016-04-14	['None']
pomt-00522	"Two weeks ago, a man entered the world’s busiest airport in Atlanta, Georgia, carrying a loaded AR-15 automatic weapon with an extended-capacity, 100-round magazine."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2015/jun/23/hank-johnson/johnson-errs-description-airport-gun-right-about-c/	When Jim Cooley carried his AR-15 rifle fully loaded with a 100-round drum into Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport last month, it revived a Georgia congressman’s efforts to restrict weapons in airports nationwide. U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Lithonia, cited the incident in again proposing the Airport Security Act, which would ban loaded weapons outside airports’ security areas. Federal law already bans carrying weapons through airport security checkpoints. "Two weeks ago, a man entered the world’s busiest airport in Atlanta, Georgia, carrying a loaded AR-15 automatic weapon with an extended capacity, 100-round magazine," Johnson said in a House floor speech June 15. "Mr. Speaker, actions like this, which follow shootings at airports in Los Angeles and Houston, undermine public security in the same way as yelling ‘fire’ in a crowded theater." Johnson’s proposal has been assigned to the House Homeland Security Committee, where the political battle over gun control will continue. But something in the rhetoric caught our eye for a closer look. Was the rifle in question at our airport an automatic weapon? THE HISTORY The AR-15 that Cooley carried is most likely the most popular such rifle on the market today. That is in part because several variants have been made since Colt started selling its version of the rifle as a semi-automatic weapon to civilians in the early 1960s. One modified version of the firearm was adopted as the M-16 rifle, deployed by the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War era. Several different manufacturers have since made versions of the rifle for private use. But the term "AR-15" has consistently been used to refer to the semi-automatic version Colt made popular. A fully automatic version is not sold directly to civilians. The federal assault weapons ban prohibited some versions of the AR-15 – such as those with collapsible stocks and bayonet lug – sold to civilians between 1994 and 2004. However, AR-15s built before the ban were legal – as were versions designed to comply with the federal law. Those loopholes effectively kept various forms of the AR-15 in production. For instance, admitted movie theater shooter James Holmes used a version of the AR-15 in the Aurora, Colo., massacre in 2012 that would have been illegal under the federal ban. But similar versions, including the Colt Match Target rifle, would have been legal, according to a 2004 University of Pennsylvania study funded by the National Institute of Justice. AUTOMATIC VERSUS SEMI-AUTOMATIC So, it’s clear the rifles can be deadly. In fact, semi-automatic weapons are often more deadly than the scarier sounding automatic versions, said Jay Corzine, a sociology professor at the University of Central Florida. That boils down to the difference between the two: Automatic weapons fire continuously when the shooter pulls the trigger once. The firing stops only when you release the trigger. Semi-automatic weapons will automatically reload, but the shooter must pull the trigger for each shot fired. Many law enforcement agencies that use small arms rifles, such as for SWAT teams, prefer semi-automatic weapons because there is less recoil in firing them. That allows for better aim, Corzine said. Nearly all AR-15 rifles are manufactured as semi-automatic weapons, in part because of that accuracy. However, gun shops do sell converter kits and manuals, which allow the rifles to be turned into automatic weapons that wouldn’t differ at a glance from the semi-automatic version, Corzine said. "An automatic firing mechanism is not more lethal in number of people killed, but you will end up with more people hit," Corzine said. "If you are shooting into a crowd, you’re going to hit a lot of people." IN GEORGIA The 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting that killed 26 children and school staff prompted Connecticut, Maryland and New York to join three other states with heavy restrictions or outright bans on the AR-15. But Georgia is not one of the states with restrictions. Likewise, Cooley was legally able to sling his AR-15 over his chest because of a 2010 state law that allows weapons in areas not covered by airport security. Cooley, who lives in Winder, said he brought his gun and the high-capacity magazine for safety when dropping off his daughter for a flight. His weapon, he said, is a semi-automatic rifle. "If you look at the video, the officer called my rifle an automatic weapon, and I had to correct her," said Cooley, who posted a video of his visit to the airport while carrying the weapon. "It is a semi-automatic rifle. To say it’s not is untrue. You can’t just say anything you want on the House floor." In his floor statements, Johnson cited the economic role that airports, especially Hartsfield-Jackson, play in communities as a reason to regulate guns for safety concerns. Johnson was at meetings in the United Nations when we reached out to him. Ben Waldon, his director of intergovernmental affairs, told us the congressman concedes he misspoke in calling Cooley’s weapon an automatic rather than a semi-automatic weapon. Waldon added that the 100-round drum also was a concern, regardless of the status of the weapon. Studies indicate limiting high-capacity magazines can affect gun violence since they are involved in more crimes (about 25 percent) than automatic and semi-automatic weapons (2 percent to 8 percent). Small-capacity magazines require the shooter to reload, which gives bystanders a chance to intervene as they did in the 2011 shooting of U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords that killed six. "Mr. Cooley’s weapon was a semi-automatic. But it is an assault rifle, with a high-capacity magazine," Waldon said. "The congressman feels these kinds of weapons stoke fear, not civility, and the incident in Atlanta demonstrates the extremes of allowing these kinds of guns in airports." OUR RULING U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson cited a recent incident of a man carrying his AR-15 rifle in Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in reviving his efforts to ban weapons from all areas of airports. Johnson called the gun an "automatic weapon," something he and his staff concede was incorrect. The gun owner has confirmed he owns the semi-automatic version of the rifle. That is the more common make of this weapon, although all sides and experts acknowledge the weapon can be converted to an automatic weapon. The bigger concern was the 100-magazine drum. Even in a semi-automatic weapon, that would allow a shooter to fire 100 rounds before reloading, the scary prospect that Johnson appeared to want to reference in his statement. Johnson got the gun wrong, the magazine for the weapon right. For that reason, we rate Johnson’s statement Half True.

pomt-04635	"With the auto rescue," President Barack Obama "saved more than 1 million middle-class jobs all across America," including more than 28,000 in Wisconsin.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/sep/14/jennifer-granholm/obama-auto-rescue-saved-28000-middle-class-jobs-wi/	In a high-volume, arm-pumping speech at the Democratic National Convention on Sept. 6, 2012, former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm proclaimed that President Barack Obama saved the American automobile industry. It’s a claim, made repeatedly at the convention, that PolitiFact National has said is on pretty solid ground. But Granholm got more specific. "With the auto rescue," Obama "saved more than 1 million middle-class jobs all across America," said Granholm. She continued by claiming jobs saved in a number of states, such as the election battlegrounds of Florida (35,000), Michigan (211,000) and Ohio (150,000). She said more than 28,000 jobs were saved in Wisconsin alone. For us, Granholm’s claim really has three parts: the U.S. and Wisconsin jobs-saved figures; whether those jobs were "middle-class"; and whether Obama deserves full credit for saving the jobs. Let’s turn the ignition. Auto industry crisis Granholm, now a law professor and host of a talk show on Current TV, is a Democrat who served eight years as Michigan’s governor after being elected in 2002. She alluded in her speech to late 2008, when the auto industry was near collapse. As PolitiFact National has reported, layoffs at auto plants and among auto parts suppliers were on track that year to reach 250,000 workers. General Motors was virtually out of cash to pay its bills and Chrysler was not far behind. (Granholm stated in her speech that Republican Mitt Romney’s response at the time was to "Let Detroit go bankrupt." But as our colleagues noted in rating that claim Half True, it was a New York Times staff writer who put that headline on an opinion piece penned by Romney in which he advocated a "managed bankruptcy" with new management, new labor agreements and federal guarantees for post-bankruptcy financing.) The auto rescue began under President George W. Bush, who just before leaving office gave Chrysler and GM more than $17 billion in loans. (Ford never asked for assistance.) Then in 2009, Obama provided $80 billion in relief. Some was offered as loans to the automakers, but much more was given in exchange for stock. The Italian car company Fiat became the majority stockholder of Chrysler; the second-largest owner is the autoworker union’s retiree health care trust fund. For GM, the U.S. government now owns about one-third of the company, private shareholders about one-third and the retiree trust fund 10 percent. Number of jobs saved Obama’s campaign said the evidence for Granholm’s claim comes from a May 2009 study produced by the Center for Automotive Research. The center is an independent research group based in Ann Arbor, Mich., that gets some funding from automakers. The study, released as the auto bailout was still playing out, made projections based on whether Chrysler and GM went through quick bankruptcies ("best-case" scenario) or lengthy bankruptcies ("worst-case" scenario). Under the best-case scenario -- bankruptcy filings and settlement with debtors completed within 90 days -- an estimated 63,200 U.S. jobs would have been lost by the end of 2009, the study said. That included 9,700 direct jobs, with the rest coming from automaker suppliers and "spin-off" jobs -- jobs lost as a result of reduced spending by auto and auto-supplier employees. Under the "worst-case" scenario -- bankruptcy proceedings that were "disruptive and disorderly" and would "drag on" -- the U.S. would have lost 1.34 million jobs by the end of 2009, including nearly 204,000 direct auto jobs, the study estimated. For Wisconsin, the 2009 jobs loss was pegged at 1,766 under the best-case scenario and 30,513 under the worst-case scenario. Granholm then did some math, subtracting the best-case jobs number from the worst-case number. For example, for Wisconsin, she claimed the bailout saved more than 28,000 middle-class jobs (30,513 minus 1,765 equals 28,748). The math Granholm did isn’t done in the study. And it’s not clear if she was trying to be conservative by citing figures slightly smaller than the maximums. But Obama’s campaign did respond to our question on this point by noting that the Center for Automotive Research did a later study, in November 2010, estimating that the auto rescue -- by avoiding the worst-case scenario with drawn-out bankruptcy proceedings -- saved an estimated 1.14 million U.S. jobs, slightly fewer than the earlier estimate of 1.3 million jobs. Kim Hill, associate research director of the Center for Automotive Research, noted that other studies also produced estimates of more than 1 million U.S. jobs being at stake. They included one study from the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C. think tank, and another from the University of Maryland. But the Center for Automotive Research study Granholm relies on provided a range of job loss predictions, and Granholm chooses numbers that best serve her rhetorical purpose. Moreover, the study's figures were estimates, not actual counts of jobs saved. There’s no way to know whether close to the worst-case scenario would have emerged had Obama not provided the auto rescue. And the alternate scenario outlined in the same report showed a much smaller potential job loss. Types of jobs saved The study Granholm cited did not use middle-class or any similar term in describing the jobs saved -- and it’s a term that many people interpret differently. Hill, of the Center for Automotive Research, told us that more than half of the projected jobs saved could easily be classified as middle-class, given that average annual salary and fringe benefits exceed $60,000 for auto workers and $40,000 for auto supplier workers. But to claim that all of the more 1 million jobs saved were middle class "gets to be a stretch," he said. Obama’s role As for credit for saving jobs, Granholm gave it all to Obama. But Obama doesn’t get full credit because Bush’s aid to Chrysler and GM kept them afloat and bought time for Obama to decide how to respond to the crisis, PolitiFact National concluded in its article about whether Obama saved the auto industry. Moreover, our colleagues observed, no one can say what would have happened without massive government intervention. Our rating Granholm said that "with the auto rescue," Obama "saved more than 1 million middle-class jobs all across America," including more than 28,000 in Wisconsin. The two figures are drawn from estimates from an independent study -- but: it’s not certain that job losses would have reached those levels without the rescue; not all of the jobs projected as saved were middle-class jobs; and Obama deserves a major share of the credit for saving jobs, not all of it. Granholm’s claim was partially accurate but left out important details. On balance, we rate it Half True.

pomt-03336	"The president has had 1,540 of his nominations confirmed, only four defeated."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/22/mitch-mcconnell/obama-only-four-nominations-defeated-mcconnell-say/	The long-running Senate battle between Democrats and Republicans over the filibuster and delays in processing President Barack Obama’s nominations came to the brink this past week. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., threatened to use the so-called nuclear option and set aside the 60-vote majority needed to close debate and bring a nomination to the floor. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said if Reid did that, he was "going to be remembered as the worst leader of the Senate ever." The two sides healed the breach after many urgent phone calls and a meeting of every senator in the Old Senate Chamber, a room one lawmaker called "hallowed ground." But before the return to relative civility, McConnell had been on NBC’s Meet the Press where he argued that the president had done pretty well for himself. "What is the problem here?" McConnell asked. "The president has had 1,540 of his nominations confirmed, only four defeated." McConnell’s office said he meant to say 1,560. We checked, and he did use the correct number just three days earlier. We also looked at the Library of Congress nominations database for Obama’s first and second terms and confirmed McConnell’s numbers. But what drew our attention was McConnell’s claim that only four had been defeated. That number refers to people who failed on a measure to end debate (called "cloture) and send their names to the floor for a simple majority vote. It takes 60 votes to end debate. McConnell’s list includes Craig Becker (National Labor Relations Board), Caitlin Joan Halligan (U.S. Circuit judge), Goodwin Liu (U.S. Circuit judge), and Richard Cordray (director, Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection). However, that doesn’t account for many of the people Obama put forward who have withdrawn due to opposition from Senate Republicans. "McConnell is using misleading numbers," said Ian Ostrander, a political scientist at Texas Tech University. "He’s taking advantage of the fact that very few nominations actually fail through a direct vote." There are many ways to stymie a nomination. There is the threat of filibuster which requires clearing the 60-vote majority to end debate. Alternatively, opponents can run out the clock and return the nomination to the White House with no vote at all, generally right before the summer recess or at the end of the year. Or an individual senator, anonymously or publicly, can place a hold and block a nomination from moving forward. Ostrander said that the White House might withdraw a nomination, or never put someone’s name forward if minority opposition seems too strong. He cited the examples of Susan Rice, Obama’s first choice for Secretary of State, and Elizabeth Warren, his first pick to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Neither was ever formally nominated. Republicans didn’t like key aspects of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in the first place. In May 2011, 44 GOP senators sent a letter to the administration saying they "will not support the consideration of any nominee, regardless of party affiliation" until changes were made. When Obama replaced Warren with Richard Cordray, it made no difference in the Republican position. Cordray was the first stalled nominee to win confirmation immediately after the deal that averted the crisis in the Senate. Occasionally, Ostrander said, the nominee on their own steps back due to long delays. He put Federal Reserve Board nominee Peter Diamond in this category. Diamond, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, was nominated three times. Twice in 2010, the Senate did not reject him; it simply made no decision and returned the nomination to the White House. Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., worked hard against the nomination and never backed down. The White House nominated Diamond a third time in June 2011, but he withdrew saying he saw that his name would never make it to the Senate floor. Ostrander has studied more than two decades of non-judicial nominations. His doctoral thesis: Winning the Waiting Game: Senatorial Delay in Executive Nominations. Ostrander has detailed at what point nominations failed in the nomination process: 84 percent stalled or were withdrawn before going before a committee. Another 0.03 percent were rejected by a committee vote, while 0.01 percent were rejected in a floor vote. "McConnell is choosing to count as failures cases that only account for a small fraction of overall failures," Ostrander said. Overall, 69 of Obama’s nominees withdrew for any reason since 2009. During the first term, Ostrander said he counts 38 who likely pulled out under pressure from Republican opposition. We reviewed in detail 12 instances (beyond McConnell’s four) where nominees withdrew after encountering opposition, either to their specific background or to Obama’s policies. Those include Donald Berwick to head the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Erroll Southers to lead for the Transportation Security Administration, Michael Mundaca for the Treasury Department’s Office of Tax Policy, and Dawn Johnsen to be assistant attorney general, among others. There is an additional issue with McConnell’s measure of Obama’s success rate. We contacted five other political scientists, and they agreed that McConnell’s statement overlooked the impact of delayed nominations even if they ultimately win confirmation. In the book Defending the Filibuster: The Soul of the Senate, Richard A. Arenberg and Robert B. Dove said the filibuster is a moderating force and a check on executive power. We asked Arenberg if McConnell’s point about the president’s track record on confirmations was valid. "Clearly, it's not only the final outcome that matters," Arenberg said. "Delay in confirmation can certainly hamper an executive agency." Michael Gerhardt, a law professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law, has studied the nomination process. "The problem is not just the delays; it is the limited authority of an acting or temporary head," Gerhardt said. "Here, the statistics might not accurately capture the harm done to the executive branch." Our ruling McConnell said Obama faced no real problems getting his nominees confirmed by the Senate, saying that only four of 1,540 nominations had been defeated. His office later said he misspoke and the number should have been 1,560. We find he's partially accurate but is leaving out some important details. Yes, it's true that when nominations reach a final vote, the vast majority have been approved by the Senate. But this accounting ignores those who withdrew before a vote, including the estimated 38 who withdrew after Republican opposition. It also does not account for high-profile figures such as Susan Rice who were never nominated because of opposition. We rate the claim Half True.

A Feb. 26, 2017, article on TheSeattleTribune.com says in a headline, "Trump’s Android device believed to be source of recent White House leaks." The post was flagged by Facebook users as being potentially false, as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat fake news. The readers got this one right. The story is fake. The story says two "private intelligence agencies" have determined that several news leaks that have been damaging to the Trump administration — from plans for executive orders to internal fights with staff — likely came from the president’s own phone. But TheSeattleTribune.com is a website that makes up their stories, and is associated with another faux news site called AssociatedMediaCoverage.com. Their disclaimer says the website "is a news and entertainment satire web publication" and that all articles "are fictional and presumably satirical news." If the counter on the story is to be believed, this one has been viewed more than 171,000 times in less than a week. It’s been used in online forums and also is popular on Facebook. It’s even appropriated a Twitter hashtag. The article claims #DitchTheDevice is an online effort by social media users to get Trump to quit using the phone. But really, that hashtag was formerly used to try to get people to stop staring at their phones all day long and enjoy life a little bit more. In any event, that’s what the hashtag means now, as thousands of people have used it while tweeting out TheSeattleTribune.com link. The story keys off a maelstrom of news about leaks from the White House, combined with Trump’s penchant for tweeting and his reported actual use of an unsecured Android phone. But this story?

pomt-01805	Obama’s 2012 policy on younger immigrants "created these children coming across" the border.	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/23/lou-dobbs/dobbs-obama-policy-young-immigrants-created-crisis/	One of the consistent talking points among conservatives discussing the thousands of kids arriving at the U.S. border is that President Barack Obama’s 2012 immigration policy is responsible. The policy allowed certain young people without legal status to apply for a two-year deferral of any removal proceedings. Though it does not apply to people just now crossing the border, conservatives say it gave children and their families the idea that they could try. And so they have. We’ve heard that thinking from former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Republican strategist Karl Rove and now, Fox Business News host Lou Dobbs. "This president and his administration knew what was happening with the issuance of the executive order in 2012, which created these children coming across," Dobbs said on July 21, 2014. There is a problem with the claim, however. The dates don’t line up as neatly as people are letting on. The deferred action policy In June 2012, about four months before the presidential election, the Obama administration issued a memo saying it would allow certain young people without legal immigration status to apply for a two-year deferral of any removal proceedings. That deferral could be extended and anyone who was accepted would also gain the ability to work in this country. Generally speaking, it targeted people who had come across the border with their parents when they were little and had lived in the United States for many years. The move came after Republicans rejected a bill, the DREAM Act, that would have put these immigrants on a path to citizenship. To qualify, people had to show that they came to the country before they were 16, had lived here continuously since 2007, had never been convicted of a crime, were age 30 or under, and were either in school or had at least a high school education or had served in the armed forces. The government began accepting applications in mid August. Tracking the rise of children coming to the border The Congressional Research Service is a nonpartisan body that delivers policy research for Congress. In a June 2014 report, analysts included a chart showing how many new children had been handed over to the Office of Refugee Resettlement. Under a 2008 law aimed at protecting young victims of human trafficking, this is the agency responsible for taking care of unaccompanied minors apprehended by U.S. border or immigration agents. The chart measured the number of children processed by month, so we can get a better picture of how things played out along the border. The numbers don’t include children stopped at the border and immediately sent back, but they do mirror the overall trends. As you can see, monthly referrals largely were steady between October 2008 and January 2012. They then started to rise between January and April 2012, months before Obama announced his executive action. After that, they plateaued until January 2013, when they grew exponentially. Based on this chart, the rate of arrivals nearly doubled before Obama announced his new policy. Overall, there is not a simple cause and effect relationship that Obama issued his policy and arrivals went up. But this isn’t to say that Obama’s policy played no role in the current flood of children arriving at the border. The administration tacitly acknowledges some relationship. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson published an open letter in key Central American countries in which he made the point that the new policy would not apply to children who show up today. "A child must have been in the United States prior to June 15, 2007 – seven years ago," Johnson wrote. In a report on the causes behind the current crisis, congressional researchers said many factors are driving the flood of children at the border. Those fleeing El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras account for most of the influx. Those countries suffer from high rates of crime and poor economies. Surveys found that about half of the children had been harmed or threatened by gangs or agents of the state. Children did not tend to come from Central American countries with less crime and better economies. The same surveys found that many of the children sought to join family members already living in the United States. The 2008 revised trafficking law is another potential factor. It opened a new legal option for unaccompanied children from countries other than Mexico and Canada. They can apply for asylum on the grounds that if they were sent home, they have good reason to fear that they would face persecution. It is unclear if fear of gang-violence meets that condition. Nevertheless, the children are getting a hearing and while they wait for the process to play itself out, they remain in this country. Our ruling Dobbs said the Obama policy directed at younger immigrants created the the problem at the border. The initial rise in arrivals began before Obama announced the policy and if anything, plateaued or declined a bit immediately afterward. However, the administration went out of its way recently to send the message that the policy did not apply to newcomers, suggesting the policy played some role. The influx of children comes mainly from the most troubled nations in Central America. The claim that Obama’s policy created the influx does not match the timeline and ignores other important factors. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-01839	Former President George W. Bush and former Vice President Dick Cheney are "unable to visit Europe due to outstanding warrants."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/17/facebook-posts/are-george-w-bush-dick-cheney-unable-visit-europe-/	Former President George W. Bush and former Vice President Dick Cheney have been out of office for more than five years, but that doesn’t mean the rest of the world has forgotten about them. In many countries, policies that Bush and Cheney spearheaded to fight terrorism continue to color views of the former United States leaders -- most notably the opening of the detainee center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and the use of waterboarding and other "enhanced interrogation" methods that many consider torture. A reader recently sent us a social media meme that captured this sentiment. It shows a photograph of the two men, with the caption, "When I was growing up, I would never have believed that a former president and vice president of the United States would be unable to visit Europe due to outstanding warrants." The idea that Bush and Cheney could be arrested overseas isn’t entirely far-fetched. In 1998, Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet was arrested in London after Spain requested extradition for charges related to the murders of Spanish citizens in Chile during his time in office. In addition, Israeli politicians Tzipi Livni and Dan Meridor canceled trips to the United Kingdom in 2009 and 2010 amid threats of legal action, in Livni’s case for an Israeli strike on Gaza and in Meridor’s case an Israeli raid on a Turkish ship headed to Gaza. (The British government later changed the law, allowing Livni and others to make subsequent visits.) In 2005 Donald Rumsfeld nearly pulled out of a conference in Germany until receiving prosecutors’ assurances that he wouldn’t be arrested, according to the Guardian. Bush attracted significant media attention in 2011 when he canceled a trip to Geneva, Switzerland, to address the United Israel Appeal. A lawyer for the group told a Swiss newspaper that the cancellation stemmed from concerns about protests, not fear of arrest. Given all this, we wondered: Are there really outstanding warrants against Bush and Cheney from a legitimate authority, as the meme suggests? And are the two men in any danger of being arrested if they leave the United States? So we took a closer look. Arrest warrants and the International Criminal Court Interpol, the international police organization, does not list any outstanding arrest warrants for Bush or Cheney in their searchable database. Meanwhile, experts in international law said they were not aware of pending warrants, particularly from the most obvious entity that might issue one -- the International Criminal Court in the Hague. The ICC is a permanent, independent court that investigates and brings to justice individuals who commit war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, according to the Congressional Research Service. Cases may be referred to the ICC either by a member state, the court’s own prosecutor, or the U.N. Security Council. The court only investigates and prosecutes serious crimes by individuals (not by organizations or governments), and then, only when national judicial systems are unwilling or unable to handle them. However, the ICC "has not issued warrants for any American citizen, let alone for Bush, Cheney, or anyone else," said Anthony Clark Arend, Georgetown University professor of government and foreign service. Brett Schaefer, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, said that the ICC has undertaken two preliminary examinations involving Iraq and Afghanistan -- an early step in the process. But in neither case does action seem imminent. In the case of Iraq, the prosecutor has said that the ICC lacks jurisdiction for several reasons, including that Iraq is not a party to the statute that established the court, and that the U.N. Security Council has not referred the situation to the ICC. Action on Afghanistan, which is an ICC party, is more plausible, and the preliminary examination first made public in 2007 is ongoing. However, Schaefer said, "it is uncertain whether the court will actually proceed to a formal case." But even if the ICC did advance its investigation to a later stage, the most important takeaway is that neither Bush nor Cheney would be personally at risk. While 122 nations have become members, the United States has not -- and that makes a big difference in cases such as this. While the court may prosecute individuals from ICC-state parties, such as the United Kingdom, for alleged crimes even in places like Iraq where it does not have jurisdiction, Schaefer said, the fact that the United States is not a party -- at least for now -- means "this is not an issue for President Bush or Vice President Cheney." Obstacles to prosecution It’s conceivable that national courts could take action instead, experts say. But while some non-governmental human-rights groups have pushed for criminal prosecutions, the experts we checked with were not aware of any pending, and public, warrants for Bush or Cheney. An obstacle to a national-court prosecution of Bush or Cheney is that "most states don't have laws allowing for prosecution based on universal jurisdiction -- the international law principle that allows any state to try certain serious crimes, no matter where committed," said Steven R. Ratner, a University of Michigan law professor. "And some that do have cut them back in recent years due to fears of a flood of litigation or foreign-policy concerns." A state that did seek to prosecute Bush or Cheney would face both the practical difficulty of carrying it out as well as an expected diplomatic backlash from the United States. "No state has any interest in arresting a former U.S. president or vice president," Ratner said. "Say goodbye to good relations with the U.S.!" This reality, he said, makes the likelihood of a prosecution of Bush or Cheney "highly doubtful." Where Bush and Cheney have traveled outside the United States We couldn’t find any examples of Bush or Cheney visiting Europe, but they have traveled to other countries since they left office. Bush visited Haiti as part of an effort by the charitable foundation he co-founded with former President Bill Clinton after a devastating earthquake in the Caribbean nation. And Bush also joined Clinton at a regional economic summit held in the Canadian province of British Columbia. Cheney, meanwhile, has gone to British Columbia to promote his book, In My Time: A Personal and Political Memoir. But these trips weren’t without turbulence. Typically, protesters have followed both Bush and Cheney at such events. At his book event, Cheney faced a crowd of 200 people chanting and holding signs that said, "Cheney War Criminal" and "Torturer," according to the Canadian television network CBC. The incident was serious enough for police to don riot gear, and it led to one arrest. As for Bush’s trip to the regional summit in Canada, it attracted a similar-sized crowd but was somewhat more peaceful, according to the CBC. Meanwhile, both Bush and Cheney have canceled speaking engagements in Toronto, though their camps did not cite concerns about arrest warrants as the reason. Cheney cited "personal safety" concerns, while Bush chalked it up to a "scheduling change." Our ruling The meme on social media said that Bush and Cheney are "unable to visit Europe due to outstanding warrants." The claim that there are "outstanding warrants" is flat wrong. And while it’s theoretically possible for a national court to issue an arrest warrant against either man, as was done with Pinochet, there is no sign of that happening. We rate the claim False.

pomt-00134	Says Beto O’Rourke "voted to shield MS-13 gang members from deportation."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2018/oct/25/donald-trump/mostly-false-donald-trump-claim-beto-orourke-voted/	President Donald Trump, stirring Texas supporters, charged Democratic U.S. Senate nominee Beto O’Rourke with voting to shield violent gang members from deportation. Trump, urging voters at an Oct. 22, 2018, Houston rally to re-elect his onetime nemesis, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, said that O’Rourke, the third-term congressman from El Paso who opposes Trump’s avowed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, "even voted to shield MS-13 gang members from deportation." Trump went on: "He doesn’t want to deport them. He says they’re people, they’re people. They carve you up with a knife but they’re people." So, did O’Rourke vote to shield MS-13 gang members from deportation? We didn’t get a White House reply to our request for Trump’s factual backup. But we identified a 2017 House vote on a proposal related to deporting or not admitting criminal gang members to the United States. O’Rourke and an outside expert subsequently told us the Texan’s vote didn’t shield MS-13 members from deportation, which happens regularly under current law. What’s MS-13? It’s a misconception that MS-13 members hail entirely from abroad in that the violent group started in Los Angeles where many refugees from civil strife in El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua fled in the 1980s. In 2017, the Justice Department said there are an estimated 10,000 MS-13 gang members operating in at least 40 states. Members are concentrated in Los Angeles, Long Island in New York and the region outside Washington, D.C., the New York Times reported in March 2018. The Times, citing federal authorities, said the gang’s 30,000 other members live in Central America or Mexico. MS-13 stands for Mara Salvatrucha, which comes from the words "mara," a Spanish term for gang, "salva," for El Salvador, and "trucha," slang for cunning. The "13" refers to the thirteenth letter of the alphabet, or "M," which denotes the gang’s allegiance to the Mexican Mafia, a prison gang, DOJ said. In 2012, MS-13 became the first street gang to be designated by the government as a transnational criminal organization when President Barack Obama did so. Our October 2018 search of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement website yielded more than 270 web pages detailing actions against MS-13 members----including arrests, criminal convictions and removals. A 2017 House vote Another web search led us to see that the House in September 2017 voted mostly along party lines to send the Senate the Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act. As of October 2018, it still hadn’t received Senate consideration. In a news story at the time, The Washington Post said that the proposal "would allow officials to take action against suspected gang members, regardless of whether they've been convicted of a crime." Advocates said the move would enhance public safety. Before the vote, the White House issued a statement saying advisers would urge Trump to sign the measure into law should the House version reach his desk. That statement credited the proposal with giving "law enforcement needed tools to help ensure that criminal alien gang members are deported quickly and never again allowed to enter the United States." Separately, the American Civil Liberties Union said the measure "would promote racial profiling, erode due process and unintentionally affect others, such as clergy who try to help gang members," the Post story said. Immigrant advocates maintained "it would give law enforcement wide latitude in designating groups of people as gangs and seeking to deport, detain or block their asylum before a crime has been committed," the story said. By our read, the legislation would enable federal officials to designate criminal gangs, defined as five members or more bent on criminal activity, and permit a consular or law enforcement official not to admit a person to the U.S. if the official knows or has reason to believe the individual is or has been in a criminal gang--with no requirement that the individual have criminal convictions. Also, the legislation permits immigration authorities to start deportation proceedings against anyone in the U.S. believed to be or have been in a criminal gang. O’Rourke’s nay Next, we confirmed from a roll call vote that O’Rourke was among 174 Democrats to vote against the measure, which won House approval by 233-175. Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan was the sole Republican to vote "no." In floor debate, a co-sponsor of the proposal, Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, said that without the legislation, MS-13 members could legally stay in the U.S. unless they were convicted of deportable offenses, according to a transcript in the Congressional Record. If the legislation became law, Labrador told members, ICE would newly "be permitted to place alien gang members into removal proceedings on the grounds of being criminal gang members" as determined by specifications in the measure of crimes considered to be gang related, Labrador said. Labrador also said: "I have heard some uneasiness that ICE will use these provisions to charge any alien they encounter with gang activity. Our bill does not allow that." Under the measure, he said, ICE would have the burden of proof when charging an immigrant with a deportable offense. "The government must convince an immigration judge of its case," Labrador said. Democratic members countered that the proposal would enable the Department of Homeland Security to deny admission to or deport any immigrant, including one who has no criminal history or gang affiliation, so long as DHS believes the person is associated with such a group. Under the proposal, Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., said, there "is no need for conviction or even an arrest. All DHS needs is a belief that the individual has assisted any group of five or more people that DHS believes has committed one of these long list of offenses," Lofgren said. Zofgren also suggested the legislation could lead to a religious group that aids immigrants facing charges. "This isn't just theoretical," Lofgren said, going on: "During the 1980s, members of the faith community were repeatedly criminally prosecuted for providing transportation to undocumented immigrants." There was a related vote. By 220-184, members rejected a Democrat’s motion to have the proposal amended to bar the deportation of any person "for action taken on behalf of a religious organization whose primary purpose is the provision of humanitarian assistance or aid." O’Rourke voted in favor of the motion. O’Rourke campaign disputes characterization By email, Chris Evans of O’Rourke’s campaign responded to our inquiry about Trump’s claim by disputing the president’s characterization of O’Rourke. Existing law, Evans said, "makes immigrants who commit crimes related to gang activity deportable." O’Rourke, Evans wrote, "believes in ensuring MS-13 members are held responsible for their crimes under our justice system and he believes in enforcing our current immigration law." We also heard back from David Bier, an immigration policy analyst for the libertarian-rooted Cato Institute. Bier, a former staff adviser to Labrador, called Trump’s claim about O’Rourke incorrect. Calling the legislation a "political effort," Bier told us by phone that significantly, neither the White House nor other supporters of the measure had identified examples of MS-13 members the government couldn’t deport without the House-approved changes in law. "If there were any examples," Bier said, "they’d be displaying them." Does existing law shield gang members? Stepping away from the legislation, we wondered whether existing law shields MS-13 gang members from deportation. Early this year, PolitiFact looked into whether MS-13 members detained in the U.S. were being let go by authorities. To the contrary, Steve Yale-Loehr, who teaches at Cornell Law School, responded that the government by law must detain individuals who have committed certain crimes while going through deportation proceedings. He pointed out provisions in federal code requiring the government to take into custody any individual convicted of a range of offenses including those involving firearms, illegal drugs or aggravated assault. Yet individuals can seek asylum if they have suffered persecution or fear they will suffer persecution due to race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. Yale-Loehr said: "If an individual caught along the border claims asylum, he or she will have their claim reviewed by an asylum officer with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. If they can show they have a credible fear, the individual goes through the immigration court process. If they don’t have a credible fear, or if an immigration judge denies their asylum claim," they will be deported, Yale-Loehr said. But immigration experts said that it’s difficult for gang members to receive asylum. Fatma E. Marouf, a professor of law and director of the Immigrant Rights Clinic at Texas A&M University School of Law, said: "If the gang member persecuted others or committed a serious crime in the United States or his country of origin, he would likely be barred from asylum." If a gang member or criminal can somehow make a substantive case that their asylum argument should be heard, the immigrant would be allowed to stay in the United States until their hearing. They would typically post a bond to do so. Critics call this wrinkle "catch and release." Yale-Loehr said Border Patrol agents and ICE officials can release people in this way, under what is known as prosecutorial discretion. In addition, immigration judges can allow immigrants in deportation proceedings to be released after they pay a bond, if they meet certain conditions. "But that is happening less and less often under the current administration, and the government is certainly not required to release people who may be deportable, Yale-Loehr said in February 2018. He cited a Department of Homeland Security memo that drastically cut back on the practice in February 2017, shortly after Trump was inaugurated. Our ruling Trump said O’Rourke "voted to shield MS-13 gang members from deportation." We see an element of truth to this claim because O’Rourke did not vote for a Trump-backed measure pitched as easing deportations of suspected criminal gang members. But we spotted no evidence that O’Rourke’s "no" was a vote to shield violent gang members from deportation. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-15065	Tens of thousands of Atlanta households pay more than 30 percent of their income towards rent.	true	/georgia/statements/2015/sep/25/matthew-charles-cardinale/claim-about-atlantas-affordable-housing-hits-mark/	For somewhere between $1,400 and $4,000 a month, you can rent in the luxury apartment complex Inman Quarter in Atlanta’s Old Fourth Ward. But you’ll also need to earn at least $48,000 – and up to $160,000 – a year to afford skyline views without spending more than 30 percent of your income on a (fancy) roof over your head. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and Census Bureau both consider those who pay more than that to be "cost burdened," since they may have difficulty paying for other necessities such as food and medical care. Housing advocates, including Atlanta Progressive News CEO Matthew Charles Cardinale, worry that those people are getting lost in the newly energized Atlanta housing market. "Tens of thousands of Atlanta households are cost-burdened, meaning they pay more than 30 percent of their income towards rent," Cardinale recently wrote in the Saporta Report. "This includes more than 25,000 cost-burdened renter households subsisting on $20,000 or less per year," he continued. In a market of gleaming new developments targeting high-end renters, do that many people needed less pricey options? PolitiFact Georgia decided to check. Housing in Atlanta We reached out to Cardinale to ask his source, and he pointed us to a 2015 update of last year’s Atlanta’s housing strategy report. A chart on page 10 of the report, shows about 27,000 households that make $20,000 or less and another 13,000 households with incomes between $20,000 and $35,000 spent more than 30 percent of their income on housing in 2012. Cardinale said that shows the city’s own data back up his proposal, to require new developments list how much of their complexes will be at or below 30 percent of the city’s median income, as well as how many will fall between 30 and 50 percent, between 50 and 80 percent and more than 80 percent. "It would basically be an affordable housing scorecard, not requiring projects to include affordable housing but to provide information on what’s being done," Cardinale said. The recommendation has been pending in a City Council committee since November. Yet Mayor Kasim Reed has, under the housing strategy, pledged to cut by 10 percent the number of residents who are cost burdened on rent by 2020, according to an opinion piece this summer by his deputy planning commissioner. The Census estimates The city may have its work cut out for it on that front. To verify the strategy report, we looked at the Census data cited in the chart. The 2012 American Community Survey estimates that of 103,219 households in Atlanta in 2012, 50,509 of them spent 30 percent or more of their income on housing. That’s 49 percent of city households – and 10,000 more than plotted in the city’s chart. The survey for 2014, released just last week, isn’t even that rosy. Of 105,999 households now estimated in the city, 52,787 of them paid more than 30 percent of their income on rent in the past 12 months. That’s just a hair under half of households. The only improvement? Those scrambling the most to keep up with rent – households spending more than 50 percent of their income on housing – dipped by 574 households, to 27,100 in 2014. That’s a full percentage drop – but still 26 percent out of city households. How does Atlanta stack up? For context, PolitiFact Georgia tried to find out if one out of every four households spending half of their income for a place to sleep was unusual. Sadly, not really. Renters are on the rise in the 11 most populous American metro areas, Atlanta included. A May report by New York University's Furman Center, which studies real estate and urban policy, and Capital One bank, found each of those cities saw the amount of rental housing grow faster than any increase in owner-occupied homes in 2013. Yet despite that growth, renters everywhere struggled to keep up with increasing rents and shrinking vacancies. Atlanta, for instance, saw the vacancy rate drop from 16 percent to 9.9 percent between 2006 and 2013. Median monthly rents, meanwhile, jumped 8 percent in that period, from $888 to $963. And in Atlanta and the other 10 cities, more than three out of every five low-income renters were severely rent burdened – paying more than half of their income on rent. Our ruling A left-leaning housing advocate championed a scorecard of new housing development in Atlanta by claiming that "tens of thousands" of households in the city paid more than 30 percent of their income on rent. They do, whether looking at the city’s housing strategy plan or the 2012 U.S. Census estimates that shaped the report. By 2014, those estimates had grown even worse. And, Matthew Charles Cardinale would have been on target with an even more dramatic claim: More than a quarter of Atlanta households spent more than half of their incomes on housing. Atlanta faces the same challenges as other large cities in serving a growing rental population. To do so will require the right data. And Cardinale hits the mark with his claim about affordable housing in Atlanta. We rate his claim True.	None	Matthew Charles Cardinale	None	None	None	2015-09-25T00:00:00	2015-09-13	['None']
pomt-03425	"If you are born poor in America, we rank ninth or tenth in our citizens’ ability to climb up through that ladder and get themselves into the middle class."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2013/jun/26/tim-ryan/rep-tim-ryan-says-united-states-ranks-behind-other/	After votes conclude for the day, members of Congress can book time at the U.S. House of Representatives’ podium to deliver floor speeches on their favorite topics. That’s what Youngstown-area Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan did earlier this month when he and California Democratic Rep. John Garamendi held forth on the "The American Dream," and obstacles the poor face in their efforts to improve their situation. "If you are born poor in America, we rank about ninth or tenth in our citizens’ ability to climb up through that ladder and get themselves into the middle class," Ryan told Garamendi, arguing that the United States had moved away from a philosophy it had until the mid 1980s when it made educational investments that facilitated people’s economic rise. Because the ability to rise from rags to riches is a key facet of the American Dream, we asked Ryan’s office where he got his sobering statistic about America’s lack of social mobility. Ryan spokesman Pat Lowry said it came from a March 2010 article in the British newspaper, The Guardian, which was reporting on a study produced by a Paris-based coalition of 34 countries, including the United States. The study performed by the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development found it is easier to climb the social ladder in other developed countries than it is in the United States, Italy and Britain. In that study, Denmark, Australia, Norway, Finland, Canada, Sweden, Germany, Spain and France all scored ahead of the United States in children’s ability to exceed their parents’ income. The study found that in the United States, Italy and the United Kingdom, at least 40 percent of the economic advantage that high-earning fathers have over low-earning fathers is transmitted to their sons. In countries with more social mobility, just 20 percent of that advantage carries into the next generation. "Policies that facilitate access to education of individuals from disadvantaged family backgrounds promote intergenerational wage mobility, and are also likely to be good for economic growth," the study said. Its findings echo similar research conducted in the United States. A 2008 report on economic mobility produced by the Pew Charitable Trusts and Brookings Institution found that while "Americans have an optimistic faith in the ability of individuals to get ahead within a lifetime or from one generation to the next, there is growing evidence of less intergenerational economic mobility in the United States than in many other rich, industrialized countries." It noted yet another study that showed U.S. social mobility lags behind Canada and several other northern European countries, but observed that other research has found U.S. social mobility exceeds that of developing countries such as Ecuador, Peru and Brazil. The research on developing countries equated America’s level of social mobility with that of Pakistan and Nepal, though it cautioned that statistics for developing countries are harder to come by because they lack income surveys that span three or more decades, so researchers must estimate how much money participants’ parents made. During the 2012 election cycle, Republicans including presidential candidate Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania and vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan of Wisconsin observed that mobility in the U.S. lags behind other countries. A 2012 New York Times article on the subject cited some of the factors that hinder social mobility in the U.S., like pay tilted toward educated workers and the magnitude of the gaps between the rich and middle class. It notes the U.S. "maintains a thinner safety net than other rich countries," and that "poor Americans are more likely than foreign peers to grow up with single mothers. "That places them at an elevated risk of experiencing poverty and related problems, a point frequently made by Mr. Santorum," the article says. "The United States also has uniquely high incarceration rates, and a longer history of racial stratification than its peers.". While it flies in the face of the notion that anyone can rise from the bottom to the top in the United States, a number of studies uphold Ryan’s contention that America’s social mobility lags behind that of many other countries. America’s exact ranking in those studies depends on which countries are surveyed, but the research Ryan alluded to did find the U.S. to be 10th among the 12 examined countries. However, it is important to clarify that those 12 were all developed countries, and other research has found that U.S. social mobility exceeds that of developing countries. Ryan did not qualify his statement to reflect that. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Tim Ryan	None	None	None	2013-06-26T06:00:00	2013-06-11	['United_States']
pomt-14707	"The 90 percent statistic of supporting background checks, that's been debunked."	false	/punditfact/statements/2016/jan/05/laura-ingraham/laura-ingraham-say-claim-90-support-gun-background/	Gun control advocates often cite the statistic that 90 percent of Americans support expanding background checks for gun purchases. President Barack Obama just did it in his Jan. 1, 2016, weekly address. But conservative radio talk show host Laura Ingraham says that statistic is not accurate. "The 90 percent statistic of supporting background checks, that's been debunked," Ingraham said on Fox News Sunday on Jan. 3. "Lots of the myths about gun ownership are perpetrated by people who never much liked the Second Amendment in the first place and who have a vested interest in amassing more power in Washington, D.C." PolitiFact has rated this 90 percent statistic True as recently as October. So we decided to try and figure out what Ingraham was talking about when she said this is a myth that has been debunked. Go to the polls Under current law, background checks are required in sales by federally licensed gun dealers, but the checks are not required for gun sales by private sellers. National polls conducted in 2015 consistently show that around 90 percent of Americans support some sort of expanded background checks for gun purchases. Here are a few examples: Quinnipiac University poll, conducted Dec. 16-20: "Would you support or oppose a law requiring background checks on people buying guns at gun shows or online?" Support: 89 percent. Oppose: 9 percent. Unsure/No answer: 1 percent. CBS/New York Times poll, conducted Oct. 21-25: "Do you favor or oppose a federal law requiring background checks on all potential gun buyers?" Favor: 92 percent. Oppose: 7 percent. Unsure/No answer: 1 percent. Gallup poll, conducted Oct. 7-11: "Would you favor or oppose a law which would require universal background checks for all gun purchases in the U.S. using a centralized database across all 50 states?" Favor: 86 percent. Oppose: 12 percent. Unsure: 2 percent. Quinnipiac University poll, conducted Sept. 17-21: "Do you support or oppose requiring background checks for all gun buyers?" Support: 93 percent. Oppose: 6 percent. Unsure/No answer: 1 percent. Pew Research Center poll, conducted July 14-20: Do you favor or oppose "making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks"? Favor: 85 percent. Oppose: 13 percent. Unsure/Refused: 2 percent. Pew found that support for background checks spans all partisan and demographic groups, and it is also favored by a majority of households that own guns and those that do not. So are all of these polls wrong? We reached out to Ingraham’s producers and didn’t hear back. We couldn’t find any sort of definitive debunking of this stat, but we did find that some gun rights advocates have taken issue with this statistic for reasons such as the survey questions referring to the general idea of background checks rather than specific legislation. For example, in 2013, polls found that 90 percent of Americans supported expanded background checks. However, when Congress failed to pass a popular bill that would have increased background checks, 47 percent were disappointed or angry that it failed, while some 39 percent were relieved or very happy, according to a Washington Post/Pew Research Center poll. Some gun rights activists took this as proof that the 90 percent figure was phooey. This highlights an odd discrepancy: While people overwhelmingly support specific gun policy ideas, like universal background checks and banning suspected terrorists from buying guns, the support is not as robust when it comes to actually expanding gun control. The same October CBS/New York Times poll that found 92 percent support for expanded background checks also shows 46 percent of Americans think laws covering gun sales should be either made less strict or stay the same. Just 51 percent said the laws should be made more strict. "People don't seem to like the idea of ‘gun control,’ but they still want the government to do more to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill," said Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California Los Angeles and author of Gunfight: The Battle over the Right to Bear Arms in America. Our ruling Ingraham said, "The 90 percent statistic of supporting background checks, that's been debunked." Numerous respected polls from 2015 show around 90 percent support for some sort of expanded background checks for gun purchases. While there are some questions as to what inferences can be made from these findings — such as whether that 90-percent support translates into support for specific legislation — there hasn’t been a definitive debunking of the statistic. We rate Ingraham’s claim False.	None	Laura Ingraham	None	None	None	2016-01-05T11:23:43	2016-01-03	['None']
pomt-11945	"Jason Aldean gig canceled after he sells out to liberals on ‘SNL’."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/oct/10/asamericanasapplepieorg/fake-news-site-says-jason-aldean-gave-anti-gun-scr/	A fake news story that said country singer Jason Aldean had a concert canceled after making an anti-gun statement following his Saturday Night Live performance is the work of a website that appears to be part of a troll network. "Jason Aldean gig canceled after he sells out to liberals on SNL," read the Oct. 8, 2017, headline on AsAmericanAsApplePie.org. Facebook users flagged the content as possibly being fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news stories. At least part of the story showed up in a couple of other posts also questioned by Facebook users. Aldean was performing onstage at a Las Vegas country music festival on Oct. 1 when a gunman opened fire on the crowd from a hotel room, killing 58 and injuring 489 more. He appeared for a musical performance on Saturday Night Live on Oct. 7, singing I Won’t Back Down, which also served as a tribute to Tom Petty, who died Oct. 2. The AsAmericanAsApplePie.org post, however, mixed some real details with some entirely fictional ones. It said Aldean addressed the audience before the song to say "people should not own more than one gun," and blamed the National Rifle Association for the massacre. Aldean did not do that. It then gives a real quote from Aldean, who said about shooting victims, "So I want to say to them, ‘We hurt for you, and we hurt with you.’ But you can be sure that we’re going to walk through these tough times together, every step of the way. Because when America is at its best, our bond, and our spirit, it’s unbreakable." You can watch the real statement and performance here: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The post snaps back into fake events by saying Aldean "took a knee" as the band played part of the national anthem, and told people "not to cave to the NRA’s terroristic agenda" and "always stand up to gun violence and the policies that enable it." None of those things happened, but the article said it spurred a #BoycottJasonAldean hashtag and led to the cancellation of Aldean’s concert in Birmingham, Ala. Aldean’s Birmingham show was Aug. 10. There is a #BoycottJasonAldean hashtag, but it’s difficult to tell if it stems from this fake story, which has fooled many people on Twitter, of Ultimate Fighting Championship president Dana White’s condemnation of Aldean for choosing to perform on SNL over UFC 216 in Las Vegas the same night. Aldean did cancel three California shows after the shooting "out of respect for the victims, their families and our fans," but returned to Las Vegas on Oct. 8 to visit with shooting survivors. AsAmericanAsApplePie.org has all the hallmarks of a series of fake websites associated with Christopher Blair, a self-described liberal troll who creates fictional stories to try to fool conservative readers. We’ve fact-checked plenty of stories that originated from websites run by or affiliated with Blair, including TheLastLineOfDefense.org, FreedomCrossroad.us, OurLandOfTheFree.com and FreedomJunkshun.com. AsAmericanAsApplePie.org uses the same website architecture as these other sites, and carries a disclaimer that reads, "As American as Apple Pie is here to be your beacon of something you can kinda rely on sometimes but not really." We reached out to the site but did not hear back. This fake story capitalizes on real events but inserts false details into the narrative to confuse readers. We rate it Pants On Fire!

pomt-08998	Republicans extended unemployment insurance under President Bush "when he asked to extend unemployment insurance."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/13/david-axelrod/republicans-supported-unemployment-under-bush/	Congress has been unable to agree how to boost the economy, creating headaches for President Obama and his Democratic Party. Obama adviser David Axelrod took questions on the issue from Jake Tapper on ABC News' This Week. "How can the president create jobs without there being any willingness on Capitol Hill to spend money to do so?" Tapper asked. Axelrod agreed there is "not a great appetite" for additional spending in Congress. "But I do think there are some things we still can accomplish. I do think that we can get additional tax relief for small businesses. That's what we want to do, additional lending for small businesses. They're an engine of economic growth. We're hoping we can persuade enough people on the other side of the aisle to put politics aside and join us on that. (And) unemployment insurance, we ought to extend unemployment insurance. People are suffering," Axelrod said. "You can't get the votes, though," Tapper interjected. "Well, we'll see. We'll see," Axelrod said. "But at a time when there's one job vacancy for five unemployed workers looking for jobs, clearly we have a responsibility to do it. The Republicans met that responsibility each time under President Bush, when he asked to extend unemployment insurance. They ought to do it now. Let's not play politics with this issue." We were intrigued by Axelrod's statement that Republicans helped President George W. Bush pass extensions for unemployment insurance. So we decided to fact-check it. A little background on unemployment insurance: When workers lose full-time work through no fault of their own, they are usually eligible for unemployment benefits, small weekly payments intended to partially make up for lost wages. Employers pay taxes to fund the program, and states administer it based on federal guidelines. How much a person gets and how long benefits are paid varies by state. Usually, the benefits last about six months. In tough times, though, Congress often extends benefits, because of the difficulty of finding new jobs when unemployment is very high, as it has been since 2008, when the economy floundered. As a result, Congress has been arguing this summer about extending benefits again after extending them five times since Obama took office in 2009. Recent extensions have been structured so that workers in states where unemployment is higher receive additional weeks of benefits. In the states where unemployment is highest, some unemployed workers have been paid benefits for close to two years. But the extensions have run out for some workers, and Congress has been unable to agree on whether to extend them again. That's the context in which Axelrod commented that Republicans extended unemployment for Bush "when he asked." We found several instances of President Bush signing into law unemployment insurance extensions. Some extensions were highly targeted, such as aid to airline workers after 9/11 and to victims of Hurricane Katrina. But Bush signed two general extensions in 2003 for 13 weeks each, with significant Republican support. He also signed extensions in 2008 with Republican support. We were unable to find any instances when Bush asked for an extension of unemployment benefits and Congress refused him. None of the experts we consulted could recall such a case. So Axelrod was technically right that Bush appears to have gotten Congress to extend unemployment insurance "when he asked." But in reviewing news articles on unemployment during the Bush administration, we noticed that, even when they supported extending benefits, Bush and Congressional Republicans were generally more skeptical than Democrats were. We noted that Republicans said then the same thing that some conservatives say now, which is that unemployment payments are a disincentive in some cases to taking a new job. Economists have noted this effect in studies, but they say that it is more significant during normal economic times. Axelrod's comment implies that Republicans were willing to extend unemployment insurance under Bush but are balking now that Obama is president. But we find the employment landscapes under Bush and Obama so different as to defy comparison. Extensions under Bush usually were for fairly short periods of time, such as two 13-week extensions in 2003. Also, some Republicans want the current extension combined with other spending cuts, to prevent the deficit from getting bigger. Projected deficits now are much larger than they were under Bush. Finally, it's worth noting that some reports indicate the unemployment legislation has failed to gain Republican support because Democrats have combined it with other measures. While Axelrod is right that Republicans supported Bush's proposals to extend unemployment benefits, it's important to note that there are differences between then and now. So, we rate his statement Mostly True.	None	David Axelrod	None	None	None	2010-07-13T18:13:57	2010-07-11	['George_W._Bush', 'Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-08239	If the state turns down money for high-speed rail, it will "kill nearly 10,000 permanent Wisconsin jobs."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/nov/15/sierra-club/sierra-club-says-killing-high-speed-rail-project-w/	The debate over the proposed high-speed rail line from Milwaukee to Madison percolated during the campaign for governor. It flared up on the eve of the election, and has raged since Republican Scott Walker was elected Nov. 2, 2010. Walker wants the project stopped, even if it means rejecting $810 million in already-approved federal money. After state officials signed contracts in a pre-election push to ensure the project moves forward, outgoing Gov. Jim Doyle has backed off -- but argues ending the project will cost taxpayers $100 million. Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, who lost to Walker, has said the city will consider legal options if the train is killed. Virtually everyone has entered the fight, often wielding statistics to argue their point. That includes the Sierra Club’s Wisconsin chapter. Weapon of choice: Jobs. In a news release and a petition, the Sierra Club argues if the state turns down money for high speed rail, it will "kill nearly 10,000 permanent Wisconsin jobs." If PolitiFact had sound effects, we’d add a loud whistle here. As in, that’s a lot of jobs. And as in, let’s have a timeout and get to the bottom of this. Many different job-related statistics have been bandied about in the debate. The state Department of Transportation estimates there are the 13,719 jobs involved in construction, engineering, design and train manufacturing tied to the project. On the campaign trail, Walker argued the project would create only 55 permanent jobs, declaring in an open letter to President Barack Obama on his notrain.com web site: "That’s $14.5 million per job, not including any hidden costs!" There, Walker is talking about jobs on the train line itself -- conductors, engineers, ticket-takers and the like. In making the claim, he is purposely choosing the smallest possible number to make his point. But what of the nearly 10,000 permanent jobs claimed by the Sierra Club and others, some of whom are now citing the Sierra Club as the source of the number? These are jobs not tied directly to the project and as such are hardest to measure hardest to quantify. Yet the group offers a very specific number: 9,572. The number comes from a 2006 economicanalysis prepared for Amtrak and nine states, including Wisconsin, a group called the Midwest Regional Rail Initiative. The study, prepared by Transportation & Economics Management Systems, became part of the state’s application for the train funding. The study says: "The development of the system integrates so many communities, and provides such a wide reaching impact that it will generate on its own a 0.1 percent growth to the region’s economy." The sweeping conclusion: "It will support existing manufacturing and service industries and will foster the growth of new small businesses across the Midwest because of the improved access between communities. It will encourage large businesses to distribute their operations more widely across the Midwest and reap the benefit of providing more efficient ‘back shop’ operations in the highly accessible smaller communities." OK, but how do you quantify all that? If you dig into the study, you find it is based on numerous assumptions and applies multipliers and other formulas to come up with a bottom line: Expanded train service would create 58,000 jobs in the nine states, boost property values by $5 billion and increase urban household income by $1 billion. Let’s look at some of the factors and underlying assumptions, with an eye toward how the Sierra Club and others are using them when they claim 10,000 permanent jobs are at stake with the Milwaukee to Madison line. Size of the system The numbers are based on the prospect of a fully-built system throughout the Midwest. That is, it’s not just high-speed rail from Milwaukee to Madison, but Chicago all the way to Minneapolis. And Chicago to St. Louis. And ultimately connections to Omaha, Kansas City, Indianapolis, Detroit, Cleveland and more. It even includes a spur to Green Bay, with proposed stations in Menomonee Falls, Fond du Lac, Neenah and Appleton. That piece alone accounts for 3,200 jobs in the study, some of which overlap with the Milwaukee jobs. But the federal funds allocated so far only cover some pieces of the plan. And there is no certainty the full system will ever be built -- in Ohio, Governor-elect John Kasich has vowed to block the Cleveland to Cincinnati to Columbus piece. So, even if Walker were to have a change of heart, the system may be smaller and have fewer connections, which could mean its jobs impact is smaller as well. Jobs gained, jobs lost The study suggests that new jobs and opportunities will develop around the new route, as more people take advantage of the high-speed connections. However, as people board the train they are taken off the highways and don’t as often take to the skies. But the study counts only the new jobs, not any lost ones. "How many airline pilots or contractors renovating terminals will not be needed?" said Steven E. Polzin, of the Center for Urban Transportation Research at the University of South Florida, an expert on rail proposals, whose group has been criticized for favoring cars and roads. "How many auto workers, gas station attendants, road contractors, etc." So, part of the equation is missing. Stations as economic hubs The study assumes that stations will become economic hubs, prompting other businesses to create jobs nearby. But the stations envisioned are no sure thing. For instance, the initial Madison station was to be near the airport -- not ideal for someone headed to the Capitol. Now it’ll be in the city center, but going into the city slows down a traveler from Milwaukee to Minneapolis. Leaders of some cities, including Brookfield and Wauwatosa, have said they don’t even want a proposed station. So, more uncertainty. Other travel options If the price of gas remains relatively low, there will be less incentive for travelers to get out of their cars and board the train. Indeed, cars may be able to make the trip faster -- assuming there’s no traffic congestion. Initial train speeds are planned to be 79 miles an hour, not including stops; the train would run at higher speeds later. Whats more, Mitchell International Airport is enjoying an air carrier -- and airfare -- war, which has helped it attract more passengers than ever. There is no telling how long that will last, but low air fares could have an impact on who grabs the train. Polzin, who reviewed the study at the request of PolitiFact Wisconsin, said it appeared to be professionally done, using methods that are generally accepted. He noted that such studies are usually done to build support for a project "and look exclusively at the benefits of the specific option, not the comparative benefits of other options or directing those resources to others purposes." Indeed, the state Department of Transportation has not highlighted the 10,000 permanent jobs figure, focusing instead on construction-related jobs for the Milwaukee-to-Madison line. "That’s work that we did ourselves," said Cari Anne Renlund, executive assistant for the state DOT. "We need to talk about what we know is real." We’ll leave Projection Land and return to reality as well. The Sierra Club’s Wisconsin chapter and others say killing the high-speed train will kill jobs, specifically 9,572 permanent ones. Their number is taken from a professional analysis, but that analysis is based on a host of assumptions -- including that an entire Midwest network is built -- many of which could change. And while the Sierra Club suggests the jobs are an immediate loss, the report itself puts them years into the future. The Truth-O-Meter isn’t a crystal ball. But it’s got a present-day rating that fits this claim: Barely True. (Note: Paragraph three of this item was changed on Nov. 16, 2010 to more closely reflect what Mayor Barrett has said in regard to the train and the city's options.) Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

He and other leaders at World Changers Church International in College Park launched Project G650 with the goal of raising nearly $65 million for the airplane, largely from $300-plus donations from 200,000 of the faithful. But negative public reaction to Dollar’s fundraising plea was so swift that it was halted within days of its launch. A promotional video featuring Dollar was quickly pulled down, but lives via YouTube. Some of the harshest words came from the faith community, including contemporary gospel’s Kirk Franklin who said: "When I camouflage my ‘greeds’ to look like ‘needs,’ that’s a shortage of character." Others asked: Why couldn’t pastor and evangelist Dollar conduct his mission travels as most do, via commercial airline, rather than a Gulfstream G650? We tried to reach Dollar directly but were referred to Juda Engelmayer, senior vice president at 5W Public Relations in New York. He is representing Creflo Dollar Ministries and has been fielding questions about the now-defunct fundraising campaign. In an article that appeared March 13, Engelmayer told The Christian Post that Dollar is now taking commercial flights when he visits churches in New York. But, "it’s not that simple," Engelmayer said, when a ministry team of 10 to 15 people "take thousands of pounds," even 100,000 pounds, "of food and provisions with them when they go around the world." That’s why the Gulfstream G650 is needed, he suggested. "The plane is not so Creflo Dollar can get on by himself and fly." Engelmayer made similar comments to the Associated Press. He said members of the ministry travel much of the year bringing their message, food and supplies to people around the world, and this jet has the fuel efficiency, speed, cargo space and seating the church needed. So is that a reason the ministry wanted donations of $65 million -- to have an airplane with cargo space capable of carrying thousands, possibly 100,00 pounds of food and other supplies? PolitiFact Georgia decided to check the facts. First a little background about the 53-year-old megachurch pastor and evangelist and how he came to say he was praying for a Gulfstream G650. Dollar preaches what is known as the prosperity gospel, a religious doctrine that financial blessing is the will of God for Christians. A native of College Park, he founded the non-denominational World Changers Church International, which boasts 30,000 members, 350 employees, an 81-acre campus and mission work on six continents. Dollar has long been criticized for being a preacher who lives a lavish lifestyle with Rolls Royces, million-dollar homes and jets. The tax exempt status of his ministry -- as well as five others -- was the focus of a U.S. Senate committee’s three-plus year investigation that started in 2007 and was based on public complaints and media reports about large salaries, lavish expenditures. Dollar protested the investigation, which closed with no findings of wrongdoing. Committee investigators said Dollar and the ministry at that time had four airplanes, including the one he wanted to replace with the $65 million Gulfstream. The plane World Changers and Dollar made the case for the new jet -- the Gulfstream G650, which is manufactured in Savannah -- after the church’s longtime Gulfstream G1159A, more commonly known as a G-III, was damaged and taken out of service last last year. They said the jet -- built in 1984 and purchased in 1999 -- traveled four million miles and had two recent mishaps: one where the right engine failed near Hawaii enroute to Australia; and a second in which the airplane’s nose hit a London runway while Dollar’s wife, Taffi, and three of his daughters were aboard. It was after these incidents, Dollar told potential donors on the video, "I knew it was time to begin to believe God for a new airplane." PolitiFact found a National Transportation Safety Board report confirming that older jet received "substantial airframe damage" in the accident that occurred on takeoff from London to Canada. Eight people were on the airplane, including one woman who was taken to the hospital with minor injuries. Aviation expert Richard Aboulafia confirmed that the jet likely would need to be replaced if it had substantial airframe damage. But Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at the Teal Group in Washington, said Dollar -- in proposing that the disabled jet be replaced with a $65 million G650 -- was suggesting going from "the old Honda to the new Rolls Royce." This 18-seat jet, which won aviation’s most prestigious honor, the Collier Trophy in 2014, is considered the best and fastest high-end corporate jet ever built. It’s the mode of travel for world governments, the very top echelon of business executives and likely the richest of the rich, he said. Does it have cargo space for thousands of pounds of food and other supplies? Experts told us the answer is no. Carrying cargo is not this jet’s mission, Aboulafia said. "If they make that claim [that they were buying the Gulfstream G650 to carry cargo], they're expecting the public to be a lot dumber than it is," he said. Cargo space on a business jet is measured in terms of golf bags, Aboulafia said. Steve Cass, vice president for technical marketing and communications with the jet’s manufacturer, Gulfstream Aerospace Corp., confirmed the jet’s space limitations. The G650 has room for 18 passengers and 2,500 pounds of baggage, Cass said. We sent an email to Engelmayer asking him to clarify his "cargo’ comments. He did not respond specifically to that request, but said there is "no campaign for a plane, and the ministry’s work helping people in need and spreading the gospel continues as it always has. "There is nothing more about this to discuss," he said. Rusty Leonard, founder and CEO of MinistryWatch.com said he was ‘disturbed, but not surprised" to learn Dollar was trying to raise money for a $65 million jet. "This is normal behavior for a prosperity gospel preacher who turns the gospel upside down by making it all about your/their own blessings/success rather than about sacrificially blessing others who are in need as Jesus actually taught," he said. His organization does not recommend donating to Dollar’s organizations, Leonard said. Our ruling: Dollar and other leaders in World Changers Church International launched and then dropped a campaign that asked followers to pony up $65 million for a top-of-the-line luxury jet. It’s an airplane generally reserved for world leaders, the top crop of business executives and billionaires. One rationale given for buying the aircraft was that the church needed to be able to carry thousands of pounds of food and other goods -- as well as ministers bringing the Word of God -- to other parts of the world. That argument never got off the runway. It is inaccurate and bordering on ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire.	None	Juda Engelmayer	None	None	None	2015-03-23T16:53:55	2015-03-13	['Bible']
pomt-07843	Says 25 percent of Austin's public school buildings are "underutilized."	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/feb/13/janet-mitchell/austin-school-district-task-force-co-chair-says-25/	Speaking to an Austin school task force’s exploration of possible Austin school closures, the volunteer group’s co-chair recently applauded alternative ideas yet warned that campus shutdowns aren’t off the table. Janet Mitchell told the Austin American-Statesman for a Jan. 20 news article: "The reality is that the (Austin school) district has a long-term inefficiency in utilization of school buildings. We have 25 percent of our school buildings that are underutilized. At some point... the community is going to need to decide whether we continue to invest in under-enrolled schools or whether we need to save those dollars to invest in teachers and programs." One in four schools--underused? We left a message for Mitchell, then asked the school district for elaboration. Joe Silva, assistant director for planning services, provided a spreadsheet listing each of the district’s 100-plus schools and whether each one is operating at, under or over the student capacity for which it was designed. Silva said the district has historically considered a campus under-enrolled if its school buildings, not counting portables, are at 75 percent capacity or less. He said the citizens task force set an under-capacity threshold of 85 percent. By the 85-percent threshold, 34 schools -- 31 percent -- are under-enrolled. By the usual district threshold, 22 schools -- 20 percent -- are under-filled. The calculations count both students who live in a school’s attendance zone and those attending via transfers. According to the spreadsheet, the district’s least-crowded school is Pearce Middle School, at 31 percent of capacity. The school normally serves more students; sixth grade wasn’t offered this year. Also least-crowded, according to the spreadsheet, are Becker Elementary, at 40 percent, and Blackshear Elementary, at 41 percent. Silva said that four of Becker’s permanent classrooms serve students shifted temporarily from their home schools to the disciplinary Alternative Center for Elementary Students. Those students aren’t counted in Becker’s enrollment calculation, he said, because the district can place the program at any location. Mary Saul, ACES’ director, told us that up to 36 students in the program occupy permanent classrooms at Becker. Silva initially told us that the district would describe under-enrolled schools as under capacity, not underutilized. That is, he said, many schools not filled with students still use their available space to offer add-on programs for students, families and the community. Also, he said, the district’s central administration places administrative and other staff in space available in the schools. He passed along campus survey results indicating that in 2009-10, 29 of the district’s 2,425 elementary classrooms, 1 percent, were used by principals for "discretionary" purposes, with others used for instruction, student and parental support or by district administrative staff. "Very few campuses are underutilized," Silva said. "But many are under capacity." Bumfuzzled? So were we, until Mitchell told us she’d said "underutilized" after seeing the term in a presentation to the school board. The 15-page presentation, "Facility Master Plan, Board Update," was shown to the board Jan. 10. It includes a page titled "Current Facility Inefficiencies" with this subhead: "Utilization (Permanent Capacity/Enrollment)." The page says the target utilization for the district is 85 percent to 105 percent; 27 schools -- or 25 percent -- are below the bottom target figure and 55 schools are above it. Silva later told us the results differ from the breakdown he gave us because the presentation used 2009-10 enrollment totals and ours had more recent enrollment totals. So, 25 percent or so of the schools are below target capacity for students, but that’s not to say most of their space isn’t being used. In fact, a key consultant on the master plan, Carolyn Staskiewicz, president of Ohio-based DeJong-Richter, told us in an interview that "utilization" -- a term reflecting the students enrolled in a school divided by the school’s capacity--could give the erroneous impression that the schools aren’t fully used. At her suggestion, we poked into the term--underutilization--by contacting the Arizona-based Council on Educational Facility Planners International. Spokeswoman Barbara Worth pointed us to Ron Fanning, chairman of the board of Ohio-based Fanning/Howey Associates, Inc., among the nation’s largest school architecture firms. Fanning agreed with Staskiewicz’s definition of utilization, but said it’s not the only factor to weigh in judging a school’s value: "You really have to look at each individual building" on its merits, "what it can hold, based on the programs being taught at that school... You can’t do a broad-brush statement." Stefan Pharis, who has a child at Barton Hills Elementary, told us the facilities task force has yet to take into account a comprehensive state measure of schools’ efficiency. According to online posts by the state comptroller’s office, the Financial Allocation Study for Texas (FAST), as ordered by the 2009 Legislature, reflects how districts and campuses spend their money -- and how the spending translates into student achievement. "There’s an implication when you say (a school is) underutilized, that somehow they’re wasteful in terms of spending," Pharis said. According to the comptroller, he said, "Some of these schools... excel academically and they do it at a cost-effective price." Our take: Mitchell’s statement accurately echoes the consultant-endorsed characterization of under-enrolled schools as being below their "target" utilization. However, "underutilized" is potentially misleading when applied to schools that may in fact be fully used, and could be targeted for closure as a result of that label. This is critical, missing context. We rate the statement Half True.	None	Janet Mitchell	None	None	None	2011-02-13T06:00:00	2011-01-20	['None']
pomt-06101	Wisconsin’s monthly job reports have a "margin of error" of 75 percent and were "way off" in eight of first 10 months of 2011.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jan/04/rebecca-kleefisch/preliminary-vs-revised-job-change-estimates-wiscon/	No doubt: the primary target of a massive recall campaign in Wisconsin is Republican Gov. Scott Walker. But Democrats and their allies are also collecting hundreds of thousands of signatures on petitions seeking to recall Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch. With the recalls as the backdrop, Kleefisch appeared Dec. 18, 2011 on WISN-TV’s weekly public affairs show in Milwaukee. Host Mike Gousha asked her about job creation, which is not on pace to meet the Walker campaign promise to create 250,000 private-sector jobs during his first term. "The last five months, we've lost private-sector jobs in the state of Wisconsin," Gousha said. "If the reforms are working, if the strategy is working, why are we losing jobs when other states are adding them?" Kleefisch began to smile and replied: "Well, first of all, I think we have to acknowledge how those figures come out. Our Department of Labor actually surveys only about 4 percent of job creators throughout the state of Wisconsin. And so we're talking about a margin of error of plus-or-minus 75 percent, like what we saw in October." Kleefisch also claimed the survey "has been way off" in estimating the number of jobs gained or lost in eight of the months since she and Walker took office in January 2011. She was referring to the difference between the preliminary and revised estimates that are done for each month. To be sure, Kleefisch and Walker did not complain the job estimates were unreliable when they showed job gains during the first six months of 2011. And "margin of error" is really a different measure -- how off the numbers are from reality, not from one estimate to the next. But in the interview, Kleefisch defined her terms, so viewers had a good sense of what she meant. So, is Kleefisch right -- do the state’s monthly estimates on jobs gained or lost have a discrepancy of 75 percent? And are the preliminary estimates often "way off" when compared to the revised estimates? How numbers are generated Let’s start with how the government generates its numbers. Each month, the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development, which is part of the Walker administration, releases employment statistics. The figures, which garner regular news coverage, include the number of jobs added or lost since the previous month. The numbers are not actual job counts. They are estimates produced by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics based on surveys it does of employers throughout the country. The method is statistically valid because the employers surveyed reflect the makeup of each state, said Ken Robertson, the federal bureau’s current employment statistics program manager. A preliminary estimate of the jobs added or lost each month is released after three weeks of surveying, Robertson said. The surveying continues, however, and a revised estimate is reported following the end of the month. The revised figures almost always vary from the preliminary ones because they are based on a larger number of surveys. Kleefisch’s claims Given that Kleefisch’s claims were made in connection with the recall campaign, we asked the the Republican Party of Wisconsin, rather than her staff, for evidence to back her claims. Spokesman Ben Sparks confirmed that Kleefisch was referring in the interview to the preliminary and revised job figures for October 2011. But she misidentified what she was citing. Kleefisch had been asked about private-sector job losses, but the 75 percent variation she cited actually was for private- and public-sector jobs -- that is, all jobs, excluding farm jobs -- according to the Department of Workforce Development figures. The preliminary estimate for October was a loss of 9,700 non-farm jobs in Wisconsin, with the revised estimate showing only 2,400 jobs lost. The revision, as Kleefisch suggested, was a 75 percent reduction. For private-sector jobs lost, the revision was actually higher -- 85 percent. But Kleefisch cited the October 2011 job figures only as an example -- claiming most of the 2011 monthly reports were "way off." How do the preliminary numbers compare to the revised job figures for the first 10 months of 2011? We’ll look at both private-sector jobs and total non-farm jobs, since the question dealt with the first and her answer the second. We calculated the percentages based on figures provided in the state Department of Workforce Development’s Dec. 15, 2011 report, the most recent monthly report available. Here’s an example of one calculation: In January 2011, the revised estimate was that 7,700 total non-farm jobs were added that month; the preliminary estimate was 6,200 jobs added. That’s a difference of 24 percent. Again, the following percentages represent the difference between the revised and preliminary estimates, not the rate at which jobs were lost or added each month. Total non-farm jobs January -- 24 percent February -- 58 percent March -- 15 percent April -- 52 percent May -- 22 percent June -- 16 percent July -- 22 percent August -- 78 percent September -- 11 percent October -- 75 percent So, the 78 percent variation in August was even higher than the 75 percent revision in October that Kleefisch cited. In the other months, the variances were significant, but considerably lower. The average variance over 10 months was 37 percent. (One note for perspective: An estimated 2.75 million people were employed in Wisconsin in October 2011. So, while the final estimate for the month -- 2,400 jobs lost -- was 75 percent smaller than the preliminary estimate, it represents a fraction of the total number of jobs in the state.) Private-sector jobs Here’s how much the preliminary and revised estimates varied on monthly job changes for private-sector jobs only: January -- 12 percent February -- 17 percent March -- 22 percent April -- 20 percent May -- 0 percent June -- 15 percent July -- 14 percent August -- 75 percent September -- 11 percent October -- 85 percent So, once again, the variations were 75 percent or higher in August and October. The average monthly variation was 27 percent, lower than for total non-farm jobs. Robertson of the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics said the August and October variations are "larger than we like to see." He said that, on the national level, variations of roughly that magnitude occur about once a year, but he didn’t know about individual states. Our conclusion Kleefisch said the monthly jobs numbers have a "margin of error" of 75 percent and were "way off" in eight of the first 10 months of 2011. In her response to the question, Kleefisch did some mixing of apples and oranges and using the phrase "margin of error" was misleading. But she did define her terms in the interview. The difference between the preliminary and revised numbers was 75 percent or higher in two of the first 10 months of 2011. As for "way off," on average, the variations between preliminary and final estimates in 2011 have been significant: 37 percent for total non-farm jobs and 27 percent for private-sector jobs. Kleefisch’s statement is partially accurate but left out important details -- our definition of Half True.	None	Rebecca Kleefisch	None	None	None	2012-01-04T09:00:00	2011-12-18	['None']
pomt-09692	Claims that Obama said, "For those who oppose our policies, you should just shut up and go away."	false	/florida/statements/2009/nov/11/cw-bill-young/us-rep-claims-obama-told-republicans-shut-and-go-/	Back in his Florida district, U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young decided to toss some red meat at the feet of a group of eager Republicans. Taking the microphone at Monday's meeting of the Pinellas Republican Executive Committee, Young said that President Barack Obama, during a recent campaign rally for a Democratic candidate running in Virginia, told Republicans to "go away." "He said, 'For those who oppose our policies, you should just shut up and go away,' " Young said to an overflowing crowd of Republican Party activists and insiders. "Well, we ain't gonna shut up and we ain't going away." When Young relayed Obama's message, some people in the audience gasped. Could the president have said that? Almost every word the president utters in public is saved, recorded or typed somewhere. That makes separating truth from fiction when it comes to Obama's public statements pretty easy. Let's get one part out of the way: After an exhaustive review of transcripts, newspaper stories and videos of Obama's recent campaign speeches, Obama never said the sentence exactly as Young attributed it to him. We did find the speech Young was referring to, however. It was given by Obama on Aug. 6 on behalf of Virginia gubernatorial candidate Creigh Deeds, and was referenced in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece written by James Taranto a few days later. At one point while writing about the speech, Taranto describes "Obama's petulant demand that his critics shut up and get out of the way." That's pretty much what Young relayed to the crowd of Pinellas Republicans. So we tracked down the transcript from the speech itself. The Virginia speech focused heavily on the economy and the president's support of a $787 billion stimulus package. He joked with the crowd that some Republicans are trying to blame him for the country's economic woes. "You've got folks on the other side of the aisle pointing at the federal budget and somehow trying to put that at our feet. Well, let's look at the history. When I walked in, we had a $1.3 trillion deficit. That was gift-wrapped and waiting for me when I walked in the Oval Office," Obama said. "Without my policies we'd have an even higher deficit going forward. The one exception is the recovery package that we had to do in order to get this economy moving again." Obama continued, "So you can't go out there and charge up the credit card, go on ... shopping sprees on things that didn't grow the economy, hand over the bill to us, and then say, 'Why haven't you paid it off yet?' I got that bill from (Republicans). So we've got some work to do. I don't mind, by the way, being responsible. I expect to be held responsible for these issues because I'm the president. But I don't want the folks who created the mess to do a lot of talking. I want them just to get out of the way so we can clean up the mess. I don't mind cleaning up after them, but don't do a lot of talking. Am I wrong, Virginia?" The last half of the quote, the "get out of the way," was picked up by the local newspapers covering the speech and spread from there. Conservative commentators like Taranto said it showed Obama's unwillingness to work with Republicans on bipartisan solutions. But the broader context shows that Obama's criticisms were more targeted. Specifically, Obama was criticizing Republicans who blame him for the country's economic problems, when -- he says -- many of the problems were created while Republicans were in power. That's a far cry from Young's report of Obama's statement -- "For those who oppose our policies, you should just shut up and go away." Young's statement is much more sweeping and dismissive than anything the president said. We rate Young's claim False.	None	C.W.

pomt-14166	Says an array of statistics show that conditions in some parts of Baltimore rival that of "the West Bank in Palestine," "North Korea," and "distressed cities in Nigeria, India, China and South Africa."	mostly true	/global-news/statements/2016/apr/28/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-conditions-baltimore-no-better/	Residents of some Baltimore neighborhoods are no better off than people living in impoverished North Korea and the violent West Bank, Bernie Sanders said during a campaign rally in Maryland ahead of that state’s primary. "Poverty in Baltimore, and around this country — poverty is a death sentence," Sanders said April 24. He then laid out some rather unflattering and harsh comparisons: "Fifteen neighborhoods in Baltimore have lower life expectancies than North Korea. Two of them have a higher infant mortality rate than the West Bank in Palestine. Baltimore teenagers between the ages of 15 and 19 face poorer health conditions and a worse economic outlook than those in distressed cities in Nigeria, India, China and South Africa. We are talking about the United States of America in the year 2016 — a country in which the top 1/10th of 1 percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent." While it would be wrong to take Sanders’ claim to mean that conditions overall are worse than Baltimore, we found that his specific comparisons are largely accurate. "The comparisons fairly make the point that there are some parts of this rich country where conditions resemble those in much poorer countries," said Alan Berube, an expert on urban poverty at the Brookings Institution. "This isn't isolated to Baltimore; there are neighborhoods in nearly every big U.S. city and metropolitan area, and many rural communities, that perform just as poorly on these outcomes." Let’s take Sanders’ claims one by one. Life expectancy in North Korea The Sanders campaign referred us to a Washington Post article noting that 14 Baltimore neighborhoods had shorter life expectancies than North Korea in 2013. (The article originally said 15 but was corrected.) His number is slightly outdated. In 2014, the latest year where there’s data on both places, the average life expectancy in North Korea was 69.81 years, according to the CIA World Factbook. That placed the impoverished dictatorship at No. 155 in longest lifespans out of 224 countries. The United States overall ranked at No. 42 with 79.56 years. Residents in 12 of Baltimore's 56 neighborhoods lived shorter lives, according to data from the Baltimore City Health Department provided to the Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance. That’s not 15, but it’s close. (For context, just five Baltimore neighborhoods have life expectancies higher than the U.S. national average, and four of them are relatively affluent and white.) Here’s a map from the University of Maryland’s Capital News Service that compares the life expectancies of Baltimore neighborhoods in 2013 to other places in the world: An important caveat: The city of Baltimore has a total population around 600,000 people while North Korea has a population 40 times that. That means fewer events in Baltimore neighborhood could swing the overall life expectancy of a neighborhood up or down. Infant mortality in the West Bank For this claim, the Sanders campaign referred us to a Vox article that said two neighborhoods in Baltimore — Little Italy and Greenmount East — had a higher rate of infant mortality than the West Bank, Honduras and Venezuela in 2013. But in his speech, Sanders only mentioned the West Bank. In 2014, 13.49 out of 1,000 babies died before their first birthday in the notorious conflict zone, according to the CIA’s World Factbook. The West Bank places in the middle of the pack in infant mortality at No. 117 out of 224 countries. The United States, meanwhile, ranked at No. 169 with a rate of 6.17 deaths per 1,000. In 2014, 11 Baltimore neighborhoods had a higher rate than the West Bank. In Hilltop and Little Italy, at least 20 out of 1,000 infants died before their first birthday. That’s not only higher than the West Bank, Honduras and Venezuela but also war-torn Syria and oppressive Uzbekistan. Teen health in distressed cities in developing countries Sanders claimed that "Baltimore teenagers between the ages of 15 and 19 face poorer health conditions and a worse economic outlook than those in distressed cities in Nigeria, India, China and South Africa." The Sanders campaign cited a Washington Post article by Johns Hopkins University researchers. "Teenagers in Baltimore face poorer health and more negative outlooks than those in urban centers of Nigeria, India and China," they write. Contrary to what Sanders said, the work by the Johns Hopkins researchers don’t consider economic outlooks nor do they show Baltimore conditions being worse than South Africa’s. Nonetheless, his broader point is accurate. The researchers published a comprehensive set of studies published in the Journal of Adolescent Health in 2014 that compared the well-being of teens in impoverished areas in Baltimore; Ibadan, Nigeria; Johannesburg, South Africa; New Delhi, India; and Shanghai, China. Baltimore teens reported the highest rates pregnancy and, after Johannesburg, the second highest rates of substance use, sexual and physical violence, and feeling unsafe in their community: Our ruling Sanders presented a series of comparisons showing that conditions in some parts of Baltimore rivaled that of "the West Bank in Palestine," "North Korea," and "distressed cities in Nigeria, India, China and South Africa. Some of Sanders’ figures need to be updated, but the gist of his specific comparisons are accurate: 12 Baltimore neighborhoods have a lower life expectancy than North Korea; 11 have a higher infant mortality rate than the West Bank; and research shows health conditions are worse for poor teens than in Baltimore than in Ibadan, New Delhi and Shanghai.

pomt-00626	Says he was known as "Veto Corleone" for cutting spending as Florida governor.	true	/florida/statements/2015/may/26/jeb-bush/saga-jeb-bushs-one-time-alias-veto-corleone/	Former Gov. Jeb Bush has resurrected an infamous moniker from his days in Tallahassee on the campaign trail in an attempt to show he is the godfather of fiscal conservatism. During a meeting with business leaders in Portsmouth, N.H., on May 20, 2015, Bush pointed out he was well-known for using the line-item veto at his disposal as governor. "They called me Veto Corleone, which was something I was quite proud of," Bush said, citing a reference to Marlon Brando’s character in The Godfather. He added that he vetoed 2,500 separate line items totaling $2 billion over his eight years. Bush has brought out that anecdote several times during the run-up to a presidential campaign, implying he would again focus on cutting wasteful spending. We wondered if he was accurate in claiming that nickname. We made our own inquiries and found that yes, pork projects really did sleep with the fishes. Offers he could refuse Bush came into office in 1999 vowing to use his line-item veto on state spending he didn’t like, and he followed through with a vengeance. He also wanted the state to focus on building reserves. That first year, he shocked lawmakers by slashing $313 million out of the $48.6 billion budget approved by the Legislature. It was more than double the previous veto record of $150 million set by Republican Gov. Bob Martinez in 1988. The Senate was so angry about the cuts, they sued Bush over his partial veto of funding for an extended school year. The Florida Supreme Court eventually ruled Bush defied the state Constitution by cutting $16 million out of a $40 million appropriation to keep schools open longer. They said he either had to cut all of the program or none of it. Media reports said John Thrasher, then speaker of the House, dubbed Bush "Veto Corleone" after the fictional mafia don (spelled Vito Corleone) for his liberal use of the power. Thrasher, who is now president of Florida State University, confirmed to PolitiFact Florida that he coined the nickname, which seemed to be something of a friendly dig. Thrasher’s collegial relationship with Bush was apparent in 2000, when Thrasher brought the budget to Bush’s office while wearing a white lab coat and a stethoscope "to make sure the governor has a heart." Bush answered by approving a couple of Thrasher’s pet projects, then chopping another $313.7 million out of appropriations. Here’s a look at how much Bush vetoed from each year’s budget: Year Total state budget Amount Bush vetoed 1999 $48.6 billion $313 million* 2000 $51 billion $313.7 million 2001 $48.3 billion $288.8 million 2002 $50.4 billion $107 million 2003 $53.5 billion $33 million 2004 $57.3 billion $349 million 2005 $64.7 billion $180 million 2006 $73.9 billion $448.7 million * The state Supreme Court ruled a $16 million veto in 1999 unconstitutional. The first year of Bush’s second term, in 2003, Bush cut a low of $33 million, but $7.2 million of that was funding for high-speed rail. Bush later led an effort to repeal a constitutional amendment requiring the creation of high-speed rail transit in the state. Bush also saved the most for last, hacking $448.7 million out of the 2006 budget, including a university tuition increase, spending on parks and police vehicles, as well as job training and education programs. That year state spending was up to $73.9 billion, a 52 percent increase from his first year in office. "It's never easy," Bush said in 2006. "You always hurt people's feelings. I don't enjoy that. And I'm always surprised that people are surprised. I've been consistent. There should be no surprises. And the people who really follow the budget knew that." We should note that if Bush wins the presidency, he likely won’t get to whack as much. A president doesn’t have a line-item veto and has to either accept or reject an entire piece of legislation. Our ruling Bush said "they called me Veto Corleone" as governor for his frequent use of the line-item veto. He did have a fondness for ruthlessly slashing projects he deemed wasteful or not in line with his agenda. Thrasher confirmed he nicknamed the governor after the fictional mobster. This is one favor we grant Bush. We rate the statement True.	None	Jeb Bush	None	None	None	2015-05-26T11:35:46	2015-05-20	['None']
pomt-07945	Says a "Canadian provincial prime minister came to Ohio for his medical treatment because of the delay in Canadian health care which would have endangered his life."	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2011/jan/26/bill-batchelder/ohio-house-speaker-william-g-batchelder-tells-heal/	New House Speaker William G. Batchelder loves telling a good story. With a legislative career in the Ohio House stretching back to 1968, Batchelder is well-known for his floor speeches peppered with political references and historical anecdotes from days long gone. Therefore, it was no surprise that Batchelder’s initial speech as the 101st House Speaker on Jan. 3 tied together the Ohio legislative session of 1937-38, the Roman historian Titus Livy, a lunch meeting with Florida Gov. Jeb Bush as well as the 1787 comments of Ben Franklin upon wrapping up the Constitutional Convention. After describing the challenges facing Ohio, the Medina Republican’s speech took a sunny turn as he mentioned the medical services in Ohio "that are second to none." In illustrating this point, Batchelder mentioned that the king of Saudi Arabia as well as a top Canadian official had sought treatment in Ohio. "The Canadian provincial prime minister came to Ohio for his medical treatment because of the delay in Canadian health care which would have endangered his life," Batchelder said. Beyond suggesting that Ohio medical treatment was first-class, Batchelder was also making a political point in suggesting that Canada’s universal health care system is second-rate. While the Cleveland Clinic’s care for Saudi royalty is well-known, Batchelder’s Canadian anecdote caught us by surprise. It seemed to us that if one of Canada’s premiers (as the top provincial leaders are known) had come to Ohio for medical care that it would have been a big deal, but it just didn’t sound familiar. So we put on our Politifact hardhat, and began digging. We first called Batchelder spokesman Mike Dittoe to find out more about where the claim originated. Dittoe told us that Batchelder personally inserted the reference into his Jan. 3rd speech, but didn’t have more details. Eventually, Dittoe got back to us that Batchelder told him "it’s on the tip of my tongue" but couldn’t quite recall the name. However, Dittoe said it was not former Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Danny Williams, who traveled to Miami in February 2010 for open heart surgery. It was the leader of one of the western provinces, according to Batchelder. Later, Dittoe reversed himself in an e-mail and wrote that it was Williams that Batchelder was referring to in his speech. He said that it had been "widely speculated" that Williams came to the Cleveland Clinic for "post-operative medical treatment" following his surgery in Florida. But, Dittoe acknowledged, there is no way to know for sure because HIPAA rules prevent the sharing of information of when a patient visits a doctor. Initially told to look west by Batchelder, we searched Canadian newspapers in the national capital of Ottawa and eight provincial and territory capitols from Ontario on westward and northward (Toronto, Winnipeg, Regina, Edmonton, Victoria, White Horse, Yellow Knife and Iqaluit for all you geography nerds) for references to a provincial premier getting health care treatment. During our search, we learned that Yukon Premier Dennis Fentie had cancerous tumors removed in 2007— in Vancouver. And we found out that former Ontario Premier Ernie Eves had emergency heart bypass surgery several years ago — in Toronto. But there were a whole raft of stories about Williams, who resigned his office in December. His February 2010 trip to Miami for specialized heart surgery was big news — and a public relations disaster up north — in all of the major Canadian newspapers. The initial stories didn’t say where Williams was getting treatment, but afterward news trickled out that it had taken place in Miami. Williams told the press that the health care treatment in Miami was better, and that he knew he would be criticized or perceived as a line-jumper if he stayed in Canada, where the special surgery has a waiting list. Not the same thing as saying your life is endangered by the Canadian health care system, but in the ballpark. More importantly, we didn’t find even find any references to any Canadian officials heading to Ohio for medical treatment. Much less for medical treatment that saved their life that was endangered because of delays in the Canadian system. As far as the Canadian press is concerned, a provincial premier has never come to the Buckeye State for medical treatment. Just to double-check on whether Williams had an Ohio stop for medical treatment, we called the St. John’s Telegram, the daily newspaper in the provincial capital. We spoke to Dave Bartlett, a reporter who interviewed Williams following the February 2010 heart surgery. "I’m fairly confident he never came to Ohio for any kind of treatment," Bartlett said. "My understanding is that he stayed in Florida for several weeks after the surgery and then he went to the Vancouver Olympics." So let’s take a look at what we’ve got cooking here: Batchelder claimed that a Canadian provincial premier came to Ohio for medical treatment that basically saved his life but could only remember that it was the head of a western province. And after scouring newspapers across eight Canadian provincial capitals, we could find nothing matching Batchelder’s description. Batchelder’s staffer said it definitely was not Danny Williams, former premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada’s easternmost province. Williams did have a trip south to Miami for specialized heart surgery. But then the staffer said it was Williams that Batchelder referred to in the speech and said it has been "widely speculated" that he came to the Cleveland Clinic for post-operative treatment. However, they had no proof of it. Meanwhile, a local Canadian reporter who covered Williams surgery said he is "fairly confident" he never came to Ohio for treatment. The Williams surgery in the United States was big news and it was initially unclear where in this country he was going for treatment. But by the time Batchelder made his speech in the House, it was 11 months after Williams had his surgery. Batchelder, as speaker of the House, is in a position of authority that also carries great responsibility. When he speaks, people listen. Yet neither he nor his office could point us to any concrete evidence that a high level provincial official came to Ohio for treatment. And given that the best they could come up with was that it was "widely speculated" that Williams might have come to Cleveland, the claim is more than just inaccurate; it’s ridiculous to a point that we’re ready to set the good speaker’s double-knits ablaze. We rate Batchelder’s claim Pants on Fire. Comment on this item.	None	William G. Batchelder	None	None	None	2011-01-26T06:00:00	2011-01-03	['Canada', 'Ohio']
pomt-00753	Says "all my grandparents" immigrated to America.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/apr/16/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-flubs-familys-immigration-history-/	Hillary Clinton this week became the latest example of a politician flubbing her family’s ancestry while making the case for her presidency. Clinton was speaking at a business roundtable inside an Iowa produce store when she related her personal family heritage to the struggles of undocumented immigrants trying to work in the United States. "I think if we were to just go around this room, there are a lot of immigrant stories," Clinton said, according to a video of the event. "All my grandparents, you know, came over here, and you know my grandfather went to work in a lace mill in Scranton, Pa., and worked there until he retired at 65. He started there when he was a teenager and just kept going. So I sit here and I think well you’re talking about the second, third generation. That’s me, that’s you." BuzzFeed’s Andrew Kaczynski quickly pointed out that Clinton was wrong, primarily using census and military records from Ancestry.com. An unidentified Clinton spokesman admitted the error in a statement to BuzzFeed, saying Clinton’s "grandparents always spoke about the immigrant experience and, as a result she has always thought of them as immigrants." While it’s clear Clinton is incorrect, and why her claim rates False on the Truth-O-Meter, we wanted to provide as much context as possible to this claim. Megan Smolenyak, a "genealogical adventurer and storyteller" who recently examined Clinton’s Welsh roots, can see where the campaign is coming from. Seven of Clinton’s eight great-grandparents were born overseas into working-class families. Clinton’s paternal grandfather, Hugh Rodham Sr., was born in England, but her three other grandparents were born in the United States. Hugh Rodham’s wife, Hanna (also Hannah) Jones Rodham, was born in Scranton, Pa., to Welsh parents a couple years after they emigrated. Census, civil and military records show Clinton’s maternal grandparents, Della and Edwin Howell, were born in Illinois. (Della’s mother was the one great-grandparent born in the United States.) Even though three of Clinton’s grandparents were born in the United States, Smolenyak said they probably strongly identified with their immigrant parents and older siblings, and she considers Clinton’s ancestors more "off the boat" than most politicians. Clinton is not the first person, famous or not, to potentially confuse family lore with the cold facts of her roots. Her misfire follows the misinterpreted family trees of U.S. Sens. Marco Rubio, who wrongly said his parents were Cuban exiles, and Elizabeth Warren, who claimed American Indian heritage while working as a Harvard professor. "We hold politicians to higher standards for accuracy in their family histories than we do genealogists and historians," Smolenyak said. "Your Great Aunt Tilly tells you something, and you believe it." Finding Hanna Jones Again, it is clear Clinton was wrong when she said "all my grandparents" immigrated to America. But Smolenyak recently upended the real story about one-quarter of Clinton’s roots. A few months ago, Smolenyak started researching Clinton’s Celtic connections for Irish America magazine. She was not expecting to find anything new in the well-documented background of a high-profile American, but she wrapped her investigation with a "wake-up call" for genealogists. Researchers had made critical mistakes in the background of Clinton’s paternal grandmother, Hanna Jones Rodham (born in Scranton), she found. At the beginning, Smolenyak knew she needed to search for records with names spanning all kinds of possibilities, as Jones is a common name in Wales , and a woman named Hanna could go by several names, including Annie, Anna, Hanna, Honora or Nora. (Americans weren’t as picky about the spelling of their names and records retention back then, she said.) Census records show two women born in the early 1880s in Lackawanna County, Pa., named Hanna (or Hannah) Jones. But researchers chose the wrong Hanna Jones and ran with it, wrongly assigning Hillary Clinton’s roots to that woman’s parents and creating a false echo chamber (PolitiFact can relate to the frustration). The wrong Hanna Jones, born in 1883, had a readily accessible birth record, but the right one, born in 1882, did not. Smolenyak confirmed the real Hanna Jones, Clinton’s grandmother, by picking up clues from records over time. A low-key marriage announcement in the Aug. 9, 1902, edition of the Scranton Times-Tribune offered potential proof that Jones and Hugh Rodham eloped in a nearby New York town where marriage had fewer restrictions: Ms. Anna Jones, of Brick avenue, was quietly wedded to Hugh Rodham, of Park place, at Binghamton, Memorial Day. Mr. and Mrs. Rodham will make their residence with the bride’s parents on Brick avenue. From there she could find out more information about the Joneses who lived on Brick in Scranton and match up what she knew about Hanna with other records about the family. Census records from 1910, 1920 and 1930 say Hanna (and also Hannah) Jones was born in Pennsylvania while her husband was born in England. Her parents are listed as born in Wales. PolitiFact found an unfinished application for a 1937 marriage license from Clinton’s father, Hugh E. Rodham, that lists the birthplace of both of his parents, Hugh Sr. in England and Hannah in Scranton. Interestingly, the marriage license does not list Hugh Jr.’s eventual wife and Hillary’s mother, Dorothy Howell, but another woman whom he did not marry, Catherine Meisinger. Our ruling Talking about immigration in Iowa, Clinton said, "All my grandparents, you know, came over here." It’s very clear from the evidence that not all of Hillary Clinton’s grandparents were immigrants. In fact, only one was. It’s possible she misspoke, but it doesn’t make her comment more accurate. We rate her claim False.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2015-04-16T16:47:39	2015-04-15	['United_States']
pomt-09059	"In her first appellate argument, Ms. Kagan told the court that the speech and press guarantees in the First Amendment would allow the federal government to ban the publication of pamphlets discussing political issues before an election."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/29/jeff-sessions/sessions-says-kagan-argued-government-could-ban-po/	In the Supreme court nomination hearings for Elena Kagan, Republicans quickly zeroed in on Kagan's first oral arguments before the Supreme Court as solicitor general in the landmark case Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission, which dealt with corporate financing of political materials. Taking the first crack in his opening statement was Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee: "In her first appellate argument, Ms. Kagan told the court that the speech and press guarantees in the First Amendment would allow the federal government to ban the publication of pamphlets discussing political issues before an election. "I would remind my colleagues that the American revolution was in no small part spurred by just such political pamphlets: Thomas Paine's Common Sense." To suggest that the government now has the power to suppress that kind of speech is breathtaking." Sessions' comment does get to the heart of the controversy surrounding the government's position on the case, but Sessions paints the substance of those arguments with a very broad brush and ignores the limits of the legal questions involved. The case before the Supreme Court challenged the application of a campaign reform bill known as the McCain-Feingold Act with respect to whether the nonprofit corporation Citizens United could air a video critical of then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. In a broader sense, though, the issue was whether the government had the authority to ban corporate or labor union funding of independent political broadcasts advocating for a candidate just prior to an election. In her oral arguments before the Supreme Court, Kagan argued that pamphlets were "pretty classic electioneering," and therefore fell into the category of corporate-financed election materials that could be limited by the McCain-Feingold Act. Now, corporations could still form separate political action committees (PACs) to get their message out. But Kagan said she argued in favor of the position taken by Congress that corporations and labor unions had such a "corrupting influence" on elections that they should not be allowed to directly fund political messages for or against a particular candidate very close to an election. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court went the other way, arguing that the First Amendment protects the speech of corporations and individuals alike. In his concurring opinion, Justice John Roberts wrote that the government's position "asks us to embrace a theory of the First Amendment that would allow censorship not only of television and radio broadcasts, but of pamphlets, posters, the Internet, and virtually any other medium that corporations and unions might find useful in expressing their views on matters of public concern." So, right off the bat, we are talking about pamphlets directly funded by corporations or labor unions. That's a big qualifier left out of Sessions' comment. And Sessions' point is further muddled when he drops in the example of Thomas Paine's pamphlet Common Sense, -- which in 1776 argued for American independence from British rule. Paine's 48-page pamphlet was not corporate-financed, so it's technically not applicable in this discussion. And it might not have been even if it was. "Solicitor Kagan was arguing that, under the Federal Election Campaign Act, corporate funds could not be used to publish a pamphlet that expressly advocated the election or defeat of a specific candidate for federal office," said Brett Kappel, an attorney specializing in ethics and lobbying law at the Washington, D.C.-based law firm Arent Fox. "The Act would not have prevented Thomas Paine from publishing Common Sense since that famous pamphlet had nothing to do with candidates running for office. Today it would be considered an issue ad, not an electioneering communication." The Federal Election Commission doesn't regulate advertising unless it includes the name or image of a candidate for federal office, Kappel noted. Others argue that whether Common Sense was technically not corporate-financed is not the issue. "Common Sense itself was probably not published by a corporation, but in today's world, it surely would have been," said Bradley A. Smith, Professor of Law at Capital University Law School. "How many such efforts can you name that are not?" The statement by Sessions "was a bit of rhetorical excess, perhaps," said Sean Parnell, president of the Center for Competitive Politics, a campaign-finance advocacy group. Obviously, he said, Sessions could have added a good bit of context. Kagan never argued that the government could ban any pamphlet. Nonetheless, Parnell said, in the context of limited corporate-financed political messages, Sessions' comment accurately described Kagan's position that in addition to a video, the government could ban a pamphlet. During some close questioning by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, on the Citizens United issue on the second day of the confirmation hearing, Kagan quickly framed the limits of the issue, stating that the statute ''applies only to corporations and unions when they make independent expenditures, not to their PACs ... within a certain period of an election." She also noted that as solicitor general, she was defending the statute as written by Congress, which "made the determination broadly that corporations and trade unions had this corrupting influence on Congress." "And the statute as it was written applies to pamphlets as well as to the movie in the case, and we made a vigorous argument that the application of that statute to any kind of classic electioneering materials, not books -- because they aren't typically used to electioneer -- but that the application of the statutes to any kinds of classic electioneering materials was in fact constitutional and that the court should defer to Congress' view of the need for this," Kagan said. Given the time constraints on opening statements, we are willing to allow Sessions a bit of rhetorical leeway. Kagan did argue that pamphlets should be included in the types of communication the government could prohibit. But again, that's in the context of pamphlets paid for directly by corporations or labor unions making independent expenditures (not through their PAC) for a pamphlet advocating for a specific candidate within the last months of an election. That's an awful lot of limiting context left out. And the point is further muddled by using the example of Paine's Common Sense. It's not at all clear that that pamphlet would have fallen under the regulation of the McCain-Feingold Act. And so we rate Sessions' comment Half True.

pomt-15146	"Of the 25 wealthiest nations, we're the only one that doesn't provide basic health coverage."	true	/virginia/statements/2015/sep/01/dan-gecker/dan-gecker-says-us-only-wealth-nation-without-univ/	When it comes to health care, state Senate hopeful Dan Gecker says the U.S. is in a dubious league of its own. "Of the 25 wealthiest nations, we’re the only one that doesn’t provide basic health coverage," Gecker, a Democrat who serves on the Chesterfield County Board of Supervisors, said during an Aug. 18 candidates’ forum. Gecker is seeking the 10th District Senate seat that long has been held by Republican John Watkins, who is not seeking re-election. Also running is Glen Sturtevant, a Republican who serves on the Richmond School Board; Marleen Durfee, an independent who is a former Chesterfield supervisor; and Carl Loser, a Libertarian from Powhatan County. Gecker, in his comment, was referring to universal coverage, in which all citizens get national help in paying for health costs. We wondered if he was right about about the United States’ exceptional status among the wealthiest nations. Gecker pointed us to a report last year issued by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of 34 nations -- mostly with industrialized economies -- seeking to improve trade. The report says only two OECD countries -- the U.S. and Mexico -- do not offer universal care. A chart in the study shows that all of the other OECD nations provide coverage for more than 90 percent of their people.. The roster of OECD nations, however, does not translate to a list of the 25 wealthiest countries. Gecker also directed us to the World Bank’s ranking of the wealthiest nations based on each country’s gross domestic product divided by its population -- a figure called GDP per capita. About two-thirds of the nations on the World Bank’s 25-richest list belong to the OECD. We sought to compare that ranking with a list of all nations that provide universal health care. We found two organizations that try to keep tabs on nations that provide universal coverage. One is the New York State Department of Health, which compiled a 2011 list to give medical providers guidance on billing practices when they treat foreign patients. The other resource is a 2010 study by researchers in the United Kingdom and the U.S. examining universal health care around the world. Among high GDP-per-capita nations, universal care coverage is the norm. Only three of the 25 wealthiest -- the U.S., Saudi Arabia and Qatar -- weren’t listed as having universal health care. The embassy for Qatar told us that the country does provide universal health care. Saudi Arabia is listed as providing universal health care in a June 28, 2012, story from The Atlantic magazine. We reached out to the Saudi Arabian embassy several times to confirm that’s the case, but did not hear back. A 1998 study published in the Journal of Family Community Medicine says "Saudi Arabian policy is to provide free, comprehensive and universal health care services to all citizens." The final source Gecker cited is a 2012 op-ed by David de Ferranti, former vice president of the World Bank, and Julio Frenk, the former dean of the Harvard School of Public Health, about universal health care coverage. "Except for the United States, the 25 wealthiest nations have some form of it (universal coverage)," de Ferranti and Frenk wrote in their op-ed. We got a similar take from two other health care analysts we contacted. Andrea Feigl, a visiting scientist at Harvard who co-wrote the 2010 U.K.-U.S. report, told us in an email that "The United States is still on its way towards UHC (Universal Health Coverage), and it is the last developed country to do so." The World Health Organization said in a September 2014 report that the United States is "currently the only high-income country without nearly universal health-care coverage." Our ruling Gecker said that "of the 25 wealthiest nations, we’re the only one that doesn’t provide basic health coverage." Gecker was referring to rich nations that provide coverage to all of their citizens. We can’t say definitively that the U.S. is the only one that doesn’t provide universal coverage, but evidence strongly points that way. So we rate his statement True.

pomt-01696	Says Rick Scott "is letting Duke (Energy) keep collecting billions" despite troubled power plants.	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/aug/13/nextgen-climate/pac-accuses-rick-scott-letting-duke-energy-fleece-/	Gov. Rick Scott has a new enemy on the campaign trail: Billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer. And Steyer has started bringing his message and massive checkbook to the airwaves. In an Aug. 8, 2014, commercial from Steyer’s political action committee NextGen Climate, the group accused the Republican incumbent of letting utility company Duke Energy run wild on the state’s citizens. The ad references the botched upgrade at the now-shuttered Crystal River nuclear plant and canceled Levy County nuclear project. "We Floridians are paying billions to the nation's largest power company and getting nothing in return," says a TV reporter. Then the narrator: "One defective power plant. Another never built. Florida fleeced by Duke Energy. Rick Scott knew, but he’s letting Duke keep collecting billions anyway." The ad flashes a statement attributed to the Tampa Bay Times: "Duke’s customers on the hook for up to $3.2 billion." It also says Scott received $500,000 in campaign contributions from Duke and its pre-merger counterpart, Progress Energy, strongly implying a connection. The commercial was one of two NextGen Climate ads released attacking Scott. The other accused Scott of accepting campaign contributions from a Texas company performing unauthorized oil drilling in Collier County. We looked at that one in a separate item. It’s obvious Scott heard of the troubles in Citrus and Levy counties, since it was a major headache for the 1.7 million Florida residents billed by Duke Energy for electricity (the company said it doesn’t comment on political ads). But we wondered, is there something Scott could have done to prevent the utility from pulling in billions for the troubled projects, even though no customer is benefitting from them? PolitiFact Florida decided to check the fine print. The nuclear option The saga of Duke Energy’s ill-fated nuclear plants on Florida’s west coast is complex, making it hard to comprehensively explain its ups and downs. (The Tampa Bay Times has extensively covered the morass.) We will give you a quick overview, though: In 2006, the state Legislature overwhelmingly passed SB 888, allowing utilities to charge a so-called "advance fee" to customers in order to pay for nuclear projects. The fee was based on the number of kilowatt hours the customers used, and shifted the expense of new nuclear projects to customers instead of shareholders. Unfortunately, while the bill allowed utilities to collect the fee for facilities yet to be built, there was no language included to ensure those companies had to actually build anything. That same year, Progress Energy began selecting a site in Levy County for a new nuclear power plant. Over the years, the potential cost of the project neared $25 billion, and Progress collected roughly $1 billion in advance fees to help pay for it. In 2009, Progress Energy was also upgrading its Crystal River nuclear plant by installing new steam generators. Progress elected to perform the upgrade itself and the reactor containment dome contracted during the project, requiring extensive repairs. Progress planned to reopen the plant in 2011, but the company committed one mistake after another in the work. Estimates to repair the building reached as high as $3.4 billion. Progress merged with Duke Energy in 2012. State lawmakers changed their tune about the advance fee in 2013 amending the 2006 law with SB 1472, saying a utility has 10 years after it gets its federal license to begin construction or lose access to the fees. The projects also had to be "reasonable," an important addition, considering the Levy project had turned into the most expensive nuclear power plant in U.S. history. The same day lawmakers passed the amendment by a wide margin, the Florida Supreme Court rejected an environmental group’s challenge to the fee, saying the 2006 fee was constitutional and the state’s Public Service Commission had a framework with which to apply it. Duke then decided in 2013 to shut down the Crystal River plant rather than fix it, even after using $265 million in advance fee money. The total cost of the Crystal River project grew to about $1.7 billion from repair work, having to buy electricity for customers elsewhere and other expenses. The company also canceled the Levy County project after spending $1.5 billion on it. Duke continued to clamor for more advance fee cash, saying it may one day continue the Levy County project or build a natural gas plant. They also claimed decommissioning the Crystal River facility would take 60 years and cost another $1.18 billion, much of which the utility collected for its federally required decommissioning fund. The five-member Public Service Commission voted 4-1 in October 2013 to settle with Duke Energy over $5 billion in costs for the two doomed projects. Customers would shoulder $3.2 billion in expenses, insurance would pay $835 million and shareholders would pay the rest, with Duke keeping about $250 million ($150 million for Levy, $100 million for Crystal River). Customers will have to pay monthly charges of $3.45 per 1,000 kilowatt hours for Levy through the early part of 2016 and $2.17 for Crystal River through at least 2017 -- all for two projects that never produced any electricity in exchange for the money paid. Who’s to blame? The commission’s members are appointed by the governor, who relies on the Legislature to draft a list of nominees when members’ four-year terms are up. Of the five veteran members on the board under Scott, four were previously chosen by Gov. Charlie Crist, and one was originally picked by Gov. Jeb Bush. Scott reappointed each, and the Legislature confirmed them. "Like judges appointed by the governor to the judiciary, PSC commissioners make independent decisions based on the established evidentiary record for each case," spokesperson Cindy Muir said. "PSC decisions are not reviewed by the Legislature or the governor." Scott did have some say on who served on the commission, however, although he has not spoken publicly about the two nuclear plants or the PSC’s vote. Scott could have urged lawmakers to deal with the advance fee, but no action was taken until 2013. Many lawmakers were still not pleased with the commission’s settlement. Rep. Dwight Dudley, D-St. Petersburg, called the 2013 changes to the fee "total eyewash" and several legislators demanded a complete repeal of the advance fee. That hasn’t happened. A change in the law is the only way consumers could avoid the advance fee, and that’s not up to the PSC or the governor alone, according to Public Counsel J.R. Kelly. "Whether the governor likes it or not and, to a certain extent, whether the PSC likes it or not, they have to follow the law," Kelly said. "I don’t know what the governor’s office or anyone else could have done." He pointed out that whether or not the governor and the commissioners share opinions on subjects, the PSC’s board members are appointed to four-year terms in order to avoid political reprisals after making unpopular decisions. Commissioners can only be removed for malfeasance, he said. Our ruling NextGen Climate said Scott "is letting Duke (Energy) keep collecting billions" after the utility company took in billions for two failed nuclear projects. The $3.2 billion settlement was the decision of the Public Service Commission, however, and not the governor or the Legislature. Scott and lawmakers have a say in who serves as commissioners, but the board’s decisions in utility matters is final. Scott could have asked for a change in the advance fee from 2006 that led to the flap, but he didn’t. He also could have appointed commissioners who may have voted differently. Beyond that, there’s not much the governor could do about the settlement the PSC awarded Duke. But it’s not like Scott has spoken up on the issue. If anything, he has been notably silent. We rate the statement Half True.	None	NextGen Climate	None	None	None	2014-08-13T11:33:44	2014-08-08	['None']
pomt-08511	Says Peter Kilmartin voted "in favor of expanding the 'good behavior' statute to sex offenders."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2010/oct/07/erik-wallin/wallin-says-kilmartin-voted-expand-good-behavior-l/	There are few things that scare the public more than the possibility of sex offenders running loose on the streets. So when Republican candidate for attorney general Erik Wallin issued a news release warning voters that his opponent, Democrat Peter Kilmartin, voted to allow sex offenders to shave time off their prison sentences for good behavior, it caught our attention. His claim began like this: "Erik Wallin, candidate for Attorney General, today criticized Representative Kilmartin for his vote in favor of expanding the 'good behavior' statute to sex offenders and called for its overall repeal for those who commit violent felonies (including sex crimes) and domestic violence offenses." He repeated much of that accusation in a subsequent appearance on WPRO 630-AM's "John DePetro Show." The good behavior statute he's talking about is part of a state law that dictates when and how prison inmates are allowed to earn time off their sentences. He is referring to a change in that policy enacted by lawmakers in 2008. But let's go back to what the law said before that rewrite. Since 1976, the statute has allowed well-behaved prison inmates -- except those serving life sentences -- to trim up to 10 days a month off their prison stays under a formula that was tied to the length of their sentence. For example, an inmate sentenced to eight years could knock eight days per month off his or her prison time, while someone serving five years could earn up to five days off a month. Prisoners could also earn small amounts of additional time off for what is known as meritorious service. Sex offenders were not excluded from those guidelines. Nor were violent felons or anyone else besides those with life sentences. In 2008, faced with cost concerns, crowding and calls for a good conduct policy that would allow those serving short sentences to earn as much time off as those imprisoned for more serious crimes, the state convened a panel to revamp the policy. That group was made up of prosecutors, public defenders, state police, the chief judge of the Superior Court, corrections officials and legislators. The result was a line item in Governor Carcieri's midyear budget that would have allowed all inmates except those serving life sentences to earn up to 10 days per month off their time -- a full third -- regardless of their crimes. The proposal also allowed inmates to earn up to five days more per month off for participating in rehabilitation programs such as substance-abuse treatment and anger management. House leaders later decided to consider the measure as a separate bill, rather than a budget item. (It is worth noting that as the House whip, Kilmartin was a member of that leadership team.) But as that bill made its way to the House floor, a small group of legislators on both sides of the aisle roared in protest. The new rules, they said, did not specifically exclude sex offenders, meaning they too were eligible for the increased good behavior benefits. House lawmakers rewrote the bill to specifically exclude sex offenders from benefiting from the new policy. In other words, they were still governed by the less generous statute from the 1970s. The legislation passed March 27, 2008, with Kilmartin voting yes. For procedural reasons, it found its way back into the midyear budget bill. It passed, complete with the language excluding sex offenders, in May of that year. Kilmartin again voted yes. But neither of his two votes that year gave any new privileges to sex offenders, as Wallin suggests. In fact, they did exactly the opposite, targeting sex offenders as the only inmates -- along with those serving life sentences -- who could not benefit. "Basically every other inmate at the [Adult Correctional Institutions] got a real benefit from this change, and the sex offenders did not," said Patricia Coyne-Fague, chief legal council for the state Department of Corrections. So why did Wallin accuse Kilmartin of a vote the representative never made? Wallin acknowledged that the new rules excluded sex offenders, and he said his initial new release contained "bad wording," noting that he sent out a subsequent statement that downplayed the sex offender side of what he said. In retrospect, Wallin said the essence of his claim had more to do with what Kilmartin didn't do than what he did. "My argument is simply that [Kilmartin] voted for a bill that continues to allow sex offenders to get credit for good behavior ... He failed to close the loophole," or repeal the older portion of the law that rewards sex offenders. Wallin is right about that. Sex offenders are still eligible to trim time off their sentences under a policy that some voters might not approve of. But that is the result of a law that passed in 1976, when Kilmartin was 14 years old. It had nothing to do with the 2008 votes. The claim stops short of receiving a Pants on Fire because Wallin acknowledges that the news release was poorly worded. But that doesn't change the fact that he accused his opponent of voting in favor of something he didn't vote for. We find this claim False.

pomt-14925	My campaign "finished the last quarter reporting the most cash on hand of any Republican in the field … $13.8 million in the bank, $3.5 million more than the Jeb Bush campaign."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2015/oct/30/ted-cruz/ted-cruz/	Ted Cruz of Texas recently declared that his campaign’s fundraising is "astonishing" and suggested that’s a surprise to the "Washington chattering class" and maybe even former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, another Republican bidding for president. Sen. Cruz, appearing in Houston Oct. 26, 2015, to accept endorsements from statewide elected Republicans including Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, celebrated how much he’s raised in Texas and in general. He made us wonder with mention of the Texas-born Bush, who’s trying to become the third member of his family to win the White House. Cruz said: "And we finished the last quarter reporting the most cash on hand of any Republican in the field… $13.8 million in the bank, $3.5 million more than the Jeb Bush campaign." Cruz added that if he’d predicted such an outcome relative to Bush six months before, reporters would have laughed aloud. Early in 2015, Bush drew headlines for raising money at a vigorous clip. No giggling here. But was Cruz right about his campaign having the biggest pile of cash on hand and exceeding Bush’s balance by $3.5 million? Campaign vs. campaign, you bet your cacti. But throw in money raised by PACs and Super PACs devoted to individual candidates and it could be there’s far more money stowed away to boost Bush. Then again, PAC fundraising updates won’t be filed until 2016. Campaign vs. campaign To our inquiry, Cruz campaign spokeswoman Catherine Frazier emailed us a list indicating that Cruz’s campaign ended the year’s third quarter, June through September 2015, with more cash on hand than any other Republican aspirant. Separately, we fetched a Federal Election Commission summary, dated Oct. 19, 2015, stating that through September 2015, Cruz’s campaign had nearly $13.8 million cash on hand. And Cruz’s balance, according to the document, exceeded the cash on hand of any of 15 other listed current or former Republican presidential candidates. At No. 2, retired surgeon Ben Carson had nearly $11.3 million cash on hand, according to the summary, followed by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio with nearly $11 million and Bush with nearly $10.3 million. To be precise, per Cruz’s claim in Houston, Bush’s cash on hand of $10,271,129 was a little more than $3.5 million less than Cruz’s $13,778,904. We’re not saying here that Cruz outraised everyone. According to another FEC summary, also dated Oct. 19, 2015, Carson raised some $31 million through September 2015, outpacing Cruz’s nearly $27 million and Bush’s nearly $25 million. Businessman Donald Trump, who has led many Republican voter polls, reported a scant $254,773 cash on hand through the third quarter. But Trump, who's wealthy, also has declared plans to self-fund his candidacy. Maybe how much cash he has on hand isn’t significant. Also, Politico noted Oct. 15, 2015, Trump fielded about $3.7 million in donations in the third quarter. Notably too, Democratic presidential hopefuls Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders each ended the quarter having raised more money and also having more cash on hand than any Republican. Clinton, the former first lady, senator and secretary of state, had nearly $33 million on hand, according to the FEC, and Sanders, a Vermont senator, had $27.1 million. PACs and Super PACs There’s another wrinkle if you consider how much money PACs and Super PACs devoted to candidates may have in cash on hand. According to a chart built by the New York Times, last updated Oct. 16, 2015, Bush-backing PACs and Super PACs had $98.2 million cash on hand through June 2015. In contrast, Cruz PACs and Super PACs had $37.5 million cash on hand. We don’t see a path to more recent balances; a footnote to the Times chart says most of these groups aren’t required to file an updated report until Jan. 31, 2016. Separately, the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign spending, posted a chart in October 2015 showing Bush PACs and Super PACs fielding far more money than any other hopeful, again with information limited to what such groups had reported through June 2015: SOURCE: Web post, "Behind the Candidates: Campaign Committees and Outside Groups," Center for Responsive Politics, last updated Oct. 27, 2015 (accessed the same day) The chart is preceded by explanatory text: "The modern presidential campaign isn't a single organization. Yes, there's always an official campaign committee. But for every White House candidate, there is usually at least one super PAC or other outside organization devoted to getting him or her elected. These groups can solicit unlimited donations and later use them to pummel rivals – or, as seems to be the case this cycle, take on some of the duties traditionally handled by a campaign, such as organizing town hall meetings or doing voter outreach." The explanation continues: "Outside groups aren't allowed to coordinate with official campaign committees, but they're often run by friends and former staffers – even family members – of the candidate they're helping. Overall, as of the middle of 2015, single-candidate super PACs in the presidential race had raised more money than the candidates themselves. But that wasn't true among Democrats, whose potential nominees raised more than the super PACs supporting them." Frazier of Cruz’s camp agreed by email it could be that money accumulated to promote Bush’s candidacy still runs ahead of funds raised for Cruz’s cause. Regardless, she reminded, Cruz limited his Houston claim to funds raised by campaigns alone. Our ruling Cruz said his campaign "finished the last quarter reporting the most cash on hand of any Republican in the field… $13.8 million in the bank, three and a half million dollars more than the Jeb Bush campaign." This is all so, though Bush still might remain ahead (perhaps way ahead) in money accumulated on behalf of a Republican. We won’t know how much total cash has been stashed to help each candidate until PACs report again in 2016. We rate this claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-09515	"In the three months before the act took effect, America lost 750,000 jobs a month. In the last three months, we've lost about 35,000 jobs a month."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/17/joe-biden/biden-says-job-losses-have-fallen-750000-month-350/	The stimulus bill is one year old. To celebrate its anniversary, administration officials are touting its successes. Vice President Joe Biden is among those talking up the bill. In a USA Today op-ed, he wrote that the success of the stimulus legislation, formally known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, can be measured by the number of jobs it has created. "We think the Recovery Act is working because of the progress we've made in slowing job loss," Biden wrote on Feb. 17, 2010, exactly a year since the stimulus bill was signed by President Barack Obama. "In the three months before the act took effect, America lost 750,000 jobs a month. In the last three months, we've lost about 35,000 jobs a month. That's progress — not good enough, not where we need to be, but progress. And most economists agree that that progress is thanks in a very large part to the Recovery Act." For this item, we'll focus on whether Biden is correct that America lost 750,000 jobs a month before the stimulus bill went into effect and only 35,000 a month in the last three months. Jay Carney, Biden's communications director, said that the numbers cited in the op-ed came from monthly job losses reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in January, February and March of 2009, as well as the last three months. On average, the economy lost about 752,000 jobs per month in the first three months of 2009, which is close to the 750,000 that Biden wrote in his op-ed. But Biden specifically wrote that job losses averaged that amount "in the three months before the act took effect," which was officially Feb. 17, 2009, the day the bill was signed. So, that time frame includes November and December of 2008, and January 2009. For that time period, the average was about 726,000 jobs. So, when it comes to job loss averages in the months before the stimulus bill officially went into effect, Biden is off by about 26,000 jobs. Carney said that the stimulus bill had very little effect on the economy until April 2009, so that's why they included March in their calculations. Next, we turned to average job losses for the last three months. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has not published data for February yet, so we focused on November and December of 2009, and January 2010. In this case, Biden is spot on: The average number of job losses over the last three months has been about 35,000. Whether the stimulus is entirely responsible for slowing job losses is a matter of opinion, and the subject of heated debate between conservative and liberal economists. Brian Riedl, a budget expert with the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that knowing whether the bill has helped stem job losses requires knowing how the economy would have performed had the stimulus bill never been put into law. He argues that the economy may have actually lost jobs as a result of the stimulus bill. For every job that's created through government spending, the government has to take money away from another part of the economy, which can produce job losses, he said. "At best, it's a zero-sum game." Jim Horney, director of federal fiscal policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, says that it's difficult to say exactly how many jobs have been created by the stimulus. "You can't look at a job and say, 'This job would not have been here without the stimulus.'" But you can measure the stimulus bill's impact on employment by looking at aggregate demand, Horney added. People have been buying more groceries, clothes and other goods, which indicates a stabilizing job market. So, back to Biden's claim. He said that job losses averaged about 750,000 in the three months before the stimulus bill went into effect. Including job loss statistics for the month of March 2009, Biden is correct. But the bill was signed Feb. 17, 2009, and officially went into effect that day. And using that measure — November and December of 2008, and January 2009 — Biden is off by about 26,000 jobs. Biden also said that job losses averaged about 35,000 for November and December 2009, and January of 2010, which is also correct. Because Biden is not quite right on the first part of his statement, we'll knock him down a point. As a result, we find his claim to be Mostly True.

pomt-07640	"Put simply, less government spending equals more private sector jobs."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2011/mar/16/eric-cantor/eric-spending-says-less-government-spending-equals/	Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Va., has focused on two topics since becoming House majority leader in January: spending and jobs. He linked the two in a March 4 news release. "To put it simply: less government spending equals more private sector jobs." We set out to see if economists -- and past economic data -- agree with Cantor, who returned to this theme in a March 15 press conference with other Republicans. First we looked for occasions where government spending has decreased. There have been three since World War II: At the end of that war, with government spending falling in the 1946, 1947 and 1948 fiscal years. During the Korean War, followed by a drop of 6.9 percent in 1954 and a further decline of 3.4 percent the following year. From 1964 to 1965, with spending falling 0.25 percent. That a large decrease came after World War II should come as little surprise, as government spending went from $9.14 billion in 1939 to $92.71 billion in 1945, with the American government essentially funding most of the global war effort against Germany and Japan. As the U.S. economy returned to peacetime status, government spending fell by 40.4 percent in the 1946 fiscal year, 37.5 percent the next year and 13.7 percent the year after that. Comparing spending data to job data is tricky, in part because the Treasury Department, which tracks spending and Gross Domestic Product, operates on a fiscal year that runs from Oct. 1 until Sept. 30. Before 1976 the fiscal year ran July 1 through June 30. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, by contrast, operates on calendar years. In 1946 private sector employment soared, driven by millions of veterans who came home, left the military and returned to former jobs or took new ones. Strong employment growth continued in 1947 before tailing off in 1948. But again, these changes reflected far more than a cut in government spending. The American economy was far and away the world’s strongest after the war, with much of Europe’s industrial capacity ruined by six years of terrible devastation. What about the mid-1950s? Government spending fell during two consecutive fiscal years. Private sector jobs dropped in 1954 by 585,000, grew by 2.3 million in 1955 and then climbed by 673,000 in 1956. In the final case the U.S. economy added more than 2 million private sector jobs in both 1965 and 1966. Brian Riedl, a research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, suggested we also look at job expansion in years where government spending grew at a slower rate than GDP. In those years the government essentially becomes a smaller part of the overall economy. This occurred five times during the 1983 through 1988 fiscal years, and each year the economy had strong employment growth, adding more than 1.5 million jobs annually. In 1983 and 1984, more than 3.4 million annual jobs were added, though that was also a period when the United States was recovering from the severe recession of 1981 and 1982. GDP also grew faster than government spending between 1992 and 2000. The U.S. gained jobs each of those years, and in all but two of those years more than 2 million private sector jobs were added to the economy. The low point was 1992, when 915,000 new jobs were created. So again, large job growth has often happened during times when government spending was decreasing or growing slower than GDP. But several economists told us we should not confuse correlation -- the fact that these two things were happening at the same time -- with causation. Government spending has historically risen during times of recession, as Uncle Sam seeks to prop up the economy. And social programs such as unemployment insurance or food stamps cost more when more people are out of work. At the same time, tax revenue is falling because people who lose jobs pay far less income tax. Riedl, who said he strongly believes cutting government spending helps grow the private sector, noted that the positive impacts occur in the long-run, not the short-term. "When federal spending drops that leaves more money for the private sector," he said. "That’s a neutral effect. But over time the private sector is more likely to spend the money in [more] productive ways than the government, and to invest it better than the government." The Heritage economist said the lag time for these benefits depends on how the private sector spends any additional funds. Investments in new factories or research projects can take years to return profits to a company and the economy. Cantor’s staff said their claim was based in part on a blog post by John Taylor, an economist from Stanford University. Taylor has long argued against the stimulus spending. On his blog he disputes reports by Moody’s economist Mark Zandi that the $61 billion in spending cuts proposed by the House GOP would cost the economy 700,000 jobs over 2011 and 2012. Taylor said that if the government can produce a "credible" debt-reduction plan it should "increase economic growth and reduce unemployment by removing uncertainty and lowering the chances of large tax increases in the future." The removal of uncertainty would also stimulate higher investment spending -- on both employees and technology -- by American businesses, Taylor believes. His calls were echoed in a February 13 letter to President Barack Obama from about 150 economists. The letter said action should be taken to immediately "rein in federal spending." Cantor and other House Republicans are also citing a new report on government spending by Andrew Biggs, Kevin Hassett and Matt Jensen, scholars at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. The report, essentially an extended version of a Dec. 29, 2010 op-ed that ran in The Wall Street Journal, stated that cutting federal spending is the most efficient way to balance the budget and feed future economic growth. They claimed deficit reduction programs fail if they are too reliant on tax increases. Chris Edwards, director tax policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said the GOP is right to pursue spending cuts. But he said the argument that spending cuts would definitely create more private-sector jobs is rooted in political rhetoric, not economic fact. "I’m not sure talking about jobs is the way to go," Edwards said. "The unemployment rate has more to do with microeconomic factors" than federal spending plans. Edwards added that the U.S. budget deficit may be increasing uncertainty and making businesses more cautious about hiring, but he said it is virtually impossible to quantify the size of this impact. Not all economists are convinced the cuts will have a positive impact on jobs. Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Brookings Institution, said the short-term impact of a spending cut is usually negative. Consider, for example, the $61 billion cut proposed by House Republicans for the current fiscal year. If approved, Burtless said, government agencies might find themselves cutting back on contracts with private companies. Those companies, having less business, might then need to lay off employees to maintain their profits. "Let’s say a cut to the defense procurement budget leads to a loss of 300,000 defense industry jobs," Burtless said by way of example. "To have any benefit, we now need to add 300,000 jobs to replace the lost ones, then add more." Stressing that he does not think the long-term benefits match up to Cantor’s claim, Burtless said that even if it is true, the private sector makes hiring decisions based on economic demand or the need to increase production. The only way to reduce unemployment, he added, is for product demand to increase. Let’s review. Cantor says "less government spending equals more private sector jobs." His staff cites letters and articles by a group of economists. Total federal spending has only decreased a few times in the past 70 years, and the only large drops came at the end of World War II and the Korean War. Private sector jobs increased after both of those wars, but the gains were driven by many factors, including the return to a peace-time economy and the demobilization of millions of soldiers, many of whom went directly into the private work force. During larges stretches of the 1980s and 1990s government spending grew at a slower rate than the overall economy, and large job growth occurred. But economists warned us there is a not a direct link between spending policies and job policies. Cantor may be right with his prescription of lower spending to spur higher job growth. But he goes too far when he asserts a cut equals more private sector jobs. No one knows for sure. The congressman is presenting an economic theory as established fact. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-01244	"Proximity to high-voltage power lines lowers property values by as much as 30 percent."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/nov/16/friends-india-point-park/india-point-park-group-says-proximity-large-power-/	For more than a decade, residents and officials from Providence and East Providence have lobbied to have the high-voltage power lines that traverse the waterfront along India Point Park buried. The latest estimate to complete the job is $33.9 million, with a 25 percent contingency fund, meaning costs could be as low as $25 million or as high as $42 million, according to figures made public by National Grid. The Friends of India Point Park, the group that has led the effort to move the power lines underground and take down the poles and towers that support them, argues that the project is worthwhile, primarily because it will remove what its members contend is a visual blight along the shores of East Providence and Providence. Burying the lines would improve the scenic beauty of the park and make the vacant land abutting it near Route 195 more marketable -- and more valuable, the group argues. "Proximity to high-voltage power lines lowers property values by as much as 30%," the group says on its website, adding that multiple studies bear this out. We were curious if there really is a negative effect on property values and, if there is, whether it’s that large. We called David Riley, the co-chairman of Friends of India Point Park, for more information. He sent us a lot of documents and references to back up the claim -- burying us in information, so to speak -- but we decided to start with a paper published in 2010 in the Journal of Real Estate Literature that is cited on his group’s website. That paper, written by a Texas A&M University professor and a colleague, reviewed more than a half-century of studies on the effects of electric transmission lines on property values. The studies included a 1992 survey of appraisers, with the majority of respondents saying that high-voltage power lines would lower the market value of a nearby property by 10 percent on average. They also included sales price analyses. Many were inconclusive or failed to quantify an effect. One 1979 model predicted a 6-percent decrease for homes between 50 and 200 feet of power lines. Another 1995 study said the effect was a drop in value of less than 5 percent and another done in 2002 in an area near Montreal put it at 9.6 percent on average. None mentioned a decrease of 30 percent. "The studies reviewed, while having some inconsistencies in their detailed results, generally pointed to small or no effects on sales price due to the presence of electric transmission lines," the authors said. That didn’t sound like it supported the Providence group’s claim. So we looked at what Riley sent us. His documents included a summary on the previously cited Montreal study that described the negative price effect as "ranging from 5% to well in excess of 20%." We got a copy of that 2002 study. Although it said that the average decrease was smaller, it did find a 21-percent decrease in residential sales prices for an area of homes within 50 feet of high-voltage power lines. We found separate studies in Canada carried out in relation to a power line outside Vancouver that found negative price effects of up to 27 percent for homes in close proximity, according to a report on a transmission line proposal in Alberta. Riley also sent us part of a report on property values near a power line outside of Houston. That 1993 report found that assessed values of properties abutting the easement for the power line were up to 31 percent less than those farther away. And he sent an excerpt from a 2012 report on sales in Montana that found a decrease in the values of homes in a subdivision near a transmission line of 25 percent to 30 percent. Lastly, we found two references (here and here) to a study in Quebec that found that values of second home lots near a high-voltage power line along recreational land were up to 34 percent lower than expected. (Because the study is in French -- and our last French class was in high school -- we were reliant on secondary sources that summarized it.) We called Providence-based real estate appraiser Tom Andolfo, who has chaired the Rhode Island chapters of the Appraisal Institute and the Real Estate Appraisers Board, to get his view. In testimony before state regulators in 1994 on removing the power lines that cross from East Providence to Providence, he cited the 31 percent number from the Houston study. He told us, however, that he believes the actual effect is not as large. "A realistic figure could be from 5 to 15 percent," he said. But Riley said he believes that because the power lines running across East Providence and Providence are on the water, the effect on property values would likely be at the upper range of figures cited in the studies. "It … seems logical to me that power lines obstructing water views will likely depress property values more than wires in front of, say, buildings, because they'll be more conspicuous and obstructing a more pleasant, valued view that owners are paying for," he told us. Our ruling The Friends of India Point Park says that proximity to high-voltage power lines lowers property values by as much as 30 percent. There are many studies on the effects of power lines on property values. Nearly all of the ones that we found determined that there was a negative effect on values. But they differ widely in what that effect actually is. Most put it at less than 10 percent. But we found four studies in the United States and Canada that found decreases that ranged from close to 30 percent to more than 30 percent. They appeared to be isolated cases, but they did occur, according to the studies. The Friends of India Point Park does not say that such a price effect is the norm. The group only says that a decrease in value can be as much as 30 percent. Riley says that language was chosen on purpose. (There’s also some question about what the group means by "proximity) but we won’t get into that here.) Because the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details -- the preponderance of studies showing property value decreases of 10 percent or less -- we rate it Half True.

pomt-08816	This year, Newt Gingrich "has raised as much money as Mitt Romney, Tim Pawlenty, Sarah Palin, and Mike Huckabee combined."	true	/georgia/statements/2010/aug/15/esquire-magazine/magazine-says-newt-gingrich-leads-fundraising/	Twelve years after he resigned amid Republican Party defeats and ethics troubles, former longtime Georgia Congressman Newt Gingrich is "ascendant," a recent Esquire magazine article reported. Gingrich, who gained renown for helping orchestrate the historic 1994 Republican takeover of Congress, has managed to maintain his position as the party's philosopher king, according to "Newt Gingrich: The Indispensable Republican" a profile by John H. Richardson. This accomplishment may have produced real political gains. Although Gingrich has not said he is running, he is an early leader in polling for the 2012 presidential election, the article said. Plus, he's trouncing the competition in the thing that matters most in contemporary politics: raising cash. This year, Gingrich "has raised as much money as Mitt Romney, Tim Pawlenty, Sarah Palin, and Mike Huckabee combined," the article states. Is he really beating all of them? Even Palin? Granted, the 2012 race is far from beginning in earnest, and Gingrich's real chances are unclear. Thanks in part to his conservative fan base, his name comes up regularly as a possible presidential contender, but he has yet to commit. Still, his fundraising is well worth a look. Even though it's not clear whether Gingrich plans to run for president, federal law allows him to operate a "527 group," a type of political organization capable of raising massive amounts of money. His American Solutions for Winning the Future raised the cash mentioned in the Esquire article. It describes itself as "a unique tri-partisan organization designed to rise above traditional gridlocked partisanship, to provide real, significant solutions to the most important issues facing our country." American Solutions has opposed stringent regulation of the energy industry and advocated for giving more leeway to school districts that want to fire mediocre teachers, among other things. One of Esquire's fact-checkers backed up the article's claim by pointing us to a page on the website of Media Matters for America,a liberal group that fact-checks claims by the media. It referenced articles about the fundraising efforts of various political action committees, or PACs, and American Solutions. They show that American Solution's haul dwarfed those of the PACs for potential political candidates. So what are PACs and 527 groups? We asked Paul Ryan,an attorney for the Campaign Legal Center,which advocates for campaign finance reform and strengthening federal ethics rules and enforcement. We also consulted Federal Election Commission rules and tax code. It's complicated, so bear with us. 527 groups are a type of nonprofit named after the section of federal tax code that outlines what they can do. They exist to raise money to get a candidate elected. Political action committees, or PACs, raise money to elect candidates, too. Many are also free from paying income tax under the same code that creates 527 groups. There are several types of PACs, and the kind that's controlled by candidates can't accept money directly from corporations or labor unions. They have strict donation limits that can be as small as $2,400 per individual. 527 groups such as Gingrich's try hard to avoid being regulated as a PAC, and that's a tricky business. A bunch of local, state and federal laws chime in on what it means to be a PAC, but if a 527 can avoid being pigeonholed, the payoff is big: Corporations and labor unions can give non-PAC 527 groups as much money as they choose and as often as they want. According to OpenSecrets.org, Newt Gingrich's 527 received $350,000 from a single corporate donor during the 2010 election cycle. Politicians interested in running for major offices find it useful to start 527s or PACs to lay the groundwork for their campaigns. They help them exert influence over issues or races. Which one they start depends on how they want to spend. Yes, 527s can raise far more money, but PACs can do things that 527s can't. For instance, by law, current federal officeholders have to play by PAC rules when they raise funds. And it's easier for a PAC to give money to a specific candidate. So 527 groups and PACs are not the same thing, a fact that the Esquire article acknowledges, albeit imperfectly. It said that 527s are barred from promoting the interests of a specific candidate when, in fact, that's what they're all about. But a lot of them avoid contributing to candidates to duck being regulated under tougher PAC rules. Pawlenty, who is governor of Minnesota, does not have a 527 group, a PAC staffer confirmed. Press representatives of the other candidates did not respond to our requests for comment, and a Web search found no evidence that they currently have 527 groups either. Now it's time to examine the numbers. We looked up American Solutions' Internal Revenue Services filings, plus the FEC filings for the PACs of Huckabee, Palin, Pawlenty and Romney. By June 30, American Solutions had raised $6,081,984.00.The others had raised $6,015,422.33. Gingrich wins. Federal filings confirm that Gingrich has indeed raised more than the other candidates combined -- but with a very important caveat. Comparing 527 groups with PACs is not entirely fair because it's much easier for a 527 group to raise money. The Esquire article acknowledged the difference between PACs and 527 groups. And while it mixed up some details, it got right the overall point that they're hard to compare. Given that Esquire gave its statement adequate context, we rule this statement True.

pomt-12154	"We’re spending 18 percent of our GDP on healthcare while the average among industrialized countries is closer to 8 percent."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/aug/09/mike-gallagher/mike-gallagher-target-claim-health-care-costs-us-v/	Since his arrival in Congress in January 2017, first-term U.S. Rep. Mike Gallagher, (R-Green Bay) has gotten a crash course in health-care politics. When he was interviewed July 9, 2017, on "Upfront with Mike Gousha," a public affairs show that airs on WISN-TV (Channel 12), Gallagher reiterated his support for repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, but said the issues with health care in the U.S. are deeper than those the now-stalled House bill tried to address. "Whatever we’re doing right now with our health care system is not working," he said, later adding: "The biggest source of frustration for me, as a new member of Congress, is we’re having this debate over health insurance reform when, really, we need to turn to the drivers of health care costs in this country." Then he offered this statistic: "We’re spending 18 percent of our GDP on health care while the average among industrialized countries is closer to 8 percent." Is he right about the numbers? The numbers Gallagher drew his statistics from two reports, according to Madison Wiberg, his communications director. The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) tracks the nation’s expenditures on health care over time. Those numbers show the U.S. spent 17.8 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) on healthcare in 2015, the most recent year for which data is available. The 8 percent came from the amount the U.K. spent of its GDP in 2013 (actually 8.8 percent), according to Wiberg. That number came from a 2015 report from the Commonwealth Fund, a private foundation that aims to improve health care systems in industrialized nations through funding independent research. But Gallagher’s claim referenced the average of all industrialized nations, not just England. The average high-income nation actually spent 10.6 percent of its GDP on health care in 2015 according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation. That gap between the U.S. and other developed nations is longstanding and well-known. But the difference isn’t one that began with the passing or even the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, often termed Obamacare. Kaiser found that the gap between the U.S. and other high-income nations has been growing since about 1980. In the four decades since, the percentage of GDP in the U.S. spent on health care shot up from 6 percent (on par with other high-income countries at the time) to the 17.8 percent in 2015. In comparison, the Netherlands, the next highest spender, used 12 percent of its GDP on care. When spending is measured by person, the picture is not much different. At $9,451 per person, the U.S. spends almost twice the average for comparable countries, $4,908, according to data from the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD). For a while, the rate of growth was slowing, both in the U.S. and abroad. A 2015 report by The Commonwealth Fund listed the slowdown as a key finding and data from the 2017 annual National Health Spending report by the CMS showed the same slowdown from about 2003 to 2013. In 2014 and 2015, the major provisions of the ACA were implemented and CMS reported increases in spending growth comparable to periods of recession. The difference, according to the paper, was "from 2013 to 2015 the number of uninsured individuals fell by 15.0 million, and the insured share of the population reached 90.9 percent." In other words, the spending went up in part because more people were insured. More for our money? While it does not impact our rating, we thought we’d take a quick look at how the U.S. stacks up in terms of outcomes. According to most recent data from the OECD, American life expectancy at birth was 78.8 in 2015, the 9th lowest of 34 OECD nations (the data does not include Canada). In a 2013 report, "U.S. Health in International Perspective: Shorter Lives, Poorer Health," authors wrote that even Americans in advantaged demographics -- "white, insured, college-educated or upper income" -- have worse health outcomes than similar people abroad. The panel found that in addition to obesity and other lifestyle-related issues, Americans are worse off than their foreign counterparts with respect to drug use, HIV/AIDS, lung disease (even though other countries smoke more). The list goes on: Americans are dying of heart disease more often. They’re having limbs amputated due to diabetes complications more often. In two areas, the U.S. fared better -- Americans are less likely to die from cancer and received better end-of-life care. "Almost always, Americans were in poorer health," said Steven Woolf of Virginia Commonwealth University, who chaired the National Academies committee that did the report. The researchers identified five overlapping reasons for the discrepancy: a health system where people lack access to basic care and insurance coverage, behaviors such as alcohol abuse and overeating, social and economic conditions, physical environments (for instance, we drive more than we walk or bike), and public policies and social values that fail to consider health impacts. Our rating Gallagher said "We’re spending 18 percent of our GDP on health care while the average among industrialized countries is closer to 8 percent." His number for the U.S. spending is on target, but the one he uses for other industrialized nations is a bit low. That said, he’s right about his major point: The U.S. has long outspent industrialized nations on health care -- a trend that began long before the implementation of Obamacare. We rate Gallagher’s claim Mostly True. div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Mike Gallagher	None	None	None	2017-08-09T05:00:00	2017-07-09	['None']
pomt-01143	"A lot of what (Cuba’s) survival depends on is Venezuelan oil money, which is drying up."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/dec/18/ana-navarro/navarro-cubas-economy-survives-largely-venezuelan-/	President Barack Obama’s historic decision to open full diplomatic relations with Cuba has appalled many opponents of the Castro regime. Among their biggest complaints is that Cuba got huge concessions from the United States without being required to make fundamental changes to its political system. CNN contributor and Republican strategist Ana Navarro also argued that Obama could have outwaited the Castro brothers, Fidel and Raul. The Cuban economy is in shambles, Navarro told CNN’s Anderson Cooper. "A lot of what their survival depends on is Venezuelan oil money, which is drying up," Navarro said. "Now that we are so close to the end of those two dictators -- who have oppressed these people for over half a century -- now we're going to change and do it unilaterally without them lifting the oppression?" The Cuba-Venezuela connection has been on the lips of many commentators since the news broke. We thought it would be good to put a number to Venezuela’s generosity toward Cuba and to what extent that aid is a matter of life or death for the Cuban economy. Cuba and Venezuela have been joined at the hip in their shared antipathy toward the United States. The superpower to the north sees both governments as fundamentally opposed to political freedom and free markets. In return, leaders in Cuba and Venezuela regularly speak out against the United States. Out of this tension emerged a deal between Cuba and Venezuela. Cuba sent tens of thousands of medical staff and other skilled professionals to treat Venezuela’s poor and otherwise aid the government. In exchange, Venezuela sent Cuba oil and provided money to modernize that country’s infrastructure. The plunging price of oil has put the basic tenets of that swap in jeopardy, experts say. Cuba’s supply line We found estimates that Venezuela sends about 80,000 to 100,000 barrels of oil per day. Luis R. Luis is the former chief economist with the Organization of American States, an international body with representatives of governments that span from Canada to Argentina. Luis told PunditFact the swap means a lot to Cuba. "Venezuelan oil and transfers play a key role in allowing the country to import essential foodstuffs, medicines and industrial inputs," Luis said. "The value of oil plus investments and grants from Venezuela to Cuba varies greatly from year to year largely because of oil price fluctuations. In 2008 it was over 10 percent of GDP. Last year some 6 percent of GDP. This year less." Former International Monetary Fund economist Ernesto Hernandez-Cata offered a slightly higher estimate of "just over $7 billion, or 11 percent of Cuba’s GDP," in 2011. Whatever the exact percentage, and even though the aid has been falling, Venezuela pulls a lot of weight in the Cuban economy. University of Maryland economist Roger Betancourt said that impact only grows when you factor in trade between the two nations. Betancourt, who co-founded the Association for the Study of the Cuban Economy, said Venezuela accounts for about 40 percent of Cuba’s trade in goods. We found another estimate that put Venezuelan purchases at 20 percent of Cuba’s GDP. Why would Venezuela stop helping Cuba? Venezuela has seen the price it receives for sending oil overseas fall 40 percent this year because of the drop of oil prices worldwide. And oil revenues account for about 95 percent of the country's export earnings, according to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. As such, Venezuela faces an economic collapse that include defaulting on its debts. "You only need to look at the economic disaster that is Venezuela, and clearly it’s a bad bet to have all your chips in one basket," Christopher Sabatini, policy director at Council of the Americas, told Bloomberg. "That 100,000 barrels per day gift of oil is going to end very soon." Not a matter of life or death While the Venezuelan connection is hefty, its importance can be overblown. Hernandez-Cata ran the numbers and found that if the aid stopped, Cuba's real GDP would contract "somewhere between 7 percent and 10 percent" without Venezuelan oil. Which would be no garden party for Cuba, but as Hernandez-Cata noted, the country emerged from a fall of 38 percent in GDP when the USSR cut off its economic support in the early 1990s. And today, Cuba has been moving to diversify. "Current efforts to obtain financing at non-market terms from other countries, like Algeria, Angola and Brazil, would, if successful, diminish the magnitude of the shock," Hernandez-Cata wrote. A longtime critic of the Castro regime, Pedro A. Freyre, a partner in the law firm of Akerman LLP, is skeptical of the doom and gloom predictions of Cuba’s precarious economy. "Cuba has turned surviving misery into an art," Freyre said. "Cuba has been diminishing expectations for decades. Everything collapsed in 1992. It was a disaster and they survived." For the record, Freyre, who lost a brother-in-law in the failed U.S.-backed Bay of Pigs assault on Cuba in 1961, now favors normal diplomatic relations. Our ruling Navarro said a lot of Cuba’s survival depends on Venezuelan oil money, and that it's drying up. The data we found and the experts we reached back that up, to a point. Venezuelan aid added at least 6 percent to Cuba’s GDP last year. Venezuela is also a major trading partner, buying as much as 40 percent of Cuba’s trade in goods. The loss of direct support from Venezuela could cause a 7 to 10 percent drop in Cuba’s GDP, experts told us. While that hasn't happened yet, it's certainly a strong possibility. Though Cuba has been moving to reduce its dependency on Venezuela, and has a track record of making it through tough times, that would still be a significant hit. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-04903	Says the "largest tax increase in American history is set to occur on January 1st unless President Obama and Congress can come to an agreement."	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/aug/03/francisco-quico-canseco/quico-canseco-says-bush-cuts-expiring-would-cause-/	EDITOR’S NOTE: A reader emailed us to point out that we got one tax-cut option backwards in the next-to-last paragraph. Nobody’s considering giving tax cuts only to the wealthy; rather, one option is to extend the tax cuts for everyone but the wealthy. The tax increase figure is given correctly, though: Letting the tax cuts expire for the wealthy would translate to a tax increase of about 0.4 percent of GDP. We’ve corrected the sentence below, and it does not affect our calculations. U.S. Rep. Francisco "Quico" Canseco opened a recent email blast by saying that an historic tax surge has his attention. "As you may know," the San Antonio Republican wrote constituents, "the largest tax increase in American history is set to occur on January 1st unless President Obama and Congress can come to an agreement." His email also says the Republican-majority House would vote later that week on preventing the increases. Canseco was hardly the first advocate to declare that the tax hike would be record-setting. When the tax cuts put in place under President George W. Bush were last up for renewal in 2010, "largest ever" became a rallying cry of sorts for congressional Republicans and news entities alike. In a Fox News Sunday appearance that year, former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin made a similar claim. At the time, PolitiFact ruled her claim "Pants On Fire" because she was wrong about the ranking and incorrectly described the Democrats' plans. The tax-related figures haven’t changed much since. Estimates vary as to how much taxes would rise if the Bush-era tax cuts were allowed to expire without exceptions. Congress approved the tax breaks in 2001 through the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act, and adjusted them in 2003 through the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act. The tax cuts were set to expire in 2010, because they passed Congress through a procedure known as reconciliation, which only requires 50 votes in the Senate. But, after a heated debate, lawmakers voted in 2010 to extend them for two more years. Some tax analysts have argued that, because the tax cuts were intended to be temporary, their expiration does not count as a tax increase. We’re not getting into that argument here. Most estimates for the increase caused by repealing the tax cuts hover around $3.7 trillion over 10 years, the number represented in the Congressional Budget Office’s Budget and Economic outlook from January 2012. (The number is listed under the category of "extend certain income tax and estate and gift tax," though analysts assured PolitiFact New Hampshire that it refers to the Bush tax cuts). Another $900 billion increase would stem from keeping the Alternative Minimum Tax from socking more taxpayers. In raw dollars, then, the resulting $4.6 trillion total would rank among the greatest tax increases in history. By email, Canseco’s spokeswoman, Kyler Arnold, pointed out by email that the CBO said in January 2012 that the impact of not extending the Bush-originated tax cuts would be about $5 trillion. Table 1-6 in the report indicates that the cumulative costs of extending the tax cuts and steadying the Alternative Minimum Tax through 2023 would be $5.3 trillion, counting nearly $800 billion in debt service. But there’s a better way to compare the potential increase with tax increases through history. Economists do this by calculating tax increases as a percentage of the gross domestic product, or GDP. GDP means a country's entire annual economic economic output; it's a way of measuring the entire economy. If we calculate tax increases as a percentage of GDP, it means we don't have to worry about distortions from variables like inflation or economic growth. Spread over the next 10 years, the $4.6 trillion tax increase would amount to about 2.25 percent of the nation’s GDP. That figure, calculated with help from several tax analysts, starts from adding together the Budget Office’s projected GDP figures over the next 10 years, 2013-2022; then the total is divided by the $4.6 trillion figure. The result is higher than most tax increases in recent history, according to a 2006 U.S. Treasury report analyzing all tax measures since 1940. According to the report, the Bush tax cuts have held a higher percentage of the GDP than many of the biggest tax laws in recent history. It beats out the the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, which measured in at 1.23 percent of GDP by the time all its provisions went into effect in 1986. It also measures larger than the Revenue Act of 1941, which at $3.6 billion, amounted to 2.2 percent of GDP. Yet, according to the analysis, the Bush tax cuts fall well below the Revenue Act of 1942, which is estimated at 5.04 percent of GDP. That act passed into law after the United States entered World War II. And this would make the Bush tax cuts, should they expire, the second-largest tax increase in history, as a percentage of GDP. "There is no doubt, if all the (Bush) tax cuts were allowed to expire, this would have a very big impact," Howard Gleckman, an analyst at the Tax Policy Center, an independent tax analysis group, told PolitiFact New Hampshire. Gleckman, author of the blog TaxVox.org, continued: "But, if you’re asking the question, would it be the largest tax increase ever, the answer is no." By email, Arnold pointed out the 1942 tax increase included a 5 percent "Victory" income tax add-on that was repealed in 1944 "and never designed to be a permanent tax increase" while, she said, "the tax increase set to occur at the end of the year is a permanent tax increase, absent legislative action. Comparing a tax bill (including a temporary tax increase for the war) to a permanent tax increase is not apples to apples." We ran Arnold’s thought by Gleckman, who pointed out that when they passed into law, the Bush tax cuts had a built-in end date -- one since extended by Congress. Broadly, he said, all tax laws are temporary in that sense, though Bush’s cuts were explicitly temporary. Gleckman agreed that ending the Bush tax cuts would result in the biggest hike by the GDP gauge since 1942. However, he said, the difference between the No. 1 and speculated-about No. 2 tax increase, 2.25 percent of GDP versus 5 percent, is huge. "This is like saying the horse that came in second by 20 lengths almost won," he said by phone. Broadly, as Gleckman notes, few in Washington expect the Bush tax cuts to expire in full. Rather, the debate this year has centered on whether to extend the tax breaks for everyone or extend them for all but the nation’s highest earners. If only cuts for the most wealthy residents were allowed to expire, it would mean a tax increase of about 0.4 percent of GDP. Our ruling The trillions of dollars at stake with the expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts places them among the nation’s most costly. Still, the cuts, if allowed to expire, would amount to less than half the percentage of the gross domestic product reflected in the 1942 tax increase. We rate Canseco’s claim as Half True.

pomt-05594	"There is not one single federal housing program yet that has not needed a bailout to survive."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2012/mar/30/lynn-westmoreland/westmoreland-all-federal-housing-programs-need-bai/	U.S. Rep. Lynn Westmoreland thinks taxpayers may be dragged into the bailout business again, thanks to the Federal Housing Administration. The FHA provides mortgage insurance to encourage banks to write loans to people who have little cash for a down payment. Many of these loans went bad when the housing bubble burst, and FHA officials are trying to raise money to keep the insurance afloat. It’s not the first time, Westmoreland said during a Feb. 29 congressional hearing. "There’s not been one single federal housing program yet that has not needed a bailout to survive," Westmoreland said. All federal housing programs? We contacted a Westmoreland spokeswoman to get the story. Leslie Shedd, the spokeswoman, said Westmoreland was referring to three programs that were started to keep the housing market stable and encourage Americans to buy homes: Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the FHA. Here’s how the feds got involved in the housing market: After the real estate market collapsed during the Great Depression, the feds took steps to encourage banks to make home loans and families to buy houses. They created the FHA, which issues mortgage insurance to guarantee that banks will get their money back even if a homeowner doesn’t make payments. This encourages banks to approve mortgages for people who don’t have a lot of money or have mediocre credit. They also created Fannie Mae, and later Freddie Mac, to help lenders raise money to make more loans. Fannie and Freddie do this by selling the mortgages lenders’ make in bulk as securities and guaranteeing they will make a return. Other programs perform similar tasks. For instance, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, like the FHA, insures home loans, but only for houses in rural areas. The Office of Public and Indian Housing backs them for native lands, while the Department of Veterans Affairs guarantees them for veterans. Ginnie Mae, like Fannie and Freddie, guarantees mortgage securities, but its securities are made up of government-backed loans by the FHA, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and Public and Indian Housing. This is what our research found: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Fannie and Freddie were bailed out by taxpayers in 2008. But calling them "federal housing programs" is a thorny issue. They weren’t controlled by the government until the bailout. Congress chartered Fannie and Freddie as "government-sponsored enterprises," or GSEs. They are supposed to help the U.S. meet its housing policy goals, but they were designed as for-profit corporations with their own shareholders and boards of directors. The federal government explicitly said it did not back the GSEs’ securities. "They are in no way categorized as federal housing programs," said Ted Gayer, co-director of the economic studies program at the Brookings Institution. The feds estimate the bailout will cost between $220 billion and $311 billion through 2014, though some of that will be paid back. Federal Housing Administration The president’s proposed budget for 2013 says the U.S. Treasury might have to give the FHA $688 million in emergency funds, but whether help will come in the form of a taxpayer-funded bailout is uncertain. The FHA hiked the cost of mortgage insurance earlier this month to raise money, and it is set to receive about $1 billion from a legal settlement over fraudulent foreclosure practices. Its officials say these measures will avoid a bailout, but critics say this won’t be enough. Ginnie Mae Ginnie Mae hasn’t been bailed out, and it’s not clear it’s in dire trouble. A November 2011 General Accounting Office report found that higher-than-expected defaults could force Ginnie Mae to dip into its reserves. It also concluded that Ginnie should do better at predicting future costs and documenting its methods. But so far, Ginnie has taken in more money than it has spent, the GAO said. All the rest The remainder of the federal programs are smaller players in the mortgage markets. As of the second quarter of 2011, the FHA backed nearly $1 trillion in single-family loans. Veterans Affairs backed less than a quarter of that, while the USDA backed some 7 percent, according to data from the federal agency that took over Fannie and Freddie. They have yet to run into the kinds of trouble that Fannie, Freddie and the FHA are experiencing. The USDA and PIH have not needed a bailout so far, but Edward Pinto, a former Fannie Mae executive and scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, warns the USDA might need one, in part because it makes riskier loans. The FHA requires down payments of 3.5 percent. The USDA allows loans with no money down. As for Veterans Affairs, the word "bailout" does not apply. Whenever one of its loans defaults, taxpayers automatically pick up the tab. The program is not expected to pay for itself. Conclusion Westmoreland’s claim that "there is not one single federal housing program yet that has not needed a bailout to survive" has shortcomings. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been bailed out. And the FHA is in need of help, though it has not been bailed out at this point. But Fannie and Freddie did not come under federal control until 2008. They are strange creatures on the U.S. financial landscape. They were created by the government but operated independently until the housing bust. At that time, they were bailed out by the feds. The three other federal housing efforts have not been bailed out. And it’s not clear that they will need taxpayer assistance. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the FHA are much larger players in the housing market. This bolsters Westmoreland’s larger point that organizations designed to help the housing market need help, too. Westmoreland earns a Half True.	None	Lynn Westmoreland	None	None	None	2012-03-30T06:00:00	2012-02-29	['None']

pomt-00641	Georgia is on track for 1,200 traffic fatalities this year, a reversal of nine years of declines.	true	/georgia/statements/2015/may/20/russell-mcmurry/already-deadly-georgia-roads/	PolitiFact Georgia was revving up for the summer driving season when a statement from the head of the Georgia Department of Transportation caught our attention. The state is on pace to see 1,200 people lose their lives on Georgia roads this year, Commissioner Russell McMurry said in news reports. If that happens, it would be a reversal after nine years of declines. Is that possible, even before the busy season of summer? We set aside our packing – we’ll decide on a bikini or one-piece later – and decided to check. As recently as January, PolitiFact Georgia confirmed that road fatalities appeared to be declining again in Georgia. But by April, when five Georgia Southern nursing students died in a pileup crash outside Savannah, scores of single-car crashes had sent the trend line in the other direction. As of Tuesday morning, 465 people had been killed in vehicle crashes in Georgia, state DOT data show. That’s 69 more deaths, or 17 percent more, than during the same period in 2014. That keeps Georgia with an average of 100 deaths a month, which would result in a year-end total of 1,200 deaths for the first time since 2011. It would also be the first year-to-year increase in nine years, as this chart shows: Year 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Totals 1,505 1,298 1,250 1,236 1,199 1,189 1,169 So the GDOT commissioner is right on the overall numbers – a scary enough prospect. But to compare apples to apples, it’s worth calculating the rates of death as well. That is, would the current pace create the first year deaths don’t decline relative to the number of cars on the road, too? Yes, according to data from the state Department of Revenue. The number of vehicles registered annually is: Year 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Totals* 8.64 8.57 8.59 8.71 8.92 8.32 8.80 9.12 *In millions, rounded In 2008, there were about 8.6 million registered vehicles in Georgia. That translates into 1.7 deaths for every 10,000 registered car or truck. In 2014, with nearly 8.8 million registered vehicles but fewer fatalities, the rate dropped to .1.3 deaths for every 10,000 vehicles. Should Georgia stay on pace to an even 1,200 deaths – improbable but an exact number to compare against the 9.1 million vehicles registered this year – the rate holds at 1.3 deaths. It’s not an increase, of course. But it’s not the steady decline in rate, as well as overall numbers, that transportation officials had hoped to see continue and that McMurry noted. And, the rate still means that more people are dying in traffic accidents at a time when the state has seen 95 percent compliance in seat belt usage – a large factor in reducing fatalities, said Teri Pope, a spokeswoman for the Northeast DOT region. DOT data shows that 62 percent of people killed in crashes are not wearing the simple safety devices. "A lot of these deaths are preventable, and that’s the heartbreaking part of it," Pope said. In other words, driver behavior is the, well, driver of the spike in roadway deaths. In an effort to counter that, the DOT has partnered with the Governor’s Office on Highway Safety and the state Department of Public Safety to launch the Drive Alert, Arrive Alive campaign. The effort focuses on education efforts about the dangers of driving drowsy or while using mobile phones – both considered distracted driving – and greater enforcement of seat belt usage and safe driving. In other words, PolitiFact Georgia expects to see lots of safety reminder signs and state troopers on the roads. You should, too. Our ruling Georgia DOT Commissioner Russell McMurry said in recent news reports that the state is on pace to see 1,200 people die in traffic accidents this year – all before the start of the busy summer driving season. Transportation numbers back up that claim. That data, and figures about the number of registered vehicles in the state, also confirm that would be the first time in nine years that Georgia has not seen a decline in those deaths. We rate the commissioner’s statement True.	None	Russell McMurry	None	None	None	2015-05-20T00:00:00	2015-05-11	['None']
pomt-07201	Says the Ohio Consumers’ Council office employs 74 lawyers and that the funding them is wasteful duplication.	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2011/jun/07/bill-batchelder/ohio-house-speaker-william-g-batchelder-says-consu/	Absent a dramatic reversal, the Office of the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel will be classified a budget loser once lawmakers finalize the state’s two-year spending plan in the coming weeks. Republican Gov. John Kasich and Republican lawmakers have taken direct aim at the office, which is charged with protecting Ohio consumers in utility cases. The GOP-controlled House of Representatives supported Kasich’s proposal to cut 51 percent of the agency’s funding and added provisions to muzzle the office on issues related to natural gas markets and to eliminate the counsel’s call center, a repository for consumer complaints. National consumer groups sharply criticized the proposals, claiming they would prevent the office from fulfilling its mission. House Speaker William G. Batchelder, a Republican from Medina, was asked recently about the proposed cuts. Batchelder, echoing similar reasoning from Kasich, said the cuts are justified because the agency is overstaffed and because it plays a role similar to the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio. Supporters of the consumers’ counsel say the office plays a watchdog role separate from the PUCO, which decides whether to approve rate increases the utilities propose. "There are 74, I believe, attorneys in that office," Batchelder said on the Ohio News Network’s "Capitol Square" on May 29. "Is that duplicative? Is it wasteful? And I think since the legislature was busy with an axe on everything else, it makes it pretty hard to sell having the duplication or having 74 lawyers. I don’t know how many the attorney general has." PolitiFact Ohio thought 74 seemed awfully high and decided to check out the speaker’s claim. It didn’t take long to conclude Batchelder was wrong. The agency has a total of 82 employees, according to a staff listing the OCC provided. Of those workers, only 14 are attorneys. Some workers are part-time, meaning the office’s staffing level equates to 72 full-time workers. "We currently have 12 attorneys on staff assigned to case work and two vacancies. In addition to the 12 staff attorneys, the Consumers’ Counsel Janine Migden-Ostrander and the Deputy Consumers’ Counsel Bruce Weston are also attorneys," OCC spokeswoman Beth Gianforcaro wrote in an e-mail. Other departments at the OCC include the analytical department, communications, operations and the call center. Migden-Ostrander has said a 51 percent budget cut – from $8.5 million to $4.1 million, as Kasich and the House proposed – would result in layoffs and the elimination of the call center. But cutting the agency’s budget won’t save the state money. The office is entirely funded from fees levied on the state’s utilities, not tax dollars. Spending less money on the OCC would only put money back in the utilities’ pockets. On May 31, the Senate unveiled its budget proposal, which reduced the OCC’s cut to 34 percent and removed the prohibition on the counsel talking about natural gas markets, which some called a "gag order." A spokesman for Batchelder said the speaker misspoke about the number of attorneys in the office. "He was trying to assert there were 74 employees at the office of the consumers’ counsel and not 74 attorneys," Batchelder spokesman Mike Dittoe said. "We apologize for the slip of the tongue there." We’ll allow that the speaker may have misspoke, rather than purposefully misused the statistics he cited. But he did repeat the inaccuracy, and wondered aloud how that number of lawyers compared with the staff of Attorney General Mike DeWine, Ohio’s top lawyer. And the number itself is so overstated that it ecllipses the total staffing level of the consumers’ counsel office. Furthermore, his complaint about duplication of services and wasteful spending when the state is "busy with an axe on everything" is misleading because funding for the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel doesn’t come from general tax revenues. Rather, it is raised through fees levied on utilities. PolitiFact Ohio has noted before that as speaker, Batchelder is one of the most influential politicians in the state and Ohioans listen to what he says. In this case, he made the claim on a television broadcast on a statewide news network. And in this case his statement is not just inaccurate, but also makes a ridiculous claim. When that happens, the Truth-O-Meter points to one rating: Pants on Fire.	None	William G. Batchelder	None	None	None	2011-06-07T06:00:00	2011-05-29	['None']
pomt-00603	"Thanks to restrictive and anticompetitive ballot laws," candidates in November 2014 ran unopposed in nearly half of Wisconsin’s state representative races but in Michigan and Minnesota nearly all races had challengers.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jun/03/andy-craig/ballot-laws-mean-only-half-assembly-races-are-cont/	When state Assembly seats are on the ballot, Wisconsin voters have far fewer candidates to choose from than residents of neighboring Minnesota and Michigan, a group called Competitive Elections Wisconsin claims. In a May 11, 2015 letter to Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester), a leader of the group who is also an official with the Libertarian Party of Wisconsin took the claim a step further. "The problem is simple. For all offices in Wisconsin, the number of signatures required for nomination petitions is too high," Andy Craig wrote in the letter, which was released publicly. "These levels are set such that incumbents and candidates with party backing can meet them with ease, but upstart challengers are often scared off from even attempting it." The result, Craig contends, is that nearly half of the candidates elected to the Wisconsin Assembly in November 2014 were alone on the general-election ballot. By contrast, he continued, "just 9 out of 134 Representatives ran unopposed in Minnesota. In Michigan all 110 State Representative elections were contested by both major parties." "It is hard to believe that people in Wisconsin are that much more disinterested in deciding who their legislators are," Craig wrote. Craig’s letter caught our attention. Wisconsin historically has high voter turnout. Can our legislative races be so uncompetitive -- and is it due to unusually high hurdles to candidacy? The evidence When we asked Craig, a 2014 Libertarian candidate for secretary of state, to back up his claim, he pointed to the Ballotpedia and Ballot Access News websites. The websites include tallies of contested races and state-by-state comparisons of candidacy requirements. Regarding the contention that lower ballot access hurdles result in more candidates and fewer uncontested elections, Craig told us, "that seems self-evident, primarily in the comparison to other states that make it easier." He also cited his experiences recruiting and assisting candidate, some of whom missed making the ballot because they couldn't get enough signatures in time. We checked with election experts and compiled our own tallies of contested races from state election websites. Here’s what we found: Michigan and Minnesota did have at least two candidates facing off in the 2014 general elections in virtually all cases cited. And Wisconsin’s Assembly candidates were unopposed in nearly half the races. (It should be noted that in 17 state Senate races, Wisconsin had only two without multiple candidates. But the group’s claim focused on Assembly races, and even when including both senators and representatives there are still far more uncontested races in Wisconsin than in the other two states.) That gap between those states is longstanding, according to research by the National Institute on Money in State Politics. And mirroring a national trend, Wisconsin has seen the number of uncontested Assembly races double since the mid-1970s, Ballotpedia reported. Why is there a gap? Now to the "why" part. Craig points out, correctly, that Michigan and Minnesota allow candidates to pay $100 filing fees to secure a ballot spot if they don’t want to collect signatures from residents. Wisconsin does not allow the filing fee option. Elsewhere in the Midwest, two others states with a lot of uncontested 2014 races -- neighboring Illinois and Iowa -- similarly have no option to forgo signature collection. Richard Winger, editor of Ballot Access News, said he thinks relatively more difficult ballot access rules explain the differences in those states. "Asking strangers for signatures is somewhat like hitch-hiking," Winger said. "It is psychologically difficult for most people to ask for favors from strangers." Winger is a widely quoted expert on ballot access laws and advocates for fairness in allowing minor party candidates on ballots. We heard a more skeptical view from Barry Burden, an expert in election administration at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. As parties, the Democrats and Republicans quality for ballot lines pretty easily in all three states, and there is little doubt that any of them would lose their status as major parties, Burden said. He added that it can be harder for minor party candidates to get on ballots. But the claim rests on what individuals have to do to get on ballots. The fee option might attract more candidates, Burden said, because it is low and, since it can be paid at the last moment, requires little organization or planning. But the signature requirements are also low, he said. That requirement is lower in Wisconsin (200 for Assembly candidates) than Minnesota (500) for major party candidates. In Michigan, the rule is 200 for major party candidates and 600 for independents. "Any candidate who has at least a skeletal organization or a little free time should be able to scoop up a couple hundred signatures without much trouble," Burden said. Burden and others suggest that other factors are at play. For the last two election cycles in Wisconsin, the redrawing of legislative district lines has helped to squelch competition, Burden said. As the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s Craig Gilbert reported in "Dividing Lines", that redistricting and the ultra-polarized geography of southeastern Wisconsin mean that "there are practically no competitive seats in the most populous part of this competitive swing state." Burden said party strategy differences can determine whether parties field candidates in "lost causes" areas. In Minnesota, Burden noted, public funding of elections there is more likely to enhance competition by luring in candidates who might otherwise believe they would be unable to compete financially. In Michigan, some have suggested that the state’s term limits enhance competition. Burden disagreed, saying that by creating automatic openings every six to eight years, term limits actually reduce competition in other years. Strong candidates, he said, typically wait to run until the incumbent is forced from office. Our rating Andy Craig of Competitive Elections Wisconsin claimed: "Thanks to restrictive and anticompetitive ballot laws," candidates in November 2014 ran unopposed in nearly half of Wisconsin’s state legislative races but in Michigan and Minnesota were challenged in nearly all races. There’s no dispute that Wisconsin dramatically lags those states in competitive races, and ballot access rule differences are one possible factor in that gap. But it’s clear that other factors are at play as well. We rate his claim Half True.	None	Andy Craig	None	None	None	2015-06-03T05:00:00	2015-05-11	['Minnesota', 'Michigan', 'Wisconsin']
pomt-04698	"Seven presidents before (Barack Obama) -- Republicans and Democrats -- tried to expand health care to all Americans."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/05/julian-castro/julian-castro-says-seven-presidents-barack-obama-s/	President Barack Obama’s health care law has been one of the most polarizing aspects of his presidency, with Republicans criticizing it at every turn. But the keynote speaker at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro, didn’t run from it. He applauded Obama for pursuing expanded health care -- and succeeding where his predecessors had failed. "Seven presidents before him -- Republicans and Democrats -- tried to expand health care to all Americans," Castro said. "President Obama got it done." We wondered whether Castro’s history was correct. So we checked with a variety of public policy and health care historians and found that Castro’s in the ballpark -- but that a lot of caveats are in order. Let’s start with the presidents who almost certainly fit Castro’s definition of having "tried to expand health care to all Americans." • Harry Truman. On Nov. 19, 1945, Truman wrote a message to Congress saying that "the health of American children, like their education, should be recognized as a definite public responsibility." According to the Truman Library, "the most controversial aspect of the plan was the proposed national health insurance plan." It called for "the creation of a national health insurance fund to be run by the federal government. This fund would be open to all Americans, but would remain optional. Participants would pay monthly fees into the plan, which would cover the cost of any and all medical expenses that arose in a time of need. The government would pay for the cost of services rendered by any doctor who chose to join the program." The American Medical Association attacked the plan, characterizing the bill as "socialized medicine." Truman ultimately abandoned the effort after the outbreak of the Korean War • Richard Nixon. In 1971 and 1974, Nixon offered separate proposals to expand health insurance to all, or nearly all, Americans. Generally speaking, they involved employer mandates to provide health insurance, supplemented by subsidies for poorer Americans. "I shall propose a sweeping new program that will assure comprehensive health-insurance protection to millions of Americans who cannot now obtain it or afford it, with vastly improved protection against catastrophic illnesses," he said in 1974. The 1974 effort gained some traction in Congress but faltered as Nixon became consumed by scandal. "Had it not been for his destruction as a result of the Watergate affair, legislation might well have passed during his presidency," said Princeton University health care historian Paul Starr, the author of Remedy and Reaction: The Peculiar American Struggle over Health Care Reform. • Bill Clinton. In 1993 and 1994, Clinton -- in a process spearheaded by First Lady Hillary Clinton -- sought to pass a major overhaul of the health care system that would have aimed for universal coverage. Even though the Democrats controlled Congress at the time, the plan did not win enactment. So that’s an easy three. It isn’t much of a stretch to get a fourth: • Lyndon Johnson. Technically, Johnson never sought full universal health care. But it seems churlish to deny inclusion on this list to the man who signed Medicare and Medicaid into law. They aren’t universal care for everybody, but they are universal care for large subsets of the population. You can add a few more if you lower the bar a bit. • John F. Kennedy. Kennedy voiced strong support for legislation that would ultimately become Medicare. On May 20, 1962, he held a televised rally to push the proposal at a packed Madison Square Garden in New York City. (The American Journal of Public Health later noted that hours later, the AMA rented the empty hall to film a rebuttal by its president, without showing the empty seats.) But he died before the legislation could come to fruition.) • Gerald Ford. Ford endorsed Nixon’s second proposal, but it didn’t get far on his brief watch. • Jimmy Carter. Carter proposed "a step-by-step plan to achieve universal coverage," Starr said. "It came relatively late in his first term, and it was too weak to satisfy (Democratic Sen.) Ted Kennedy and many other Democrats." Carter’s efforts were "halfhearted," said Brown University political scientist James Morone, co-author of The Heart of Power: Health and Politics in the Oval Office from Roosevelt to Bush. You can actually add a couple more if you bend Castro’s definition even further. • Theodore Roosevelt. He did endorse the idea of expanding health insurance to all, but only as as a presidential candidate for the Bull Moose Party in 1912, not during his earlier term in the White House. • Franklin D. Roosevelt. In his State of the Union address in 1943, Roosevelt called for a social insurance system that would extend "from the cradle to the grave," and he was preparing a program and a speech on national health insurance at the time of his death. In the midst of World War II, Roosevelt never pursued it in earnest, but Truman took up the mantle instead • Dwight Eisenhower. Eisenhower reacted to Democratic proposals for single-payer health care by proposing an expansion of care within the model of private-sector medicine. Eisenhower’s approach was to make permanent the tax break for employer-sponsored health coverage (which remains today) in order to encourage as many Americans as possible to get covered through their workplace. For those who were not employed, Eisenhower proposed that the government "reinsure" private insurance companies to encourage them to add less profitable populations to their coverage rolls. While Morone calls the Eisenhower plan relatively "timid," it nonetheless sparked the AMA’s opposition, which helped kill it in Congress. The remaining Republican presidents did act to expand health coverage in certain ways, but none of our experts thought they met Castro’s definition of pushing for universal health care. • Ronald Reagan signed the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, which requires hospitals to serve patients in urgent need, and the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, or COBRA, which allows individuals to keep paying for coverage if they lose their insurance. In addition, with almost no support from his own cabinet, Reagan added catastrophic care to Medicare toward the end of his presidency, though the provision was later repealed. • George H.W. Bush, worried about the Democrats getting traction with health care in a 1991 Senate special election, sent a plan to congress. "Bush didn't like the issue, but he had a really good health team that put together a pretty good republican proposal," Morone said. • George W. Bush pushed for and signed the expansion of Medicare to include prescription drug coverage. Putting it all together, "you could cut the number to five or raise it to eight depending on how strictly you want to interpret Castro’s words," Starr said. Our ruling Castro said that "seven presidents before (Obama) -- Republicans and Democrats -- tried to expand health care to all Americans." It’s a slam dunk getting to three or four presidents, and it’s possible to reach seven presidents, but to do that requires a looser interpretation of expanding coverage "to all Americans." On balance, we rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-07429	Salaries for Virginia’s teachers are below the national average.	true	/virginia/statements/2011/apr/25/kitty-boitnott/education-association-president-says-virginia-teac/	The Virginia Education Association has complained for decades that salaries for state teachers are below the national average. Kitty Boitnott, president of the 60,000-member organization, made the claim during an April 20 interview with WVTF Public Radio in Roanoke about merit pay for educators. "The General Assembly has offered numerous times to get our teachers into the national average, and we’re certainly nowhere near that, and yet now we’re going to offer limited incentives to just a handful of people," Boitnott said. "That doesn’t make sense to me." We examined her claim that state teachers are paid below the national average. Carol Donohue, the assistant director of government relations for the Virginia Education Association, said Boitnott’s information comes from a December 2010 report from the National Education Association. The report shows that the average 2010-2011 salary for classroom teachers in Virginia was $51,559. That’s about 9 percent lower than the average national public teacher salary of $56,069, according to the report. Virginia had plenty of company in paying its teachers below the national average. In addition to the Old Dominion, 34 other states had teacher salaries trailing the average, according to the NEA report. Virginia’s average pay for teachers ranked 23rd-highest among states. The top average state-wide salary was $72,708 in New York, while the lowest was $35,201 in South Dakota. So in raw dollars, Virginia’s average teacher salary ranks near the middle of states. The amount of money it takes to live comfortably in Virginia is going to be different than what it takes in New York or South Dakota. So we looked at where Virginia ranks in cost of living. Virginia was the 26th most expensive state to live in during the last quarter of 2010, according to a report by the Missouri Department of Economic Development. In other words, Virginia ranks in the middle of state both in teacher salaries and cost of living. The VEA has long argued that Virginia is wealthy and can afford to pay teachers better than most states. Higher salaries, it argues, would help Virginia recruit and retain the best instructors. We looked at Virginia’s ability to pay more, turning to data from the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis. In 2010,Virginia’s per capita income was $44,762 -- the seventh highest among the states. So it’s a logical argument that Virginia has greater ability than most states to pay teachers more. Virginians have higher salaries than most Americans. Their cost of living, meanwhile, ranks in the middle of states. But we digress. Boitnott said Virginia pays its teachers below the national average and we owe you a rating on that. Her statement is True.	None	Kitty Boitnott	None	None	None	2011-04-25T06:00:00	2011-04-20	['None']
pomt-13891	Says Gov. Doug Ducey wants to use "taxpayer dollars to increase the salaries of private prison guards."	mostly true	/arizona/statements/2016/jun/29/arizona-house-democrats/arizonas-house-democrats-claim-governor-wants-incr/	Arizona House Democrats are questioning the priorities of their Republican counterparts, balking at a Department of Corrections plan to buy a $137 million privately run prison in Kingman. The Democrats say the plan, which was developed by the governor’s office, the corrections department and the Department of Administration, is bad for taxpayers. "Gov. (Doug) Ducey wants to use public, taxpayer dollars to increase the salaries of private prison guards," the Democrats wrote in a June 20 blog post. "Guards employed by a multi-billion dollar company that made nearly $140 million in profits last year." While the state wants to purchase the prison, they want a private company -- GEO Group -- to continue to manage it. Does the sale include a raise for the private corrections workers? Acronym soup The history of the Kingman prison is a bit complicated, and filled with companies with strange names, so we’ll take it slow. The prison was opened in August 2004 as part of a plan by Gov. Janet Napolitano to build more inmate beds using the private sector. As part of the original agreement, the state was scheduled to pay off the construction of the facility over 20 years and then take ownership. Until the state’s debt was paid off, a non-profit, Mohave Prison LLC, was created to own the prison. Management and Training Corporation, a Utah-based private prison operator, was originally contracted to manage Kingman. However, after multiple inmate riots in July 2015, the state fired MTC, and GEO Group assumed their contract. GEO Group is one of the largest private prison operators in the country. The Florida-based company manages more than 60 correctional facilities nationwide. Now Ducey and others in the state want to buy the Kingman prison early as part of what they say is a cost-saving measure. According to the proposal, the state owning the prison would save taxpayers more than $70 million and reduce the per-prisoner cost from $60.10 to $40.37 a day — a savings of more than 30 percent. Buying the prison nine years early would allow the state to refinance and reduce the amount of interest paid on the facility, the state says. The plan was approved by the state Legislature for fiscal year 2017 and is expected to be implemented sometime in the "next few months," according to Department of Corrections spokesman Andrew Wilder. Plan would include raises If the purchase goes through as expected, the state would officially own the prison, but it would still be managed by the GEO Group. As part of the plan, the state would offer $2 million to increase the salaries of the GEO Group workers. Keely Varvel, chief of staff for the Arizona House Democrats, pointed us to page 18 of the proposed purchase plan, which says that $2 million is intended "to increase starting salaries for correctional officers and improve retention." But there’s a big caveat: The $2 million in annual expenses would be offset by the $8 million in annual savings the state would incur for buying the prison. Pablo Paez, a spokesman for the GEO Group, called the Democrats’ claim an "unfair characterization." He said the proposal allows for "significant savings for taxpayers overall," while providing additional resources for staff wages. In essence, Paez said, Democrats are focusing on one side of the ledger -- money spent increasing salaries -- while ignoring the larger cost savings. The average salary for a state correctional officer is $36,800. Under this plan, Kingman correctional officers would see a 13 percent raise, from $29,453 to an average salary of $33,300. That’s still less than the state average and well under the national average of $45,320, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Daniel Scarpinato, a spokesman with Ducey’s office, said the overall plan, besides saving money, allows the state to "invest in ensuring public safety." Our ruling Arizona House Democrats said, "Gov. Ducey wants to use public, taxpayer dollars to increase the salaries of private prison guards." That’s literally accurate. The state contracts with GEO Group to manage the Kingman prison in question, but GEO pays its correctional officers. And if the state purchases Kingman, it would use $2 million for raises for the prison staff. The major caveat is those raises would be more-than-offset by money the state says it will save with the purchase of the Kingman facility.

pomt-06150	Says it cost Massachusetts taxpayers $100,000 when Mitt Romney and his staff purchased computer hard drives.	false	/new-hampshire/statements/2011/dec/19/democratic-national-committee/dnc-says-mitt-romney-and-staff-cost-massachusetts-/	For some opponents, the issue of electronic records during Mitt Romney’s time as Massachusetts governor has become the $100,000 question. In an advertisement released earlier this month, the Democratic National Committee accused members of the Romney administration of costing taxpayers $100,000 when they purchased their computer hard drives and wiped them clean as they left office in 2006. "When Mitt Romney left the Massachusetts governor's office, e-mails were deleted, servers wiped clean and computer hard drives went out the door with his top aides," the narrator reads in the ad, released December 6, 2011. "His and his staff's efforts cost taxpayers $100,000. All this raises one important question, what is Mitt Romney hiding?" The records issue has been well documented in recent months. Romney acknowledged in November that staff members purchased their computer hard drives as they left office. He maintained his staff did not break the law, and last month PolitiFact checked his claim that if they had turned over their records to the following administration, they would have been first. We rated the claim True. But did the Romney administration’s actions really cost taxpayers $100,000? The computer hard drives themselves didn’t cost nearly that much, according to reports. The Boston Globe, which first broke the records story last month, reported that 11 aides purchased their hard drives at the time, paying $65 dollars each for a total of $715. The $65 figure equaled both the price of a new hard drive and the installation costs, and staff members purchased the hard drives with their own money, according to Terry Dolan, who served as director of administration for six governors, including Romney, between 1985 and 2008. "That was effectively at no cost to the Commonwealth," Dolan said Thursday. "They paid the cost of a replacement hard drive. They didn’t buy the monitor, the speakers, the whole nine yards." The costs don’t end there, however. Around the time Romney aides purchased the hard drives in late 2006, his administration agreed to a new lease with their computer provider, Ontario Investments, Inc., of New York. The governor’s office was 18 months into a three-year, $108,000 lease, the first ever for the governor’s office, which had previously purchased all its computers, Dolan said. But office officials opted out of that agreement in December 2006 in favor of a new three-year, $205,900 contract to upgrade the technology. The new lease covered the same 115 computers as the original agreement, according to the contract, but added new bells and whistles. "They were 18-month old computers that were functional," Dolan said. "We got bigger screens. … I'm not sure (the old computers) had CD drives in them at that time." By a simple comparison, the two different lease documents show that the governor’s office paid about $97,000 more for the second lease than for the original. But, does this mean it cost taxpayers that much? Not so fast, Dolan says. Eighteen months remained on the original lease when administration officials initiated the new, more expensive agreement, according to the lease documents. This means administration officials would have had to renew, renegotiate or search for a new contract by June 2008, resulting in additional costs. To keep calculations even, then, you need to measure the difference between the two agreements through June 2008, when the original was set to expire. The original $108,000 lease, initially expected to run from June 2005 to June 2008, averaged a monthly cost of $3,000, while the second, which ran from December 2006 to December 2009, averaged $5,719 per month. The difference between the two monthly charges is $2,719, and multiplied by the 18 months remaining on the original lease equals a total difference of $48,942 -- about half of the DNC’s $100,000 figure, a figure first reported December 6 by Reuters. One further note: The DNC ad indicates that Romney’s staff scrapped the original computer lease because they no longer contained hard drives, which is not true, according to Dolan, Romney’s director of administration. Administration officials had already been working on the new lease when the staff members bought the hard drives, she said Thursday. "The decision was made to replace all the computers, and then inquiries were made (about buying the hard drives)," Dolan said. "To my recollection, it was something like, ‘Well, as long as the computers are going back … maybe we can keep the hard drives.’" Romney’s campaign staff did not return requests for comment. Our ruling: The total difference between the original lease and the second computer contract signed by the Romney administration was about $97,000, close to the $100,000 mentioned in the DNC ad. But this is not an apples to apples comparison. Rather, the total difference in cost passed on to taxpayers during the term of the first lease was about $49,000 -- not quite half of the DNC total. Further, administration officials had already been looking into a new computer lease when the aides purchased the hard drives, so the lease costs are not a direct result of the sale of the hard drives, as the DNC alleges. We rate the claim False.	None	Democratic National Committee	None	None	None	2011-12-19T12:43:33	2011-12-06	['Massachusetts', 'Mitt_Romney']
pomt-14240	Says Hillary Clinton supported and continues to "support fracking."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/13/bernie-sanders/does-hillary-clinton-support-fracking/	Looking to out-green Hillary Clinton in New York, Bernie Sanders charged that Clinton’s position on fracking was at odds with voters. New Yorkers ended the practice in the state in 2014, and Sanders called for a nationwide ban during an April 11 rally in Binghamton. Clinton, in contrast, remains on the side of the frackers, Sanders said on NBC’s Meet the Press, when he launched a multipart attack on Clinton’s positions on fracking, trade and campaign finance. "Well, when you vote for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions of jobs, when you support and continue to support fracking, despite the crisis that we have in terms of clean water," he said April 10, "and essentially, when you have a super PAC that is raising tens of millions of dollars from every special interest out there, including $15 million from Wall Street, the American people do not believe that that is the kind of president that we need to make the changes in America to protect the working families of this country." Was Sanders telling the fracking truth? (We examined Clinton’s support for free trade in a separate fact-check.) While Clinton’s past support of fracking is well documented, her current position leaves more wiggle room than Sanders’ statement suggests. Shale promoted 'round the world To refresh, fracking or hydraulic fracturing means producers are blasting pressurized water, sand and chemicals into shale rock miles underground to extract natural gas. The Environmental Protection Agency considers shale gas to be clean energy. Some environmentalists, though, are doubtful that it’s that much better than coal or oil, given reports that fracking can cause methane leaks (a greenhouse gas that’s much more potent than carbon dioxide) and earthquakes and set water ablaze. Clinton clearly supported the practice as secretary of state. Her special envoy for international energy affairs launched the Global Shale Gas Initiative encouraging other countries to explore shale as an energy source. An in-depth investigation by progressive magazine Mother Jones said that Clinton’s support of fracking was "part of a broader push to fight climate change, boost global energy supply, and undercut the power of adversaries such as Russia that use their energy resources as a cudgel." We found instances of Clinton and the State Department talking up fracking to Latin America, the European Union, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Bulgaria, Pakistan, China and India. "The United States will promote the use of shale gas. Now, I know that in some places is controversial. But natural gas is the cleanest fossil fuel available for power generation today, and a number of countries in the Americas may have shale gas resources," Clinton said in a 2009 speech to the Inter-American Development Bank. After Clinton left the State Department in 2013, she continued to support fracking but repeatedly called for "smart regulations" in speeches and in her book, Hard Choices. Fracking with nuance in 2016 Compared with Sanders’ unequivocal opposition and the Republicans’ strong support, Clinton has a more complicated answer when it comes to fracking. Essentially, she supports it as long as there’s environmental oversight and no local opposition. Here’s how Clinton detailed her position during the March 6 debate in Flint, Michigan: "I don’t support it when any locality or any state is against it, No. 1. I don’t support it when the release of methane or contamination of water is present. I don’t support it — No. 3 — unless we can require that anybody who fracks has to tell us exactly what chemicals they are using. So by the time we get through all of my conditions, I do not think there will be many places in America where fracking will continue to take place. And I think that’s the best approach, because right now, there are places where fracking is going on that are not sufficiently regulated." ("My answer is a lot shorter," responded Sanders. "No, I do not support fracking.") Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin referred us to Clinton’s plan "to address the fracking-related risks people are concerned about." "This is particularly important given that the federal government doesn’t get to say where fracking occurs and where it doesn’t, but can put new safeguards in place," Schwerin said. Katie Brown of Energy in Depth, the research and education arm of the Independent Petroleum Association of America, told PolitiFact that Sanders’ position to ban all fracking is outside the mainstream. "Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, joins Democrats across the county such as Sen. Chuck Schumer, and California Gov. Jerry Brown, and Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper (just to name a few), who have all touted strong regulations by the states and supported fracking for its environmental and economic benefits," Brown said. Warren Gunnels, Sanders’ policy director, referred us to a Reuters article, in which supporters of fracking cast Clinton’s comments as campaign rhetoric and opponents urged her to cut the caveats and ban it outright. But what exactly would Clinton’s caveats mean for frackers? A portrait of regulated extraction Clinton’s three conditions would uphold existing bans and add new ones to the mix. But they wouldn’t amount to a universal ban. The first condition leaves local and state bans in place, such as those in Vermont, New York and a few dozen cities and counties across America. Her second condition would add dozens of sites that have methane emissions or water contamination. Natural gas is primarily methane, so we’ll assume Clinton is talking about "fugitive emissions" or leaks. Estimates for fugitive emissions, typically expressed as a percentage of the total production, vary widely. A round up of studies by watchdog blog Carbon Brief found estimates ranging from 0.6 to 9 percent (the threshold for being cleaner than coal is 3.2 percent). Various industry and independent research has indicated that a good chunk of leaks come from a small number of "super-emitters" (roughly one in 25 facilities, according to a 2015 Colorado State University study). Clinton could ostensibly shut down these methane spewers, which include, for example, about 50 production sites in northern Texas and four lift wells in the Gulf Coast. Water contamination is not systemic, according to a controversial 2015 EPA study, which nonetheless identified 151 cases of fracking fluid spills in 11 states from 2006 to 2012. Robert Howarth, a noted critic of fracking and biogeochemist at Cornell University, estimates at least 4 percent of production wells pollute water, but contends that the problem is widespread given the sheer number of wells. Under Clinton’s condition, fracking could be banned in, for example, at least 25 counties in Pennsylvania and at least 12 counties in Colorado, if not in all 11 states with noted cases of spills. Frackers are already meeting Clinton’s third condition, to an extent. At least 26 states have some rules on chemical disclosure on the books, though most allow frackers to protect "trade secrets," according to the American Chemical Society. In addition, the Obama administration now requires drillers on federal and tribal lands to report the composition of their fracking fluid to FracFocus, an industry-backed registry of more than 100,000 wells across America. (Here’s an example.) Environmentalists contend that these rules are not nearly enough. Howarth told PolitiFact that chemical additives are "a small part of the problem." "The frack return fluids are full of really nasty materials in addition to the additives, and the precise nature of this toxic brew is seldom known," he said. "Clinton's focus on just the additives is misguided." That being said, Clinton’s condition could ban fracking in Virginia and Missouri, two states with fracking activity but no disclosure rules in place at the time of this report. Here’s a map that shows how Clinton’s conditions could affect fracking in America: Our ruling Sanders said that Clinton supported and continues "to support fracking." As secretary of state, Clinton supported and promoted fracking around the world. As a 2016 candidate, her support comes with conditions such as local choice, stronger environmental regulation and chemicals. Sanders’ claim is accurate but needs additional information.

pomt-04621	"Sen. Bob Menendez voted to enact a new tax on the sale of homes of 3.8%."	pants on fire!	/new-jersey/statements/2012/sep/17/menendez-facts/bloggers-say-bob-menendez-voted-new-38-tax-sale-ho/	A debunked claim making the rounds on the chain e-mail circuit for years has been revitalized to attack a New Jersey Democrat. A blog called "Menendez Facts" falls far short of the truth in a post claiming U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez "voted to enact a new tax on the sale of homes of 3.8%." "In 2010 Sen. Bob Menendez voted to enact a brand-new tax on the sale of homes. Sen. Bob Menendez voted for this during one of the most horrific housing markets in recent history. When families are struggling to sell their homes, as housing prices plunge Sen. Bob Menendez voted to take even more money from families struggling to sell their homes," the Sept. 4 blog post says. The post includes a chart that lists how much this new tax would cost homeowners. Sell your home for $200,000? The chart claims you would pay $7,600 in taxes. Sell your home for $500,000? That’ll cost you $19,000 in taxes, according to the chart. But that’s simply false. Menendez Facts acknowledged in an e-mail that we were fact-checking this claim and said they would update their blog post this week, but did not say how. Versions of this home sales tax claim have been checked by PolitiFact and other nonpartisan fact-checking groups several times before. The claim has been roundly declared as false and PolitiFact has rated it Pants on Fire. Such claims stem from a provision included in the 2010 national health care overhaul. On March 25, 2010, the Senate passed the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, which was the second part of the health care bill. Menendez, who is running for re-election in November, voted in favor of that bill, which included a new tax on investment income for wealthy individuals that goes into effect in 2013. The law created a 3.8 percent tax on investment income for individuals who have an adjusted gross income of more than $200,000 or couples with an adjusted gross income of more than $250,000. That investment income could include profits from real estate transactions. PolitiFact National noted in a similar fact-check in July, that those high-income earners represent less than 5 percent of all taxpayers. Individuals or couples who make less than those income thresholds would not be subject to the tax. But even if a couple earned more than those thresholds, the tax only applies to profits from the sale of a home, not the sales price itself, as the blog post claims. Also, if the home being sold is your primary residence, the first $250,000 in profits for an individual, or the first $500,000 in profits for a couple, is excluded from the tax. And for some perspective, the National Association of Realtors reported that the national median existing-home price in July was $187,300. No homeowner could make $250,000 in profit on the sale of that home and, therefore, would not pay the 3.8 percent tax. Paul Brubaker, Menendez’s campaign communications director, said in an e-mail, "Senator Menendez worked on behalf of New Jersey’s middle class families, and all Americans, to help provide them access to quality, affordable health care by helping to make the Affordable Care Act the law of the land. It is sad that, even though the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the law, some falsehoods about the law persist ­– evidently with the help of the MenendezFacts.com web site." Our ruling A blog called Menendez Facts claimed that "Sen. Bob Menendez voted to enact a new tax on the sale of homes of 3.8%." That’s a distortion of the truth. Menendez voted in favor of a bill tied to the health care law that created a tax on investment income for high-income earners. Though that investment income could include profits from real estate transactions, it is not a tax on the sales price of a home and it would not impact the vast majority of Americans. Wealthy individuals who sell their home for a large profit may be subject to the tax, but the blog does not make that clear and suggests the tax applies to the sales price of homes, regardless of an individual’s income. So again we set this ridiculous claim ablaze: Pants on Fire! To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.	None	Menendez Facts	None	None	None	2012-09-17T07:30:00	2012-09-04	['None']
pomt-04572	College tuition "costs have risen by 25 percent under the Democrats."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/25/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-spanish-language-ad-says-college-costs/	In a recent Spanish-language television ad, Mitt Romney criticizes President Barack Obama’s record on higher education. A translation provided by the campaign has the narrator saying, "Four years ago, Hispanics hoped Democrats would get an ‘A’ in improving our education. The reality is that more than 75 percent of the population thinks that college is not affordable. Tuition costs have increased 25 percent under Obama and the Democrats, and total student debt has reached a trillion dollars." After a clip of Obama saying he wants to be held accountable on education, the narrator continues in Spanish, "When it comes to education, Obama and the Democrats have failed our kids." We first checked with the Romney campaign, which said the figure came from the College Board, which produces an annual study of college costs. The College Board found that for the school-year 2008-2009, the average published tuition and fees for in-state students at public four-year colleges and universities was $6,585. By the 2011-2012 school year, it stood at $8,244. That’s an increase of slightly over 25 percent. So the claim has a grain of statistical truth. But there are several other issues to consider. The first one has to do with the translation. The exact words the narrator says are, "Los costos han subido 25 por ciento por los Demócratas," while the screen says, "25% costos de universidad," with a large arrow pointing upward. While it’s clear that the ad is saying that "costs have risen by 25 percent under the Democrats," it’s less clear whether the "costs" in question are tuition alone or tuition plus room and board. The distinction makes a difference. Tuition and fees plus room and board rose from $14,333 to $17,131 over the same period. That’s just under a 20 percent increase, short of the 25 percent claimed in the ad. Because of the uncertainty over the translation, we won’t count this as a strike against the ad’s accuracy. But other issues are more problematic: • The tuition figure is only for in-state students at public universities. The College Board also offered data for other types of schools, and each was smaller than 25 percent. Here's how much tuition and fees increased for other situations: * Public, four-year institutions -- up 19 percent. * Public, two-year colleges -- up 23 percent * Private, four-year institutions -- up 13 percent; * For-profit institutions -- up 11 percent. So, the Romney campaign was cherry-picking by using the 25 percent figure. • The 25 percent figure doesn’t adjust for inflation. The College Board data cited in the ad does not adjust for inflation. But Department of Education statistics do. According to the Education Department, inflation-adjusted costs (tuition, room and board) for all institutions were $17,257 in 2008-2009 and $18,133 in 2010-2011. That’s a 5 percent increase over two years or, extrapolating out to 2011-2012, an increase of between 7 percent and 8 percent over the same time period that the ad is talking about. Certain sectors rose faster than others -- public, four-year institutions rose by 12 percent once you extrapolate out to the full period. But even this increase is well below 25 percent. • The ad uses "published" rates, not "net costs." Universities’ published rates are like the sticker prices on cars. They are the prices before they are offset by financial aid. To students and parents, it’s actually the net cost that matters most. Due in part to financial aid programs and tax credits in Obama’s economic stimulus package, the net cost for the average student at a private, four-year institution has actually declined since 2008-2009, from $13,620 to $12,970 -- a drop of 5 percent. At public, four-year institutions, in-state students saw the net price rise from $2,310 to $2,490, an increase of 8 percent -- less than the 25 percent jump cited in the ad. • Who gets the blame for rising college costs? The escalating cost of college is nothing new -- it’s been going on for years. In fact, if you look at the trends in the inflation-adjusted Education Department data for all institutions, the rates of growth under Obama -- 2.2 percent and 2.7 percent in the years where data is available -- are lower than the rates of increase in six of the preceding eight years under President George W. Bush. Of course, the president of the United States doesn’t set college prices. Who does? A combination of the marketplace, private universities and the state-government officials such as governors and legislatures who set state subsidies for public institutions. And with the Republicans controlling a significant majority of governorships and state legislatures since 2010, as well as a sizable minority of governorships and legislatures prior to 2010, the GOP bears some responsibility as well. And as we’ve noted, the one area in which Obama had a degree of control over -- federal aid to students -- his actions have helped bring down the net cost of college. Our ruling The ad claims that "costs have risen by 25 percent under the Democrats." It’s true that the published costs for one type of college and one type of student have risen by 25 percent since Obama took office, but other data shows a smaller rise for tuition and fees, particularly when inflation is taken into account. Even for the college costs that have risen, the Romney campaign does not provide sufficient proof to link that rise to Obama. Governors and legislatures bear far more responsibility for rising prices at public universities, and to the extent Obama has had any effect, it has been to help slow or even decrease the cost burden through federal assistance to students. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-09-25T16:09:52	2012-09-21	['None']
pomt-12686	"A woman working full-time is paid 79 to 80 cents for every dollar a man is paid, and it's even less for women of color, and on average $11,000 per year is lost simply because she isn't a man."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2017/mar/14/patricia-farley/taking-closer-look-florida-democrats-claims-about-/	Dozens of women rallied Tuesday at the Florida Capitol to fight for equal pay for women and men. Democrats organized the rally to bring attention to SB 410 and HB 319, which have not been scheduled for a hearing. The bills would enact penalties on employers who pay women less than men, allow victims of discrimination to sue for wages, and would extend protections to the transgender workers. An official of the Democratic Women's Club of Florida offered up a quick snapshot of the reality of today’s gender pay gap, which refers to the difference between what men and women earn. "A woman working full-time is paid 79 to 80 cents for every dollar a man is paid, and it's even less for women of color, and on average $11,000 per year is lost simply because she isn't a man," said one of the club’s vice presidents, Patricia Farley. We did not hear back from Farley, but PolitiFact has explored claims about the gender pay gap more than once. Farley is referencing data widely available from the U.S. Census Bureau. ‘A woman working full-time is paid 79 to 80 cents for every dollar a man is paid’ This stat has become a rallying cry for those who seek to eliminate employment discrimination based on gender. And it’s backed by U.S. Census Bureau data. In a report released in September 2016, the Census Bureau wrote that in 2015, the female-to-male earnings ratio of full-time, year-round workers was 0.80. Translated into dollars, that means that in 2015, women working full-time earned 80 cents for every dollar earned by men working full-time. The figure should be used with caution. For instance, former President Barack Obama’s administration released an ad that said women are paid "77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men" in 2012. That’s not accurate. The figure derived from a federal government measure actually refers to the average disparity between what men and women earn, so saying "the same work" is inaccurate. Also, discrimination is not the only explanation for a difference in pay. Other factors include: the degrees women pursue, the jobs women pursue, time taken off to take care of children, and the number of hours worked and experience. For instance, as of 2014, women worked in more minimum wage jobs than men. Excluding all those factors, a study by the American Association of University Women 2013 found a 7 percent wage gap between men and women a year after graduating college. As Farley said, women of color earn even less. A 2014 report from the National Women’s Law Center concluded that black women made 60 cents to the dollar earned by a white man, and Hispanic women made 55 cents, according to the report. Asian-American women actually earn higher wages than black and Hispanic men and women, as well as white women according to Pew Research. Still, Asian-American women lag behind white males for annual earnings. ‘On average $11,000 per year is lost’ Farley’s last point can be calculated by looking at the same 2015 Census data for the median earnings of full-time, year-round workers who are 15 years old and up, regardless of occupation. If you look at those numbers, the median wage in 2015 was $40,742 for women and $51,212 for men. The average difference is $10,470, which is very close to Farley’s $11,000. This pattern holds consistent if you look at data from the last five years. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Other data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks average annual weekly median earnings of full-time salary workers 16-and-older using the Current Population Survey. In 2016, median weekly earnings for women were $749, or $38,948 a year. Men brought in $915 a week, or $47,580 a year. This produces a smaller average annual earnings difference of $8,632. Experts have said, however, that looking at a longer period of time would be more useful to draw conclusions. "I think the average does help, but I'd rather see the lifetime earnings calculated for the mean and median female worker rather than extrapolating from the average for one year," said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist, told us in 2014. Our ruling Farley said that a "woman working full-time is paid 79 to 80 cents for every dollar a man is paid, and it's even less for people of color, and on average $11,000 per year is loss every year simply because she isn't a man." Farley is citing common talking points that can be backed up by data from the U.S. Census Bureau. While her figures are accurate, a bulletproof number to illustrate the gender gap will always be murky because the difference in pay can be affected by the careers women and men choose and taking time off to take care for children.

pomt-07923	Secure Communities "has a proven track record of enhancing public safety by focusing on violent offenders and those that pose a threat to our communities and our national security."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/jan/30/peter-kilmartin/kilmartin-says-secure-communities-program-has-prov/	Just days after he was sworn into office, Attorney General Peter F. Kilmartin made news by signing an agreement to implement a federal program called Secure Communities, which the federal government says it created to identify and deport illegal immigrants who have committed serious crimes. The decision came less than a week after Governor Chafee rescinded his predecessor’s executive order targeting undocumented immigrants. Among other things, Chafee’s decision ended a cooperative program between the state police and the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency to enforce immigration laws. Under the Secure Communities program, fingerprints of arrested suspects are sent to the Department of Homeland Security, which checks them against a database of immigration violators and others. ICE then prioritizes whom it will take action against, based on the severity of the person’s criminal background and the threat he or she poses to communities. ICE plans to implement the program nationwide. It is now in use in 37 states, although it’s only statewide in seven. In a Jan. 11 news release announcing Rhode Island’s intent to join the program, Kilmartin said: "Secure Communities is a proactive method of making neighborhoods safe by dealing with individuals who have committed crimes against us. The program has a proven track record of enhancing public safety by focusing on violent offenders and those that pose a threat to our communities and our national security." Kilmartin’s announcement triggered complaints from opponents of Secure Communities, and a noisy protest in the lobby of the attorney general’s building. Critics, including Steven Brown, executive director of the Rhode Island Affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union, say the program has led to thousands of deportations of people with no criminal records. They also say it leads to racial profiling and deters victims and witnesses of crimes from coming forward if they or family members are undocumented immigrants. We wondered whether Kilmartin’s assertion -- that the program focuses on "violent offenders" and "threats to our communities and national security" -- was accurate. When we called Kilmartin’s office, his spokeswoman, Amy Kempe, said Kilmartin was relying on information from ICE and directed us to that agency. So we contacted Ross Feinstein, spokesman for ICE in Washington, D.C. He said in an email that in 2010, ICE "set a record for overall removals of illegal aliens, with more than 392,000 removals nationwide." He said more than half of those removed were convicted criminals. Feinstein said the Secure Communities program alone, from its beginning in October 2008, has identified and led to the "removal" of more than 59,300 aliens convicted of crimes. We also found the program has plenty of critics. Three groups that oppose Secure Communities fought ICE in federal court and won a judgment ordering the agency to reveal data about the program. The groups -- the Center for Constitutional Rights, the National Day Laborer Organization and the Immigration Justice Clinic at the Cardoza School of Law at Yeshiva University in New York City -- are part of a national initiative called "Uncover the Truth." Sarahi Uribe, national coordinator of Uncover the Truth, said the group obtained documents in recent months from ICE that show that the majority of the people picked up in the program are not hardened criminals. "It’s amazing because they continue marketing the program as targeting serious criminals, even though the numbers don’t support it," Uribe said. Among the records obtained are monthly data for Secure Communities from October 2009 through August 2010. The records show that during that period, 41,929 people were identified through Secure Communities for deportation, as so-called "removals and returns." Those people were divided into four categories based on criminal record. A total of 9,667 -- about 23 percent -- were classified as Level 1 offenders: those convicted of "aggravated felonies such as murder, rape or sexual abuse of a minor." Another 16,581 -- about 40 percent -- were labeled as Level 2 offenders: those convicted of any felony, or three or more misdemeanors. A total of 4,621 -- about 11 percent -- were Level 3 offenders: those convicted of crimes punishable by less than one year in prison, typically misdemeanors. And 11,060 people -- about 26 percent -- had no criminal record at all. So ICE’s own data shows that, in the second year of a two-year program, 37 percent of the immigrants deported were either non-criminals or had been convicted of minor crimes. Asked to respond, ICE’s Feinstein said that the agency’s priority is "to initiate enforcement against criminal aliens," but that doesn’t "preclude ICE from initiating action against immigration violators and others subject to removal at the time of encounter. In fact, there are classes of non-criminals that are also ICE priorities." He said the so-called "non-criminal aliens" are "non-U.S. citizens arrested and booked for a crime who have no recorded conviction but have one or more immigration violations and are priorities for ICE to remove due to various reasons, such as: visa overstay, an illegal entry, an illegal reentry after removal, a final order of removal in place, known gang affiliations, ICE fugitives, etc." Kempe, after checking back with ICE officials, said the attorney general believes people convicted of even relatively minor crimes -- selling marijuana, painting graffiti or vandalizing a neighborhood -- are threats to the community. That may be. But we believe that, in the light of the ICE data, Kilmartin went too far when he said Secure Communities "has a proven record" of focusing on "violent offenders" and "threats to communities and our national security." That may be the intent, but the numbers show a mixed result. We rule his statement Half True.	None	Peter Kilmartin	None	None	None	2011-01-30T00:01:00	2011-01-11	['None']
pomt-09321	Crist sent his "top policy staffer to the House Committee to testify in support of the proposal," then vetoed the bill.	true	/florida/statements/2010/apr/15/adam-hasner/charlie-crist-SB6-adam-hasner/	Gov. Charlie Crist's decision to veto a controversial education bill linking teacher raises to student performance created a swift backlash from Republicans who considered the measure a legislative priority. House Majority Leader Adam Hasner, R-Delray Beach, reacted less than 10 minutes after Crist announced his veto of Senate Bill 6 on April 15, 2010. “I'm disappointed that after sending his top policy staffer to the House Committee to testify in support of the proposal, Governor Crist would change his mind and now veto the bill,” Hasner said in a press release. We know Republicans have said Crist supported and would sign the bill -- Republican Party of Florida Chairman and state Sen. John Thrasher went as far as to say Crist promised he would sign the bill -- but did Crist ask a staffer to attend a committee hearing to indicate the governor's support? State records show -- and video evidence confirms -- that a Crist staffer did attend a House committee hearing in support of the education bill. On March 25, 2010, at a hearing of the House PreK-12 Policy Committee, Crist education policy chief Terry Golden said she supported the teacher pay bill on behalf of the Office of the Governor. Here's a copy of the appearance record from the meeting, which was first obtained by the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. PolitiFact Florida also watched an archived video of the 3-hour, 40-minute hearing, to see if Golden attended the meeting, and if she indicated she supported the teacher tenure bill. Two hours and 55 minutes into the committee hearing, Golden is recognized to speak. She stands up from her seat and says: "The Office of the Governor waives in support." The comment is typical in committee meetings when a group indicates its position but does not wish to take the time to address the full committee. (If the first video link doesn't work, try this one). A corresponding action packet from the meeting also lists Golden as a "proponent" of the bill. It should be noted that the bill that the governor ultimately vetoed was almost exactly the one that appeared at that March 25 committee meeting. The only change, the Sun-Sentinel reported, was an amendment by Sen. Evelyn Lynn to allow principals to take into account advanced degrees in their performance reviews. On the governor's Web site, Golden is listed as a policy chief in the Education Policy Unit of the Governor's Office of Policy and Budget. Golden also is a registered lobbyist for the governor's office. Previously she worked as a lobbyist for Mixon and Associates, a Tallahassee lobbying group that lists nine school districts among its clients. We tried to call Golden to ask who asked her to attend the hearings on SB 6 and its companion bill, HB 7189, and why she indicated support of the bills. But Golden's office referred our inquiries to the governor's press office. Crist spokesman Sterling Ivey said Golden supported the teacher tenure bill under orders from Kathy Mears – the governor’s director of legislative affairs – and Ken Granger, policy director of the Governor’s Office of Policy and Budget. “I think at the end of March, conceptually the Executive Office of the Governor was in support of the direction of the bill,” Ivey said, noting that Golden works for Crist's top education policy adviser Scott Kittel. Crist, however, told a group of reporters on April 14, 2010, that he didn't know Golden ("I don't even know who that person is -- though I'm sure they're a great person") or why she indicated that she supported the bill on Crist's behalf. "I'm me and they're them," Crist told the reporters in an exchange that was caught on video. "What I've learned ... is that a lot of times people will say that the governor's office feels this way and the governor's office feels that way, and regrettably from time to time, rare though that may be, they may not have actually talked to the governor." That may be true, but the one ultimately responsible for the actions of Crist's administration is Crist. A Crist education policy staffer went to a House committee hearing on March 25 and indicated the governor's support for a controversial teacher pay plan. Three weeks later, Crist vetoed essentially the same bill. We rate Hasner's statement True. Story has been updated with comments from Crist spokesman Sterling Ivey.

pomt-03040	"Nobody's addicted to" marijuana.	false	/florida/statements/2013/oct/08/john-morgan/john-morgan-says-nobodys-addicted-marijuana/	High-profile Orlando attorney John Morgan is leading an effort in Florida to legalize medical marijuana, arguing that the drug is safer and cheaper than other painkillers. As a recent guest on Bay News 9’s Political Connections, Morgan also discussed whether marijuana is addictive. "Nobody's addicted to it," Morgan claimed. We decided to fact-check Morgan’s claim based on input from readers. But we didn’t have to dig too far. Morgan told us he was wrong. "It was a huge mistake," said Morgan. "I’m sorry and embarrassed I messed up." Morgan said he was "flat out wrong" about marijuana not being addictive and meant to focus on the use of the drug compared to more potent painkillers. "Some levels of addiction kill you -- marijuana may make you slow, but it will never kill you," said Morgan, a personal injury attorney who is leading the group People United for Medical Marijuana. The group has launched a petition drive to add an amendment to the state’s Constitution to legalize medical marijuana in 2014. Even though Morgan said he made a mistake, we were curious enough to check a few more sources. Aaron Norton, a psychotherapist who specializes in addictive disorders, said that "cannabis dependence is a diagnosable disorder." "Not everyone who uses it becomes addicted," said Norton, but some are more vulnerable, including people with mental disorders, adolescents and young adults. "In the course of my career, I have probably treated hundreds of patients who are cannabis-dependent, and many of them also met the two diagnostic criteria associated with physiological dependence -- tolerance and withdrawal," Norton said. Marijuana abuse is recognized as cannabis-use disorder in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The manual’s list of symptoms include craving; taking larger doses over a longer period of time than intended; recurrent use that results in failure to fulfill major obligations at work, school or home; and tolerance (needing more to get the desired high). It’s also described as an addictive substance by the government-funded National Institute on Drug Abuse, which writes: "Estimates from research suggest that about 9 percent of users become addicted to marijuana; this number increases among those who start young (to about 17 percent, or 1 in 6) and among daily users (to 25-50 percent)." Psychiatrist Dr. Darren Rothschild, an addiction medicine specialist, says he’s worked with patients who have developed a serious dependence on marijuana and "the impact is substantial." "In order to feel normal, they have to have the drug," Rothschild said. "Not everyone who smokes becomes addicted, but it’s erroneous to say it doesn’t happen." Rothschild said people who smoke marijuana daily over a long period of time are the ones most susceptible to dependence on marijuana versus intermittent smokers who may occasionally smoke pot at a party. "I’d say none of those people are addicted." Dr. Samir Sabbag, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Division of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Treatment and Research, said "long-term use of marijuana is indeed addictive," though he noted people can be addicted to a variety of things, including the caffeine in chocolate and coffee. Even groups that support relaxing marijuana laws, such as the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), concede that Morgan was incorrect to say that marijuana is not potentially addictive. "Can people have an abusive relationship with marijuana? Absolutely," said NORML executive director Allen St. Pierre. But St. Pierre says marijuana is "not addictive in any way shape or form the same way that alcohol, nicotine and other legal and illegal drugs, even caffeine, can cause serious withdrawal." Our ruling Orlando attorney John Morgan said that "nobody’s addicted to" marijuana. Morgan quickly admitted that he was wrong, and experts agreed. We rate the claim False.

pomt-11978	Says a photograph shows Seattle Seahawks player Michael Bennett burning the United States flag.	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/sep/29/vets-trump/fake-photo-shows-seattle-seahawks-player-michael-b/	A photograph plastered on a Facebook page that allegedly supports President Donald Trump purported to show an NFL player burning an American flag in the locker room, but it has very clearly been manipulated. An image posted on the "Vets for Trump" Facebook page on Sept. 28, 2017, showed Seattle Seahawks defensive end Michael Bennett shirtless and holding a United States flag that has been set ablaze. Teammates, coaches and staff appear to be cheering Bennett on in the background. "#Seattleseahawks - no more NFL," the caption on the post read. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Commenters were outraged by the photo, with one person declaring "burning the Flag that I shed my blood to honor would be just cause to whack you upside your ignorant disrespectful head." Another ironically wrote that he "couldn't even in good conscious photo shop such a picture." The Vets for Trump Facebook page didn’t accept messages or list phone or email information. It listed as contact information the website VeteransForDonaldTrump.com, a domain registered to someone named Vladimir Lemets. Trump targeted the NFL after a handful of players had decided to kneel during the playing of the Star-Spangled Banner, as a protest against racism in America. Trump demanded on Twitter that NFL players "stop disrespecting our Flag & Country" by kneeling during the national anthem to protest racism in America. Trump had said players should be fired if they refused to stand. More than 200 players across the league chose not to stand the following weekend to show their opposition to Trump’s criticism. Both the Seahawks and the Tennessee Titans chose not to stand on the field for the national anthem during their Sept. 24 game in Nashville (all but one member of the Pittsburgh Steelers chose not stand on the sideline for the song, either). But while the Seahawks banded together in protest, Bennett did not burn a flag in the locker room that day. Looking at the photo more closely, it’s obvious that the flag has been Photoshopped into the image. The lighting is all wrong and even though the flag is ablaze in an enclosed space, it doesn’t appear to be giving off smoke. The real proof that the image is fake is that it is actually close to two years old, at least. It appeared in a tweet from the Seahawks on Jan. 3, 2016, and is credited to Rob Mar on the team’s website. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com For the record, Bennett did speak out on the Trump controversy. He said at a CNN town hall event on Sept. 27 that the protests were "about treating people like human beings." "The changes start with the heart," he said. "This is not a violent protest. This is a peaceful protest. We are challenging people spiritually, not physically, spiritually to change the way you have been doing. Change the culture." Trump’s feud has led to other fake claims beyond this one. We previously checked claims that the NFL fined Steelers players $1 million each and that Fox Sports refused to broadcast games "until players respect the flag." We rated both Pants On Fire!

pomt-02869	Under Obama, the national debt "has been reduced every year for the last five years."	false	/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/14/al-sharpton/al-sharpton-attacks-sarah-palin-comparing-slavery-/	The Rev. Al Sharpton used his MSNBC show PoliticsNation Tuesday to criticize former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin for recently likening the national debt to slavery. But in doing so, Sharpton and pundit Goldie Taylor made a common mistake -- confusing the national debt with the deficit. Here’s what Sharpton said: "I mean, first of all, slavery in the American context was based on race. So you can’t talk about slavery in American context without talking about race," said Sharpton, reacting to Palin’s defense that her comparison is not racist. "But second of all … the debt … by the way has been reduced every year for the last five years under this president." Taylor then chimed in, "You know, our national debt is as low as it has been since World War II. And so the notion that our national debt is growing at some astronomical rate really is a misnomer." In this case, Sharpton’s specific claim is wrong. The debt has risen each year in terms of dollar amount and as a share of the economy since 2007. And it will continue to increase this year, said Jason Peuquet, Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget research fellow. On Jan. 20, 2009, when Obama took office, the country’s total outstanding debt was $10.6 trillion. It stood at $17.1 trillion as of Nov. 8, 2013, according to the Treasury Department’s "Debt to the Penny" calculator. What Sharpton likely meant to say is that the deficit "has been reduced every year for the last five years." The deficit is the difference between what a government collects in revenues and spends in any one year. The debt is the accumulation of annual deficits minus any annual surpluses. We’re not letting Sharpton off the hook for his words, especially because he should know the difference, but if he had said deficit he’d be closer to the truth. The country started running a deficit instead of a surplus in 2002, at $159 billion. The recent run of deficits peaked in 2009 at $1.4 trillion, Obama’s first year in office. Since then, it’s come down, and there are a couple of ways to count that. One way is in sheer dollars, through historical tables from the White House Office of Management and Budget and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office: 2008: $458.6 billion deficit 2009: $1.413 trillion deficit 2010: $1.294 trillion deficit 2011: $1.299 trillion deficit 2012: $1.087 trillion deficit 2013*: $642 billion deficit * estimated In this view, the deficit fell in 2010, 2012 and 2013, but increases in 2011. By another measure -- the deficit as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product -- the deficit did fall four consecutive years. Not five, as Sharpton tried to indicate. Unlike in the current-dollar method, the deficit as a measure of GDP between 2010 and 2011 because GDP grew faster in that year, said Alan Auerbach, a University of California economics and law professor. The deficit as a percentage of GDP shot up from 3 percent in 2008 to 10.1 percent in 2009. We turn again to data from White House Office of Management and Budget to look at the trend. 2008: 3.2 percent deficit 2009: 10.1 percent deficit 2010: 9 percent deficit 2011: 8.7 percent deficit 2012: 7 percent deficit 2013*: 6 percent deficit *estimated Projections from the Congressional Budget Office show slightly different percentages, but the trend remains the same for those years. CBO, however, estimates the deficit will fall through 2015 but tick up again in 2016 and beyond. "So, the deficit fell between 2009 and 2012," said Harvey Rosen, Princeton University economics professor, by email. "However, both figures are much bigger than anything since the early 70s (and I suspect since the late 1940s.)" Our ruling Sharpton said that the national debt "has been reduced every year for the last five years." Sharpton confused the downward trend in annual deficits with the debt, which is what he said on air and what Palin controversially likened to slavery. We rate his claim False.

pomt-11473	"Adolf Hitler confiscated all the weapons — took all the weapons, had a registry of everybody — and then on the night of June 30, 1934, sent out his secret police and murdered all of his political opponents."	false	/florida/statements/2018/mar/06/david-simmons/florida-lawmaker-mangles-nazis-gun-control-history/	During a key vote in the Florida Senate to reject an assault weapons ban, Republican Sen. David Simmons argued that the original reason for the Second Amendment was so people could protect themselves from a tyrannical government. Simmons invoked the Nazis to drive home his point. "Adolf Hitler confiscated all the weapons -- took all the weapons, had a registry of everybody -- and then on the night of June 30, 1934, sent out his secret police and murdered all of his political opponents," Simmons said March 3. "You think it doesn't happen in a free society? It does." We reached out to Simmons and did not hear back, but Hitler’s gun policies are a familiar talking point among opponents of gun control, and one that we explored during the 2016 presidential campaign. Simmons’ statement misses several historical facts. Hitler was both a giver and a taker By the time Hitler took power in 1933, Germany had been operating under the 1928 Law on Firearms and Ammunition. The measure relaxed strict controls imposed after World War I that banned all gun ownership, and created a system to register and sell firearms. Columbia University law professor Bernard Harcourt translated a couple of key provisions in the law that exempted "officials of the central government, the states, as well as the German Railways Company" and "community officials to whom the highest government authority has permitted acquisition without an acquisition permit." Dagmar Ellerbrock, an expert on German gun policies at the Dresden Technical University, told us in 2015 that the Nazis introduced a collective gun license for members of Nazi organizations. One of the main beneficiaries was the paramilitary Sturmabteilung, or brownshirts. After the German parliament, the Reichstag, granted Hitler emergency powers in March 1933, he had a free hand. "Under totalitarian rule, it took just a few weeks to drastically increase the number of Germans who held private weapons," Ellerbock said. An armed member of the Sturmabteilung guards Communists arrested in Berlin following a key parliamentary Nazi victory March 5, 1933. (German Federal Archives via Wikicommons) At the same time, the German state confiscated weapons from Jews, Communists, Social Democrats and unions that refused to affiliate with the Nazi Party. Did the 1928 registration law make this easier? Perhaps, but Ellerbock’s research showed many holes in the system. For the most part, it recorded only new sales, while many people had unregistered weapons dating from World War I. When they came to power, the Nazis used whatever gun records they had to seize weapons from their enemies, but Ellerbock told us the files included very few of the firearms in circulation. "In my records, I found many Jews who well into the late 1930s possessed guns," Ellerbock told us. So registration was spotty, confiscation was selective and Nazi allies found it easier, not harder to get weapons. Much later, in 1938, the Nazis passed a new law that liberalized gun ownership in many respects, while simultaneously banning ownership and manufacture by Jews. June 1934 Simmons brought up June 30, 1934, when Hitler "sent out his secret police and murdered all of his political opponents." That was the night of Operation Hummingbird, Hitler’s crackdown on a very specific group – the Sturmabteilung that he had nurtured and encouraged to intimidate any group that stood in his way. The paramilitary group’s leader Ernst Röhm was eager to consolidate his power, and that set him on a collision course with established leaders in the German military and Hitler’s top advisers. They persuaded Hitler that Röhm was planning a coup. Over a span of several days, Röhm and scores of Sturmabteilung leaders were arrested and executed. The Nazis killed at least 85 people, most but not all associated with Röhm. Specific to Simmons’ remark, the incident had more to do with internecine fighting among the Nazi community than with going after disarmed citizens. Quite the opposite, the Nazi leaders knew full well that they were going up against a group that had plenty of weapons. At one tense moment, a truckload of armed brownshirts drove up to the hotel where Röhm was being arrested. According to Hitler’s chauffeur, Hitler himself walked up to the unit’s leader and told him to "drive back to Munich immediately!' The man complied. Our ruling Simmons said that Hitler "took all the weapons" and had a registry of everyone and then, on the night of June 30, 1934, murdered his political opponents. This oversimplifies and mangles the historic facts. While Hitler did take weapons away from Jews, Communists and Social Democrats, he also armed private citizens to better terrorize those same political opponents. To reduce Nazi gun policy to confiscation of weapons is to miss at least half the story. According to a German historian who has gone through the records, Hitler "drastically increased" the number of privately held weapons. On the confiscation side, she noted that the registry was limited and far from comprehensive. Contrary to what Simmons said, Hitler didn’t take everyone’s weapons and the registry at the time was so incomplete that many Jews retained their weapons. Furthermore, Simmons miscasts the connection between Hitler’s gun policies and the events of June 30, 1934. Far from targeting disarmed leaders, it was a strike at the well-armed pro-Nazi Sturmabteilung. Hitler’s real desire to disarm his opponents doesn’t overcome the flaws in this statement. We rate this claim False. Update (March 7): Simmons responds After we published we heard from Simmons. He told us that when he made his remarks, he was referring to the people Hitler subjugated and killed, primarily the Jews. "I do not believe I am in error," Simmons said. "All Jews were denied the ability to have weapons. They had registries of everyone who was Jewish. And they killed 6 million." Simmons said that on the Senate floor, "you only have so much time and you have to condense things." Videotape of Simmons’ remarks shows no mention of the Jews. The claim we checked is complete and omits no context. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	David Simmons	None	None	None	2018-03-06T11:32:39	2018-03-03	['Adolf_Hitler']
pomt-08404	"Since 2000, when he entered politics, Jon Husted has been on the ballot six times for three different political offices."	true	/ohio/statements/2010/oct/22/maryellen-oshaughnessy/maryellen-oshaughnessy-cites-jon-husteds-election-/	Professional experience in politics, unlike many professions, can be viewed as a negative. Current political ads – whether tapping into voter unrest over the economy or local corruption – are warning voters that supporting experienced candidates will not solve their problems. Maryellen O’Shaughnessy, the Democratic candidate for secretary of state, recently felt the sting of being labeled a "professional politician" in a TV commercial paid for by her opponent, Jon Husted. So O’Shaughnessy responded, calling Husted, a Republican, a "perpetual candidate." "Since 2000, when he entered politics, Jon Husted has been on the ballot six times for three different political offices," O'Shaughnessy said in a news release posted on her campaign website in late September. Because Husted decided to make political experience an issue in the race, we decided to check O’Shaughnessy’s counterclaim about his experience. Husted is currently a state senator representing the Dayton area. Before that, he was a state representative for eight years. For four of those years he was Ohio Speaker of the House. He worked for the Dayton Area Chamber of Commerce before arriving in Columbus as a state legislator. O’Shaughnessy, by comparison, was a member of Columbus City Council from 1998 to 2008. She was elected Franklin County clerk of courts in 2008. She also ran unsuccessfully for Franklin County commissioner in 1992 and 2002 and for Congress in 2000. The Ohio secretary of state, the job Husted and O’Shaughnessy are seeking, is in charge of elections in Ohio and keeps records of candidates and election results. So we checked the secretary of state’s website to see how many times Husted has been on the ballot. We also asked O’Shaughnessy’s campaign to explain its count of instances Husted appeared on a ballot. The secretary of state’s office confirmed O’Shaughnessy’s claim that Husted has been on the ballot six times. He ran for state representative – and won each time – in 2000, 2002, 2004 and 2006. Husted was term-limited after his fourth win, so he ran for state senate, and won, in 2008, according to the secretary of state’s website. In Ohio, state representatives serve two-year terms and senators serve four-year terms. His candidacy this year for secretary of state marks his sixth appearance on the ballot for his third different political office. We find O’Shaughnessy’s statement True.

pomt-13159	"We are seeing kids who are healthier."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/28/hillary-clinton/clinton-says-kids-are-healthier/	When Hillary Clinton holds a rally, it’s usually someone else who introduces her. But at an event in Winston-Salem, N.C., on Oct. 27, it was Clinton who teed up the keynoter, Michelle Obama. It was the first time the current first lady has stumped side-by-side with Clinton, and Clinton was effusive in her praise. She noted Obama’s work on behalf of veterans and young women around the world, and she highlighted Obama’s signature campaign, "Let’s Move." "She has worked for healthier childhood for our kids here at home," Clinton said. "Better nutrition, more exercise and we are seeing the results. We are seeing kids who are healthier." Are America’s kids healthier? We decided to check that out. The first thing to note is that there is no single agreed-upon measure for children’s health. The Clinton campaign pointed us to material on obesity. That’s one yardstick, and while there are some signs of improvement, so far they are limited. The latest government data show that the country has made headway among kids 11 and under, but not among older children. Obesity researcher Ashleley Cockrell Skinner at the Duke University Medical School assessed the data cautiously. "We aren’t seeing significant reductions, but there are not continued increases, especially among young children," Skinner said. The first lady has pushed for healthier eating habits, and there’s encouraging news on that front. The government has the Healthy Eating Index. It measures what people eat against the federal dietary guidelines, as in, are we eating our fruits and vegetables, the right amount of whole grains, and so on. The higher the index, the better. For children 2-17, the index has gone up from 49.5 in 2005-06 to 55.1 in 2011-12. That’s good, but Skinner said that while better diet is important, she’s "not convinced that improving nutrition alone will improve obesity rates." And in any event, Skinner said it would take a long time to see any effect on obesity nationally. By other measures, especially ones that fall outside of Michelle Obama’s work, the trends are negative. We looked at the work of the Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics, a body that dates back to the Clinton administration. The forum posts a number of benchmarks. For adolescent depression, the percentage of youth ages 12–17 who had at least one major depressive episode in the past year rose from 9 percent in 2004 to 11.4 percent in 2014. The fraction of kids 5-17 who had their activities limited due to a chronic condition went from 7 percent in 2000 to 9.3 percent in 2014. Asthma for all children 17 and under increased slightly from 12.3 percent in 2000 to 13.5 percent in 2014, although that could be due to better reporting of the disease. On the other hand, because there is no single measure of children’s health, some researchers see longer term gains. Janet Currie is director of the Center for Health and Wellbeing at Princeton University. Currie looks back to how things stood in 1990. "There have been dramatic reductions in mortality rates among all children," Currie said. "The declines are even greater among poor children than among non-poor children, so that inequality in mortality has declined." Currie also noted that drug and alcohol abuse is down, as is the teen pregnancy rate. Our ruling Clinton said that "we are seeing kids who are healthier." She said that in the context of First Lady Obama’s work on nutrition and exercise, and her campaign staff drew our attention to obesity trends. The latest numbers show less obesity for kids 11 and under, but a continued rise for young teens 12 to 17. As for diet, the government’s index for healthy eating has gone up. On the flip side, several measures such as depression, asthma and curtailed activity are moving in the wrong direction. At best, in the areas that lie at the heart of the first lady’s work, the picture is mixed.

pomt-14059	"The geography of poverty has changed fundamentally in the last 15 years," with more of it concentrated in fragile and conflict states.	mostly true	/global-news/statements/2016/may/23/david-miliband/refugee-aid-head-worlds-poorest-increasingly-found/	Global poverty increasingly is becoming concentrated in areas torn apart by conflict and unrest, International Rescue Committee president David Miliband recently told a Washington, D.C., audience. "43 percent of the world's extreme poor now live in conflict and fragile states," Miliband said May 18, 2016, at the Center for Global Development. Speaking with World Bank president Jim Yong Kim, Miliband made the case for the World Bank to increase its economic development operations. "The mandate of the World Bank is to tackle poverty," Miliband said. "So the geography of poverty has changed fundamentally in the last 15 years." We decided to see if the shift Miliband described is truly under way. It is, though the limited data suggests it’s largely thanks to the success of fighting poverty in non-fragile countries. The clearest evidence comes from this chart in a 2013 Brookings Institution report. As you see, the number of people living in poverty in non-fragile states has declined at a much greater rate than those living in fragile states. Gary Milante, who directs the security and development program for the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, said people should be careful about what they take away from this chart. "Poverty is not becoming concentrated in fragile states because there are more fragile states," Milante said, "rather that fragile states don’t make progress the way the rest of the world does." Be cautious with the data Every expert we reached warned us that while the overall trend is clear, the precise numbers are not. When you think about it, you need two good yardsticks: one for poverty and one for fragility and conflict. And both have to be applied consistently over time. That’s not simple. "The cutoffs for poverty and the methods to estimate household income have shifted over time," said Ben Oppenheim, who co-authored the report that included the 43 percent figure Miliband used. Definitions of a fragile state may have shifted over time as well. Oppenheim and his colleagues used a list from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development which relied partly on an index from the widely cited Fund for Peace. Charles Kenny, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, told us it’s unclear if the Fund for Peace is "measuring the same thing over time." "If Nigeria or Madagascar are added to the list one year, or taken off, you suddenly have spikes or dips of tens of millions of poor, so it would be much more difficult to discern the trends you're talking about," Milante added. The Brookings report, meanwhile, used a fixed list of countries, regardless of whether they moved in and out of state of conflict or fragility. Our ruling Miliband said that the geography of poverty has fundamentally changed in the past 15 years and is increasingly concentrated in conflict and fragile states. Broadly speaking, the numbers back that up -- because non-fragile states are doing a better job of raising people out of poverty. The biggest cautionary note from experts is that we lack consistent measures of fragility and the list can change significantly from year to year. The statement is accurate, but one has to apply it cautiously. We rate this claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a82c1824-f518-499c-bfcc-7b61b9691390	None	David Miliband	None	None	None	2016-05-23T10:50:18	2016-05-17	['None']

A few days after that announcement, Christopher Plante, executive director of National Organization for Marriage - Rhode Island, which opposes gay marriage, was part of a panel on WPRI's "Newsmakers" program, which aired May 1. "I don't believe Gordon Fox had the votes. Our head count showed pretty clearly that they didn't have the votes and he had to make the decision he did," he said. "Similarly, the people of Rhode Island don't want same-sex marriage." NOM-RI has been quick to cite the polls it has commissioned as part of its campaign to press the governor and General Assembly to put the question of gay marriage to a statewide referendum. So we wondered whether any polls show that Rhode Islanders, in fact, don't want same-sex marriage. We called Plante to see if he had any updated numbers. He didn't. He said he was basing his assertion on the belief that a majority of residents had contacted their legislators to object to same-sex marriage, which is why Fox said there weren't enough votes in the House to pass a bill. People who call their legislators don't necessarily reflect the opinion of the general public, just as legislators don't always vote with the majority of their constituents. (In this case, House spokesman Larry Berman told us that the calls coming in to Fox's office "were fairly evenly divided between those in favor of same-sex marriage and those opposed." ) Even opinion polls aren't perfectly reflective because they usually only survey likely voters. But opinion polls are the best indicator we have, so we reviewed recent polls that addressed the issue. NOM-RI itself has done surveys in Rhode Island. In its most recent, in December 2009, respondents were asked: "As far as you are concerned personally, do you favor or oppose same-sex marriage in Rhode Island? And do you feel strongly about this? A majority of those with an opinion actually endorsed same-sex marriage -- 42.6 percent said they strongly or somewhat favored it. Another 32.2 percent strongly or somewhat opposed it -- clearly not a majority, even among those who responded. Just under 23 percent were undecided and the rest had no opinion. That was up from a poll the group conducted six months earlier, when support for gay marriage was 36 percent and opposition was pegged at 43 percent. (In an example of how you can get a different answer if you word the question differently, NOM-RI turned the question on its head in both surveys by asking respondents whether they supported or opposed this statement: "Only marriage between a man and a woman will be valid or recognized in Rhode Island." (In the December 2009 survey, 44.9 percent expressed support for the statement [and, by implication, opposition to gay marriage], 43.6 percent felt the other way, and 9.7 were undecided. But even that question showed a significant increase in support for gay marriage compared to the poll six months earlier, when 52 percent agreed with the anti-gay-marriage statement and 38 percent expressed opposition to it.) Supporters of gay marriage have done their own polling. In a July 2010 poll commissioned by Rhode Island Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders (RI-GLAD), 59 percent of 502 likely voters said they strongly or somewhat favored "allowing gay and lesbian couples to marry legally." Thirty-one percent were somewhat or strongly opposed. In a 2008 RI_GLAD poll, 49 percent favored same-sex marriage; in 2006, 45 percent approved. However, when we looked closer at the 2010 RI-GLAD survey, we found that it initially primed respondents by telling them in an earlier question that, "Churches, clergy and other religious institutions would NOT be required to perform same-sex marriages." That reassurance might have bumped up the approval rating. The only independent Rhode Island poll we found was released by Brown University in May 2009, before the NOM-RI and RI-GLAD polls. Its survey of 593 registered voters found that 60 percent of registered Rhode Islanders expressed support when asked, "Would you support or oppose a law that would allow same-sex couples to get married?" Thirty one percent said they would oppose it. About half of the opposition was hard core - 17 percent said they would even oppose civil unions for gay couples. We mentioned those results to Plante. "Would I repeat that I believe the majority of Rhode Islanders don't want gay marriage? Yeah, I'll repeat that," he said when we spoke with him. "Can I give you a definitive poll that shows that? No." But he also said that his claim is justified because House Speaker Fox couldn't get enough votes for gay marriage in his own chamber. That, he asserted, is because people were "calling their representatives and saying 'We don't want this.' . . . I wasn't making a statistical claim." We disagree. Of course it’s a statistical claim. When you say "the people of Rhode Island don't want same-sex marriage" you're saying that more than 50 percent would oppose such legislation. The most recent polls from Brown, RI-GLAD and even NOM-RI -- Plante’s organization -- show the opposite. Not only did the trends in the NOM-RI and RI-GLAD polls show opposition to same-sex marriage evaporating, the Brown and RI-GLAD polls showed that the public wants gay couples to have the right to marry, even if you assume that every voter who didn't express an opinion was opposed to gay marriage. Plante's assertion isn't just false. It's ridiculous. We rate it Pants On Fire! (To comment or offer your ruling, visit us on Facebook.)

pomt-06707	Says Florida U.S. Reps. Corrine Brown, Alcee Hastings and Frederica Wilson are Socialists.	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2011/sep/02/blog-posting/us-reps-corrine-brown-alcee-hastings-and-frederica/	Word in the blogosphere is that scores of members of Congress are actually unabashed 'S' words. That'd be Socialists. Several bloggers have listed members of Congress by name under headlines like "Why do Americans Keep Electing These Socialist Politicians to Congress??" and "Socialist Party of America Releases The Names of 70 Democrat Members of Congress Who Are Members Of Their Congress." The list -- actually a roster of Congressional Progressive Caucus members (mostly) from Wikipedia -- includes Florida Democrats Corrine Brown, Alcee Hastings and Frederica Wilson. "I'm sure if you asked random people on the street if we had open socialists in the U.S. Congress, they would say – well only Bernie Sanders (Senate). But the right answer is much, much worse," goes an Aug. 12, 2011 post from the website Sovereign Citizens United. On Aug. 17, 2011, citing a different caucus count, Texas radio host Dan Cofall wrote, "The magic number '70' is the number of members of the 111th Congress who are members of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). These are not just politicians who vote left of center; these are card-carrying members of ‘The Democratic Socialists of America’." Our colleagues at PolitiFact Oregon vetted the bloggers' claim in this story, concentrating on Oregonian representatives. They pointed out that Cofall's figure is, for one, out of date because we have entered the 112th Congress. Several out-of-office House members from Florida were listed there. Still, his post targets many existing lawmakers. As our colleagues noted, the posts grabbed our attention for their blunt and far-reaching assertions. At PolitiFact Florida, we wanted to check out the claims that Brown, Hastings and Wilson are Socialists, or if it's a virtual Red Scare. Where did the list come from? Sovereign Citizens United connects the officials to socialism for their membership in the Congressional Progressive Caucus, the largest caucus (75 members) within the House Democratic caucus. Founded in 1991, the group of lawmakers supports policies that advance economic justice, civil rights and liberties, global peace and environmental protection, among other causes on its website. We reached out to Sovereign Citizens United and heard back from a Montgomery, Penn., woman named Ruth Miller. Miller sent us several e-mails to back up her blog post. "It is documented FACT that Socialist Bernie Sanders and Democratic Socialists of America created the Congressional Progressive Caucus in 1991 to further their socialist agenda in the US," she wrote. "Any member of Congress who has joined this caucus expresses solidarity with socialism." Miller sent us to a KeyWiki page about the caucus, which claims that the DSA has worked closely with the progressives and links to an old DSA Detroit group's web page. "As a national organization, DSA joins with its allies in Congress' Progressive Caucus and in many other progressive organizations, fighting for the interests of the average citizen both in legislative struggles and in other campaigns to educate the public on progressive issues and to secure progressive access to the media." Then Miller directed us to Henry Lamb, 73, who penned an undated commentary that inspired her blog post (she included an excerpt there). Lamb, founder of advocacy group Freedom 21 and retired chairman of Sovereignty International, said he wrote the essay to show "how similar the organizations were at the time." Lamb wrote: "Socialism in America is alive, well, and growing. Aided by such influential Congressmen as John Conyers, Ranking Member of the House Judicial Committee, David Bonior, the pit-bull-dog who successfully whipped Newt, Maxine Waters, the President's outspoken defender in the impeachment debates, and nearly 60 other Representatives, socialism is advancing in America behind the 'Progressive' label." He goes on to pull excerpts from the Democratic Socialists of America website that explain what the group believes. In a hot pink sidebar, Lamb listed 56 members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. It includes Brown and Hastings but not Wilson, as she was not yet elected to the House. There's also no analysis of the Progressive Caucus. His piece contains no date, and Lamb -- to whom we spoke -- could not find it in his online archives. So are they Socialists? Neither Brown nor Wilson's office responded to calls and e-mails for comment. A spokeswoman for Hastings e-mailed only to say he was not a member of the Progressive Caucus, which is true -- this year. News accounts show he has been a member in the past. Still, all three are serving as Democrats. All three list their political party affiliation as the Florida Democratic Party on their voter registration cards. Brad Bauman, executive director of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said none of the group's members are Socialists. "The members of Congress on our caucus are patriots who have chosen to serve," Bauman said, "and to allege that they are not is just simply ridiculous." Even the Democratic Socialists of America does not claim the caucus members. PolitiFact Oregon interviewed the party's past national director of 10 years, Frank Llewellyn, who called the list "completely fraudulent." More from PolitiFact Oregon: There is not one member of Congress who is a formal member of the DSA, Llewellyn said. In order to join, a person must fill out a form and pay dues. Even Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, is not a formal member of the DSA, Llewellyn said. The last member of Congress who was an actual card-carrying member, he said, was California Democratic Rep. Ron Dellums, who served 28 years in the House until leaving in 1998. In a separate interview with PolitiFact Georgia, Llewellyn said the DSA had nothing to do with the creation of the caucus and would "prefer an alternative third party that supports its values." He outlined a couple policy differences with the progressives in Congress. He said his organization wants larger cuts in military spending and federal income tax rates returned to pre-Reagan administration levels, when they were much higher for the rich. But what about Lamb, the man who wrote untold years ago that "socialism is advancing in America behind the "Progressive" label"? He said it isn't wise to generalize. The name-calling reminds him of recent comments from Rep. Andre Carson, D-Ind., who said some of his tea party colleagues would like to see blacks "hanging from a tree." "I think it would be equally silly for somebody to say that every member of the Progressive Caucus is a Socialist, even though you would have to share similar philosophies with socialist beliefs to sign up," Lamb said. "That doesn't mean necessarily that you are a Socialist." Our ruling You've heard it from the Congressional Progressive Caucus, the Democratic Socialists of America and the author of the commentary that inspired the blog activity: Just because you are a member of the Progressive Caucus does not mean you are a socialist. And none of the caucus members profess to be Socialists, including our Florida Democrats, Brown, Hastings and Wilson. The bloggers go too far in attacking them as socialists, a repeated label for liberals these days. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-14647	"Two million new jobs have been created," in California since 2011.	true	/california/statements/2016/jan/25/jerry-brown/brown-speaks-truth-about-californias-job-growth/	Near the end of his 2016 State of the State address, Gov. Jerry Brown claimed: "two million new jobs have been created," in California since 2011. That’s a lot of new employment, we thought, especially for a state ranked by some as having the nation’s worst business climate, thanks to high taxes and regulation. Brown has staked his legacy, at least during his second stint in the governor’s office, largely on what he calls the "California comeback." We decided to fact check his claim about job creation, which is a big part of that comeback. From 2007 to 2010, California lost more than a million jobs when the state’s housing and construction sectors collapsed. The loss of tax revenue and past skimpy savings meant multi-billion dollar budget shortfalls for California. It also meant heavy cuts in services for the poor, shuttering state parks and allowing levees, bridges and highways to crumble. In his speech at the state Capitol, Brown took some credit for the financial turnaround, noting that he’s helped pay down huge debts and create the state’s Rainy Day Fund. He didn’t take all the credit for the new jobs. "Two million new jobs have been created and unemployment has dropped in half," since 2011, he said in his record 14th State of the State address. "Of course, the global recovery has a lot to do with that. So, we should applaud, but we can’t control it, too." We’ll leave the global impact on California’s recovery as a question for another day. Our focus is on Brown’s comment that "two million jobs have been created" since 2011, the year he returned to the governor’s office, and more than two decades after his initial stretch as the state’s top executive. Crunching the job numbers Sifting through jobs data can be dizzying. And there are many ways to look at the numbers. For some guidance, we turned to Chapman University economist Esmael Adibi, who tracks state employment. Adibi pointed to "nonfarm payroll jobs" tracked monthly by the state and federal governments. Economists consider that category the most reliable because it eliminates farm employment, which fluctuates considerably. Everyone in the nonfarm category is listed on a payroll and considered an employee. Data from that category show that California had 14,301,300 nonfarm jobs in January 2011, when Brown’s third term started. A report released the day after Brown’s address shows the state had more than 16,320,100 of those jobs in December 2015. That’s a growth of just over two million jobs. Experts we spoke with said this is a ‘net job creation’ total. And because many jobs were also lost during this period, the gross number of positions created would have been well over two million. "I believe the governor is correct," Adibi told us. "The economy actually has done pretty good during his leadership." For some perspective, the two million jobs created in California accounts for about one-sixth of the nation’s net 12.4 million jobs added during the same period, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics. It’s also roughly 600,000 more jobs than Texas added during the same period, the federal labor data show. Texas officials, including former Gov. Rick Perry, have made repeated efforts to siphon jobs away from the Golden State. Asked for the source of information for the California governor’s job creation claim, the Brown Administration pointed to the same non-farm payroll data as Adibi. Our ruling In his State of the State address, Gov. Jerry Brown said "two million jobs have been created" in California since 2011. The most reliable data used by both independent economists and the Brown Administration show California had about 14.3 million nonfarm payroll jobs when the governor returned to office in January 2011 and just over 16.3 million jobs last month. That’s a net growth of more than two million jobs. We rate the governor’s claim True.

pomt-01067	The state covered a smaller percentage of the cost of K-12 education in 2013 than it did in 2002.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2015/jan/20/claire-suggs/analyst-target-education-spending/	Years of state austerity cuts have forced many of the state’s 180 local school districts to furlough or cut employees, increase class sizes and shorten their school years. But they’ve also contributed to a shift in the costs for K-12 education, Claire Suggs, an education policy analyst with the left-leaning Georgia Budget & Policy Institute, said Jan. 9. The state was picking up 56 percent of those costs in Fiscal Year 2002, the year before the austerity cuts began, and only 51 percent in Fiscal 2013, Suggs told reporters at the Georgia Partnership for Excellence in Education’s Media Symposium. "We are relying much more on local and federal dollars," she said. We decided to fact-check Suggs’ statement, given Gov. Nathan Deal’s announcement last week that he expects a major overhaul of the state’s 30-year school funding formula, the Quality Basic Education (QBE) Act of 1985, to be completed and in place for the 2016-2017 school year. Education funding was one of the hot topics of last year’s governor’s race, largely because of those austerity cuts, which started in 2003 under Gov. Sonny Perdue, continued through the recession and Deal’s first four-year term and have cumulatively amounted to more than $8 billion across all school systems. Jason Carter, the Democratic nominee for governor, said the cuts devastated schools and blamed Deal. Deal’s comeback was that Carter voted for three, back-to-back $1 billion austerity cuts and against the 2015 budget with the smallest cut to education in years. With that background, we delve into the numbers. Records from the state Department of Education shows that K-12 education costs totalling about $10.4 billion in Fiscal 2002 were split three ways: with 56 percent covered by the state, 38 percent by locals and 6 percent by the federal government. Fast forward to the Fiscal 2013, the costs for K-12 education were $14.2 billion, and the split was 51 percent state funds, 41 percent local and 8 percent federal. That means Suggs was on target when she said the state’s share of school funding was down 5 percent to 51 percent in 2013, compared to 56 percent in 2002. We also examined K-12 spending for the years in between and saw plenty of fluctuation. For example, the state’s share fell to 51 percent as early as 2004 and to 43 percent at one point. The budget was propped up for a time by $1 billion in federal stimulus and held steady at 51 percent in Fiscal 2013 and 2014. Data isn’t yet available for Fiscal 2015 to see whether the percentage will change based on the decision by Deal and the General Assembly to reduce the current austerity cut to $749 million. That reduction was celebrated by local school districts, a majority of which qualify for extra state money each year as "low wealth" districts. Joe Martin, a longtime education advocate who helped develop the current funding formula, said that, when state funding declines, locals are usually left, with two options: make up the difference or cut instructional programs. "This isn’t easy for any school system, but the systems with a low tax base per student are left in a terrible predicament," said Martin via email from Macedonia, where he’s currently serving in the Peace Corps. These districts "never had much to begin with, compared with the systems that have much greater resources, but they are simply unable to close the gap," Martin said. Mike Griffin, senior policy analyst with the Education Commission of the States in Denver, said state funding generally decreased for public education nationally during the Great Recession as it did in smaller economic downturns in the 1980s and 1990s. Some states swapped out federal stimulus dollars for state dollars when they became available to fund education, although they shouldn’t have, Griffin said. "When those federal dollars started to fade, some states weren’t in good enough shape to replace them," he said. Our conclusion: Suggs was accurate to say that the percentage of state funding for K-12 education was higher in 2002 than it was in 20013. To her larger point, the federal and local governments also have been paying larger shares through these years. But several factors were at play: the recession, the austerity cuts, the stimulus money. The austerity cut is smaller this year than in several years. That’s needed context.

pomt-12027	"African Americans in Missouri are 75 percent more likely to be stopped and searched by law enforcement officers than caucasians."	half-true	/missouri/statements/2017/sep/18/derrick-johnson/naacp-president-partially-accurate-stops-and-searc/	The first travel advisory in the history of the NAACP was issued Aug. 2 for the state of Missouri over concerns about the safety of African Americans, and once again tensions between law enforcement officers, state officials and minorities were thrust into the spotlight. The advisory, originally set to expire Aug. 28, was renewed, according to The New York Times. Missouri NAACP President Rod Chapel said it will remain in effect until at least late September. When NAACP Interim President and CEO Derrick Johnson announced the organization’s travel advisory, he cited statistics that depict racial disparities in Missouri. "The numerous racist incidents, and the statistics cited by the Missouri Attorney General in the advisory, namely the fact that African Americans in Missouri are 75 percent more likely to be stopped and searched by law enforcement officers than Caucasians, are unconscionable, and are simply unacceptable in a progressive society," Johnson said in the statement. The advisory was issued largely in response to SB 43, which requires employees who claim workplace discrimination prove bias is an explicit reason for being fired, rather than just a contributing factor. It was also in response to a "series of questionable, race-based incidents occurring statewide recently." We wanted to look into Johnson’s statement about racial disparities in Missouri. Are law enforcement officers a full 75 percent more likely to pull over and search an African American? Stops versus searches When we reached out to the NAACP, communications director Malik Russell said Johnson may have gotten some of his numbers mixed up, since he didn’t have the data in front of him. But he emphasized the larger point, saying the difference between the numbers that he might have mixed up is small. Russell didn’t give any additional evidence, but the statement announcing the advisory cited data from the attorney general’s office. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com In 2000, concerns from both Missouri residents and the legislature prompted the passage of a law that requires law enforcement officers collect specific information, including race, for every traffic stop. Each agency must provide this data to the attorney general, who in turn sends it to the governor. A team of researchers has been compiling this information for the attorney general since 2001. The 2016 Vehicle Stops Report Executive Summary from the attorney general’s office breaks down the data related to vehicle stops last year. There were 21 agencies that did not submit the data by the required date and 58 agencies that reported no stops out of 682 law enforcement agencies in the state. Blacks represent 10.9 percent of the driving population and 18 percent of all traffic stops, while whites represent 82.8 percent of the population and 78 percent of stops. Richard Rosenfeld, a criminology professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, has been on the research team since 2001. Rosenfeld said the researchers divided stops made by the number of people 16 years and older in the state to come up with a "stop rate." A value of one means there is no disparity, values greater than one mean there is overrepresentation, and values below one mean there is underrepresentation. The disparity index, which is the proportion of stops divided by the proportion of the population, was 1.65 for blacks last year, overrepresenting the black population by 65 percent. Whites, on the other hand, were stopped at a .94 rate, underrepresenting the white population by 6 percent. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Researchers divided 1.65 by .94 to get 1.75, or a 75 percent higher stop rate for blacks than whites. This is the number Johnson used in his statement. But stops and searches are different things. Blacks are 57 percent more likely to be searched than whites. (Formula: 8.77 percent search rate for blacks divided by 5.57 search rate for whites = 1.57.) Our ruling Johnson stated that African Americans in Missouri are 75 percent more likely to be stopped and searched by law enforcement officers than caucasians. Blacks in Missouri are 75 percent more likely to be stopped by law enforcement officers than whites, which is reflected in the attorney general data. That’s not true about searches. Blacks are 57 percent more likely to be searched than whites. The discrepancy in searches is huge, but it’s not 75 percent. We rate Johnson’s statement Half True.

pomt-00070	Says Tony Evers wants to give in-state tuition and drivers licenses to "illegal aliens."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/nov/02/scott-walker/walker-scores-illegal-aliens-claim-against-evers/	In a TV ad launched days before the Nov. 6, 2018, election, Republican Gov. Scott Walker went after his Democratic opponent on immigration. The spot — released Oct. 23 — dings Tony Evers on taxes before saying the longtime state schools superintendent "wants to give in-state tuition to illegal aliens … and driver’s licenses, too." The ad includes clips of Evers taken from the Oct. 19, 2018, debate sponsored by the Wisconsin Broadcasters Association. They show Evers saying he would support legislation "that would allow DACA students … to have in-state tuition," and that he supports driver’s licenses "for undocumented folks." Do those clips justify the ad’s summary that Evers supports tuition and licenses for "illegal aliens?" Let’s take a closer look. Defining the terms The truth of this claim hinges on the definition of a few different immigration terms, notably "illegal alien." That’s the preferred verbiage by many on the right for undocumented immigrants. Whatever the term, it refers to people who entered or reside in the country in violation of the law -- such as without visas or passports. Our colleagues at PolitiFact Texas found the term "illegal alien" crops up a few times in federal law, mostly in section headings, but it is never officially defined. Similar terms are used -- and defined -- by the federal government, however. For instance, the IRS defines "undocumented alien" as one "who entered the United States illegally without the proper authorization and documents, or who entered the United States legally and has since violated the terms of his or her visa or overstayed the time limit." Meanwhile, the tuition question focuses specifically on DACA, or Deferred Action Childhood Arrivals, a program that has been in the news since President Donald Trump’s administration took steps to end it a year ago. Federal courts have so far halted that effort. Those protected under DACA are often referred to as "Dreamers." The U.S. Department of Homeland Security program launched DACA in 2012 under President Barack Obama to allow certain people who came to the country illegally as children to request a two-year deferral of immigration action. It also allows them to legally work. DACA status, which is granted at the discretion of prosecutors, is open to people who: Were under age 31 as of June 2012 Came to the U.S. prior to their 16th birthday Have lived in the U.S. continually since at least June 2007 Were in the U.S. in June 2012 and had no lawful status then Are currently in school, have graduated from high school, have obtained a GED or have been honorably discharged from the Armed Forces Have not been convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor, or three or more other misdemeanors With that background, let’s look at the two parts of the claim in more detail. Evers on in-state tuition In the debate, Evers was asked whether DACA students should get in-state tuition. Evers’ response: "I would propose or support legislation that would allow DACA students to be a part of, to have in-state tuition." Former Gov. Jim Doyle signed a measure in 2009 allowing undocumented students to pay in-state tuition at public universities if they graduated from high school here, but Walker repealed that in 2011. As noted, those with DACA status have met certain criteria to be recognized by the government and, as such, would not face immediate deportation. But DACA students by definition are those who are in this country without proper documentation, even if they were brought here by their parents as young children. DACA allows the person to defer immigration action but "does not provide lawful status," according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. And that’s not a position unique to the present administration. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, under Obama, defined DACA immigrants as part of the group that should be counted as "unauthorized resident immigrant population." Evers on driver’s licenses This statement is pretty clear cut. From Evers during the debate: "Do I think that we should have permits, driver permits for undocumented folks that are working in the state of Wisconsin? The answer is yes. Undocumented folks are working hard at jobs all across the state of Wisconsin, paying taxes, paying Social Security. They should have the opportunity … to have permits." Evers said an added benefit is that requiring a permit means undocumented residents "have to learn how to drive safely in Wisconsin." Evers uses "undocumented" instead of the "illegal aliens" term the Walker ad invokes, but the terms are substantially similar in common usage. Currently, someone in the country illegally cannot get a driver’s license in Wisconsin, though immigrants who have obtained the DACA designation can, said Davorin Odrcic, a Milwaukee immigration attorney. Our rating Walker claims in a TV ad that Evers supports granting driver’s licenses and in-state tuition for "illegal aliens." Walker is clearly on point on the driver’s license issue. As for in-state tuition for DACA students, Evers backs that, too. There is a wrinkle though, in that those with DACA status have met certain criteria to be recognized by the government and, as such, would not face immediate deportation. That said, by definition they are not in the country legally. Their DACA status delays official action against them, but it doesn’t change the lack of legal status. So the statement is accurate, but it requires some clarification and detail on DACA status. That’s our definition of Mostly True.

pomt-11069	"There's been a 1,700 percent increase in asylum claims over the last 10 years."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jun/21/donald-trump/1700-percent-increase-asylum-claims/	President Donald Trump argued that immigrants entering illegally are gaming the American immigration system, citing a remarkable rise in asylum applications. He said some asylum seekers are actually abusing the process with criminal intentions. "There's been a 1,700 percent increase in asylum claims over the last 10 years," Trump said in a June 19 speech. "Think of that. Think of that. We're a great country but you can't do that. Smugglers know how the system works. They game the system; they game it." Has there been a 1,700 percent increase in asylum claims? The numbers stack up. But the claims of gaming the system are less supported. Trump is talking about "credible fear" cases, which is spelled out in the Refugee Act of 1980. It's available for people unable or unwilling to return to their home country "because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion." Migrants who are apprehended or unable to enter the country legally can claim "credible fear" in order to get a hearing before an immigration court. The Homeland Security Department tracks cases in which a decision to grant a hearing has been made, which differs only slightly from the number of all claims made. In 2007, 5,171 people claimed credible fear and had their cases reviewed. In 2016, it was 91,786. That represents a 1,675 percent hike, basically as Trump claimed. Between 60 and 80 percent of those cases were approved for further court review. Overall, 20 percent of applicants were ultimately granted asylum in fiscal year 2017, the Homeland Security Department told us. Not necessarily gaming the system But that doesn’t mean asylum seekers are gaming the system. The majority have valid claims of fear in their home countries, experts told us. Louis Desipio, a University of California Irvine political science professor who specializes in immigration, told us that while more people are affirmatively expressing their right to apply for asylum, their claims are not necessarily without merit. "Initially, a lot of migration was single males from Mexico coming for work, and now you’re seeing a shift to Central American families fleeing record levels of violence in the northern triangle" of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, said Joshua Breisblatt, a senior policy analyst at the American Immigration Council. "There is no indication that that’s an increase in fraud, that’s just something that is happening in the United States’ backyard." Asylum requests by citizens of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras made up 72.9 percent of total claims in fiscal year 2016. "Our laws are clear," said Kate Voigt, associate director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association. "If you express a fear of returning to your home country, you have a right to a credible fear screening. If the asylum officer finds you have a credible fear of persecution in your home country, then you have a right to have an immigration judge hear your case." Under the last several administrations, Customs and Border Protection increased its use of expedited removal, according to Lenni B. Benson, a law professor at New York Law School. Given the only way to stop an expedited removal order is to seek a credible fear review, Benson said this might explain the hike in numbers. As we noted, the overall grant rate for all asylum applications nationwide was 20 percent in fiscal year 2017, a percentage hasn’t changed much since 2012. But Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, a professor at George Mason University’s Schar School of Policy and Government who has interviewed hundreds of migrants for immigration research, said the variation in numbers between case approvals and asylum application approvals does not prove fraud, either. In order to get their cases of asylum initially approved, immigrants arriving illegally must fill out a survey to show whether their conditions qualify under the definition of persecution. In order to prove they merit asylum, they must show evidence they often lack before a court. The United States has also narrowed its standards for asylum under Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Desipio said, precluding victims of domestic abuse and gang violence from qualifying for asylum. "It’s very complicated for these people," Correa said. "How, if they are in the United States after that very difficult journey, are they going to prove they have been extorted, show that their kids have been recruited by gangs?" Correa said there are definitely cases of fraud by smugglers who attempt to reunite children with their parents. But there are also families fleeing situations of extreme insecurity. Our ruling Trump said, "There's been a 1,700 percent increase in asylum claims over the last 10 years." There was a 1,675 percent increase in asylum claims reviewed by the Homeland Security Department from 2008 to 2017. But that does not evidence fraud, as Trump suggested. Record levels of violence and persecution abroad largely explain the rise in asylum claims, experts told us. While the percentage of individuals whose asylum claims are approved by the Justice Department is relatively low, it might be explained by the much higher bar set by a court appearance than the completion of a survey. We rate this claim Mostly True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2018-06-21T10:05:55	2018-06-19	['None']
pomt-03039	Because of the 2011 debt ceiling fight, "the stock market lost 2,000 points."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/08/charles-schumer/charles-schumer-says-dow-jones-lost-2000-points-af/	If the nation hits the debt ceiling later this month without it being raised by Congress, economists predict a wide spread of economic harm: higher interest rates, lower economic growth and plunging consumer confidence in the United States and overseas. One particularly high-profile sign of economic distress would be a plummeting Dow Jones Industrial Average. During an appearance on ABC’s This Week With George Stephanopoulos, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., cited that scenario as one of the reasons why Congress should take action soon. Stephanopoulos asked Schumer whether both sides were "posturing" and "playing with fire" on the debt ceiling, which is the legal limit to how much debt the government can shoulder. Schumer said, "You don't negotiate over something like the debt ceiling because --" at which point Stephanopoulos interjected, "Other presidents have done it." Schumer responded, "No. The one time that it was really done in this kind of way, (when it wasn’t just) a deadline and you had to decide (on) abortion or something else, was in 2011. We went right up to the deadline. The stock market lost 2,000 points, $18 billion was lost by the American people." We wondered whether Schumer was right about the stock market losing 2,000 points. So we looked at historical data for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the most popular measure of the stock market. On July 21, 2011, the Dow reached 12,724 -- its high point in the months immediately preceding the debt ceiling fight. For the next 10 days, Congress squabbled over raising the debt ceiling. Then, between July 31 and Aug. 2, the White House and congressional leaders reached and implemented a deal that became known as the Budget Control Act of 2011. By Aug. 2, when the crisis was effectively over, the Dow stood at 11,866, a drop of 858 points. That’s less than the 2,000 points Schumer cited. However, the Dow continued to tumble for another two months, due in large part to repercussions of the debt ceiling debate, particularly the downgrading of the United States’ credit rating by Standard & Poors on Aug. 5. By Oct. 3, the Dow had bottomed out at 10,655 -- a decline of 2,069 points from its pre-debt ceiling peak, and its lowest level in about a year. So if you include the aftershocks of the debt ceiling fight, Schumer is correct that the Dow fell by 2,000 points. (You can see the decline as a line chart here.) That said, it’s also worth noting that the recovery was almost as quick as the decline. It took only until Jan. 25, 2012 -- about three and a half months after the low point -- for all of the pre-debt ceiling losses to be recouped. By Jan. 25, the Dow hit 12,758. And as Schumer was speaking on This Week, the most recent Dow close was 15,072 -- an 18 percent increase over the pre-debt ceiling high, which had been about two years and three months earlier. Matt House, a spokesman for Schumer, said the Dow’s subsequent recovery is irrelevant. "Of course (the Dow) came back, but that is of little comfort to anyone who was at or nearing retirement during those several months," he said. "With 10,000 baby boomers retiring a day, that drop is incredibly important, and not to be trivialized. .... And this is all from a default that didn’t happen." Still, we think it’s important to note that the 2,000 points the Dow lost didn’t stay off for years, or even permanently, as some viewers might assume. Our rating Schumer said that because of the 2011 debt ceiling fight, "the stock market lost 2,000 points." If you count the aftermath of the deal that avoided a debt ceiling breach, which included a historic downgrade of the United States’ creditworthiness rating, then Schumer is right that the Dow fell by 2,000 points. Still, Schumer makes it sound as if the drop happened right away. Actually, it dropped at the time of fight and continued to drop for another two months after the United States' credit rating was downgraded. We rate Schumer’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-00560	Says Hillary Clinton's "been very clear where she stands on trade."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/14/john-podesta/hillary-clinton-has-been-very-clear-trade-campaign/	One might expect that as a former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton would have well-defined views on the ongoing fight over President Barack Obama’s trade agenda. But critics of the Democratic presidential candidate -- even within her own party -- have chastised Clinton for taking a vague position on the debate over the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement. Democrats are deeply divided over the deal, primarily over whether Congress should accept legislative procedures that would make it easier to approve a deal amid concerns regarding American workers and the environment. "Surely, a person who was secretary of state understands something about American leadership," said Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., on Fox News Sunday June 14. "And to refuse to even take a position (on TPP) is just sort of mystifying to me." Clinton’s supporters, meanwhile, say there’s nothing mystifying about Clinton’s position. Here’s how Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta explained it to Meet the Press’ Chuck Todd. "She’s been very clear on where she stands on trade," Podesta said, noting that Clinton has said a trade agreement must protect workers and national security. "But the agreement’s not final, so when it is final, she’ll render a judgement on that. She’s stated her concerns, but she’s got a clear standard that it’s got to be good for American workers or she thinks the United States should walk away from it." We decided to take a look at Clinton’s comments on trade from the campaign so far and see if she has expressed a "very clear" stance -- a sentiment echoed by Clinton campaign hands Robby Mook and Karen Finney, also on the June 14 political talk shows. Recent comments To a certain extent, Clinton has laid out where she stands on trade in general in recent months, but she has avoided saying whether she definitively supports the pending deal and the fast-track trade authority many believe is necessary to make the deal happen. Here’s a selection of her recent comments, starting with the most recent: June 14 at an Iowa rally: Just a few hours after the morning shows, Clinton said Obama should "work with his allies in Congress" to ensure better protection for workers and "to make sure we get the best, strongest deal possible." Even though she urged them to make some changes to the deal, she didn’t specify the exact changes, nor did explicitly express overall support or disapproval. May 22 at a New Hampshire press conference: Clinton said she has some questions about the TPP, regarding the potential for currency manipulation and the controversial investor-settlement-dispute mechanism, as well as health and environmental concerns. "I've been for trade agreements, I've been against trade agreements, voted for some, voted against others, so I want to judge this when I see exactly what exactly is in it and whether or not I think it meets my standards," she said. May 19 at a small business lending roundtable: "I've said over and over again any trade deal that I will support must increase jobs, must increase wages, must give us more economic competitive power around the world to sell our products and must be good for our national security." April 17 statement: A campaign spokesman said Clinton would be watching the TPP "closely" to make sure it meets her standards. He said, "Hillary Clinton believes that any new trade measure has to pass two tests: First, it should put us in a position to protect American workers, raise wages and create more good jobs at home. Second, it must also strengthen our national security. We should be willing to walk away from any outcome that falls short of these tests. The goal is greater prosperity and security for American families, not trade for trade’s sake." So Clinton has said she supports trade under certain conditions, though she hasn’t really said anything that shows how she would vote if she was still a member of the Senate today. Namely, she hasn’t said whether or not she would vote to grant Obama fast-track trade promotion authority, the legislative maneuver that would make it easier to pass a trade deal -- currently the main source of Democrat infighting over trade. Speaking about TPP in a 2014 Council on Foreign Relations interview, Clinton briefly talked about fast track, saying only that she thought it was "not likely" that Congress would grant Obama the authority. But she said that she hoped the administration would be able to convince Congress and the American people that it’s critical for the American economy to address "border barriers to our products" so that the deal could pass even without fast track. Before the campaign Before Clinton’s 2016 campaign officially launched -- and also before the trade fight heated up -- Clinton made statements that showed general support for TPP, even saying that the deal as it stood then satisfied many of her concerns. In her 2014 memoir Hard Choices, Clinton wrote that she didn’t want to definitively give support for the trade deal before the details are all hammered out -- but she still called it the "signature economic pillar of our strategy in Asia." She said the deal lowered "trade barriers while raising standards on labor, the environment, and intellectual property. ... It was also important for American workers, who would benefit from competing on a more level playing field. And it was a strategic initiative that would strengthen the position of the United States in Asia." Speaking in Australia in 2012, she said the "TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field. And when negotiated, this agreement will cover 40 percent of the world's total trade and build in strong protections for workers and the environment." It’s also interesting to note Clinton’s 2008 campaign position on pending trade deals -- much more defined than her current position on TPP -- and how they changed when she joined the Obama administration. For example, in an April 2008 speech where she discussed a proposed trade agreement with Colombia, she said, "As I have said for months, I oppose the deal. I have spoken out against the deal, I will vote against the deal, and I will do everything I can to urge the Congress to reject the Colombia Free Trade Agreement." But as secretary of state in 2010, she said of the same deal: "First, let me underscore President Obama's and my commitment to the Free Trade Agreement. We are going to continue to work to obtain the votes in the Congress to be able to pass it. We think it's strongly in the interests of both Colombia and the United States." Our ruling Podesta said Hillary Clinton has been "very clear on where she stands on trade." While you can argue that clear is a bit of a subjective term, it’s hard for any neutral person to say Clinton has been clear about trade, particularly in the context of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Clinton has avoided answering whether she supports grants Obama fast-track trade promotion authority, which is seen as the linchpin to cutting a trade deal in Asia. Clinton has said what she would like in an ideal trade deal in terms of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. But she has yet to say definitively whether or not Obama’s pending trade deal meets her standards -- though she has admitted some provisions could use improvement. This is a change from just a couple years ago, when she seemed more supportive than not of the pending trade deal. Does any of this sound "very clear" to you? We’ll concede a little wiggle room based on Podesta’s wording. But that’s about it. We rate this claim Mostly False.	None	John Podesta	None	None	None	2015-06-14T18:18:59	2015-06-14	['None']
pomt-06813	Says GOP recall challenger Kim Simac "was delinquent paying her property taxes eight of the last nine years."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/aug/12/greater-wisconsin-political-fund/greater-wisconsin-political-fund-says-recall-candi/	In July 2011, when allies of state Sen. Jim Holperin (D-Conover) hit his recall challenger, Republican Kim Simac, for failing to pay income taxes, Simac punched back -- metaphorically speaking, of course. Simac accused her foes of believing that struggling small-business owners such as she are "too poor to run for public office." She blamed the troubles of her horse-training business, Great Northern Adventure Co., on the poor economy, and said she had no tax liability to pay. The tax attack on Simac, a party activist and founder of the Northwoods Patriots, continued a few weeks later, when a union-backed group, the Greater Wisconsin Political Fund, launched a TV ad. That ad says Simac, who has campaigned for a property tax freeze, had no credibility on the topic of taxes given her personal record. In addition to other taxes, the ad focused on property tax payments on the home Simac co-owns on the 22-acre horse ranch, saying she was "was delinquent paying her property taxes eight of the last nine years." To get to the bottom of the deliquency claim, we first asked the Greater Wisconsin Political Fund and the related Greater Wisconsin Committee to provide their basis for the claim. Greater Wisconsin is funded by labor and Democratic Party groups and wealthy individual donors. The Greater Wisconsin Committee has been running a pro-Holperin ad in the district in northern Wisconsin. The group referred us to a WAOW-TV online story July 28, 2011 that reported a pattern of delinquencies. The story said Simac "paid all outstanding property tax bills in June." After organizing the recall against Holperin, Simac announced her intention to run in early May. Simac campaign spokesman Matt Capristo told us Simac was never behind on her payments under Wisconsin law. Let’s take a look. We turned to the Vilas County treasurer’s office, which has the detail on tax payments on two properties Simac owns: a Town of Lincoln home on the horse ranch, and an undeveloped property in the City of Eagle River. On the home and ranch -- valued at $242,000 and co-owned with her husband, Arthur -- Simac was delinquent in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009 and 2010, according to records reviewed for us by Deputy Treasurer Peggy Cleveland. She paid on time in 2008. The late payments typically involved missing the January 31 deadline. That’s when, under state law, taxes are due in full or the first of two installments must be made. In most cases, Simac paid up later in the same year. The exception was 2002 and 2003, which Simac didn’t pay until May 2004, Cleveland said. Simac was charged -- and paid -- interest on the delinquent payments. On the second property, the frequency of delinquent payments was exactly the same. In 2006, she paid taxes that were due in 2004 and 2005. In Simac’s defense, Capristo said the cash flow of her tourist-related business made it impossible for her to pay in January. "She pays it when she gets it," he said. As for the timing of her payments, Capristo said property taxes are really not due in full until July 31 -- the legal deadline for the second installment payment. He added that he understood that Simac paid her taxes in time to meet that July 31 date. But according to Vilas County tax officials, the legal deadline to pay all or at least the first installment is Jan. 31. That point is clearly backed up by state statutes and other treasurer’s offices and is stated on homeowners tax bills. Here is a typical warning, this from a City of Milwaukee property tax bill: "WARNING: If the first installment payment is not paid by the due date, the installment option is lost. The total tax becomes delinquent and is subject to interest and penalty charges." Beyond that, the records show it’s not nearly the case Simac that made her payments in every instance by July 31 of the given year, as her aide claimed. On the property containing her home, which is the focus of the TV ad, she was two years late at one point, and made other second installments in August and November, Cleveland said records show. Three times, she made a timely January installment but was late on the second. Five times, she missed January altogether. Records show Simac is all paid up for 2010, though she missed the January deadline on her main property. She paid in full on June 14, 2011. Her bill was $1,992 in taxes and $99 in interest. The bottom line? The Greater Wisconsin Committee went after recall challenger Kim Simac for having delinquent property taxes in eight of the last nine years. Public records backed that claim. Indeed, Simac’s own understanding of the law, as articulated by her campaign, was off. We rate the group’s claim True.

pomt-06420	"In 2008, when Flint had 265 sworn officers on their police force, there were 35 murders and 91 rapes in this city. In 2010, when Flint had only 144 police officers, the murder rate climbed to 65, and rapes … climbed to 229."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/25/joe-biden/update-joe-biden-says-murders-and-rapes-increased/	Editor’s note: When we first examined this statement from Vice President Joe Biden, we rated his statement Mostly True. We noted in that report, published Oct. 20, 2011, that the numbers he gave for rapes seemed questionable. Shortly afterwards, we explained why our original report was at odds with other independent fact-checkers in a story, "When fact-checkers disagree." We also asked for reaction from readers. Since then, we found more definitive evidence that Biden's numbers on rape are wrong. We have re-reported this item and given it a new rating of Half True. We have also archived our original report with the Mostly True rating. If Congress doesn’t pass President Barack Obama’s jobs plan, crimes like rape and murder will go up as cops are laid off, says Vice President Joe Biden. It’s a stark talking point. But Biden hasn’t backed down in the face of challenges during the past week, citing crime statistics and saying, "Look at the facts." In a confrontation with a conservative blogger on Oct. 19, Biden snapped, "Don’t screw around with me." We were intrigued by comments Biden made in Flint, Mich., on Oct. 12, 2011: "In 2008, when Flint had 265 sworn officers on their police force, there were 35 murders and 91 rapes in this city. "In 2010, when Flint had only 144 police officers, the murder rate climbed to 65, and rapes, just to pick two categories, climbed to 229. "In 2011, you now only have 125 shields. God only knows what the numbers will be this year for Flint if we don't rectify it. And God only knows what that number would have been had we not been able to get a little bit of help to you." We looked at Biden’s crime numbers and turned to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Statistics to confirm them. But the federal numbers aren’t the same as the numbers Biden cited. (Several of our readers did the same thing; we received several requests to check Biden’s numbers.) What’s going on here? We asked Biden’s office, and they said they got the numbers from the city of Flint. For the sake of clarity, we’ll look at the murder numbers first and then turn to the rape numbers. Murders in Flint Our research showed murders are an acknowledged problem in the city of Flint. The Flint Journal reported that murders in the city reached a historic high of 66 in 2010, with homicides happening so often that one officer deemed the city a "killing field." That same year, the city laid off 66 officers, bringing the total number to about 120. In May 2011, Flint voters approved a tax renewal to prevent more layoffs. But they rejected a separate tax increase to fund the city jail. The jail has been shuttered since 2008. When when we looked at the FBI’s crime statistics, we found that Flint reported 32 murders in 2008 and 53 murders in 2010. (The Michigan State Police reported the same numbers.) Biden said 35 and 65 -- not exactly the same, but in the ballpark. After Biden’s remarks garnered attention, the city of Flint released a statement to several news organizations saying that the 2010 data reported to the FBI was incorrect, due to a clerical error, and that the number Biden used was accurate. Rapes in Flint For rapes, though, the numbers seemed seriously off. The FBI showed 103 rapes in 2008 and 92 rapes in 2010 -- a small decline. The numbers Biden cited were 91 rapes in 2008 and 229 in 2010 -- a dramatic increase. At first, we wondered if the differences were the result of the FBI’s more restrictive reporting requirements for what constitutes rape. The FBI definition -- "the carnal knowledge of a female, forcibly and against her will" -- is particularly restrictive, excluding male victims and other types of sexual assaults. (The New York Times recently published a detailed report on the problems of the rape definition.) However, it now seems clear that numbers the city of Flint gave Biden were wrong, that someone in the city used numbers for rape alone in 2008 but all categories of criminal sexual misconduct in 2010. (Our friends at Factcheck.org noted this discrepancy in several of their ongoing reports on the topic.) We checked numbers for rape with the Michigan State Police. They found that the Flint Police Department reported that rape, using the most restrictive definition, declined from 108 in 2008 to 92 in 2010. The state police also provided us numbers reported by the Flint Police Department for all sexual crimes, and those too declined, from 262 incidents in 2008 to 219 incidents in 2010. We should note that the city of Flint e-mailed us one statement in defense of the numbers Biden used. But the city’s spokesperson has not answered repeated phone calls and e-mails from PolitiFact to further explain discrepancies. Do more police officers mean less crime? So Biden is largely correct on murder in Flint going up, but wrong about the increase in rapes. Still, how would Obama’s jobs bill increase the number of police? It does not directly fund police positions. Rather, it sends additional money to the states, primarily for education. Biden is likely making the assumption that additional money in one area could prevent layoffs in another, as many states are required to balance their budget on an annual or biannual basis. Then there’s the question of whether fewer cops equals more crime. Generally speaking, most of the evidence we reviewed said that the number of police is one factor among several in preventing crime. James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University, said he agreed with Biden’s general point. The primary problem with reducing force strength is that there are fewer officers to staff special units that target a community’s particular problems, such as gangs or sexual assaults, he said. Large-scale reductions like Flint’s are particularly problematic, because rebuilding a force when the economy improves will take time, according to Fox. "It’s not like a light switch you can turn off and on," he said, because it takes so much time to hire and train new officers. "I’m always concerned when police force numbers are cut drastically. In the long run, it’s very problematic." We then turned to the peer-reviewed literature to see if social scientists have been able to isolate the effect of the size of the police force on crime. We found several recent studies concluded more police did reduce crime. But we also found at least one study that questioned the previous research, saying they did not control for other factors, such as public intolerance of crime. Our ruling Biden cited statistics saying that as Flint reduced its police force, the number of murders and rapes increased significantly. We find good evidence that the number of murders increased, but the number of rapes actually declined. Experts we spoke with and research we reviewed suggest that police force size has some bearing on crime but that it is only one of several factors. In ruling on Biden’s statement, we rate his statement Half True.	None	Joe Biden	None	None	None	2011-10-25T18:43:34	2011-10-12	['Flint,_Michigan']
pomt-02837	Florida "remains the top travel destination across the world."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/nov/21/rick-scott/rick-scott-declares-florida-top-travel-destination/	Florida Gov. Rick Scott is our salesman-in-chief when it comes to recruiting tourists. His office blasted a press release chock full of statistics about tourism in Florida that made us nod off like a lazy tourist on the beach -- until we came across this phrase: "As we move toward our third consecutive year of record tourism growth, it is clear why the Sunshine State remains the top travel destination across the world," stated the Nov. 15 press release. The "top travel destination across the world"? Is the home state of Mickey Mouse kicking the derriere of tourist hot spots like France? We went on a virtual trip to find out. Florida tourism stats We asked a spokesman for Scott for an explanation as to how he arrived at his claim. John Tupps said Scott was simply expressing a personal opinion that Florida is the best place to visit in the whole world, not making a quantitative statement. "The governor truly believes Florida is the ‘top travel destination’ in the world," Tupps said in an email. "It’s his personal view." We thought Scott’s wording went further than a personal opinion, though, so we decided put his statement on the Truth-O-Meter. We soon found that comparing tourism stats is tricky, because various states and countries use different methodologies to count visitors. Visit Florida, a quasi-state agency, counts out-of-state, overnight visitors. By that measurement, Florida had 91.5 million visitors in 2012. In California in 2012, there were 61 million out-of-state overnight trips. New York had about 62 million overnight out-of-state visitors in 2011, the most recent year available. So in state-to-state competition, Florida wins on the metric that Visit Florida uses. But the picture changes when we look around the world. According to the U.N.’s World Tourism Organization, in 2012, there were 83 million international visitors to France, compared with the United States in second place with 67 million. So on the metric of international visitors, France is clearly leading Florida. "We continue to say our goal is to beat France," said Kathy Torian, a spokeswoman for Visit Florida. Still, the comparison of Florida with France is tricky, because France is a country and Florida is a state. Florida’s 19 million population is about one-third the size of France’s population of about 66 million. Also, many Europeans travel to France just for a weekend, or visitors book a short stay in France, and then move on to other European destinations. So France may not be as dominant as its visitor counts make it appear. Comparing the number of visitors is not the only way to compare tourism rankings. We could also examine the amount of money spent by visitors. And while France is No. 1 in the number of international visitors, it tumbles behind the United States and Spain when you consider spending, the AP reported: "International visitors spent more than double in the U.S. than they did in France in 2012 – $126.2 billion, compared to $53.7 billion, according to the U.N.’s World Tourism Organization. That despite the fact that France welcomed 20 percent more tourists." The U.S. Travel Association reports that travel spending was $71.5 billion in Florida in 2011. That amount lags behind California, at $105 billion in 2011. Both those numbers top France's $53.7 billion in 2012. But to Scott's point, those spending numbers still don't put Florida in the No. 1 position. Our ruling While touting Florida’s tourism numbers, Scott said, "The Sunshine State remains the top travel destination across the world." There isn’t one simple way to declare "the" top travel destination in the world. But Scott’s claim would probably elicit a "mais non!" from Scott’s counterparts in France, who can boast to being the undisputed global leader of international tourists. And if you don't consider France a fair comparison, recent data on travel spending shows that California edges out Florida. Visit Florida is clamoring to achieve that No. 1 ranking, but we didn’t find proof that we are already there.

pomt-13456	Says "Patrick Murphy is the only candidate to have voted against every measure to fund Zika."	false	/florida/statements/2016/sep/14/marco-rubio/patrick-murphy-has-voted-against-every-zika-fundin/	While the Senate bickers over Zika funding, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio’s campaign says Democratic challenger U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy has been playing partisan politics over the issue in the House. The same day the Senate failed to approve emergency public health funding to deal with Zika for the third time in three months, Rubio spokeswoman Olivia Perez-Cubas said Murphy has been an obstructionist. "Patrick Murphy is the only candidate to have voted against every measure to fund Zika," she said on Sept. 7, 2016. (By "only," she meant the only general election Senate candidate, comparing Murphy to Rubio.) That doesn’t sound like the position a Florida congressman facing a Zika outbreak would take in an election year, so we checked the record. We should note Rubio has supported high-level funding for Zika efforts, even co-sponsoring a bill with Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson. Perez-Cubas was speaking for Rubio, so we are putting Rubio on the Truth-O-Meter. It turns out Murphy has opposed plenty of Republican-backed funding proposals, but "every" is putting it too strong. He still has voted for some measures. Funding malaise President Barack Obama first asked Congress for $1.89 billion in funding in February 2016 to deal with a potential outbreak of Zika. The virus has been linked to cases of infant microcephaly, or babies born with abnormally small heads. There is no treatment or vaccine for the disease, so focus has been on prevention. There are at least 771 cases of Zika in Florida, including several local transmissions in the Miami area. But that count may not always be the most accurate. Murphy has been involved with other Zika-related bills, including acting as a cosponsor for a Democrat-favored measure (HR 5044) that provided the full amount Obama requested. Those bills have not left committees in the House. A deeply partisan Congress, meanwhile, has fought all year over finding the money for mosquito control, vaccine development, diagnosing the disease, public education campaigns and more. There have been several measures introduced to deal with the disease, but the main focus this summer has been on some legislative wrangling over appropriations bills. House Republicans on May 18 passed a measure (HR 5243) that would have provided $622 million for Zika. With Obama threatening to veto the measure, Murphy voted no on that one with other Democrats. It was not taken up in the Senate. The next day, Murphy voted yes for a bill (HR 4974) that would have allowed the White House to repurpose leftover funding to deal with the 2014 Ebola outbreak and use it for Zika. Rubio’s campaign said this bill didn’t count, because there was no specified dollar amount, and didn’t guarantee the money would be used for Zika, only that it could. But that’s splitting hairs, because HR 4974 still would have provided at least one option to fund Zika-related programs. Now it’s time for a civics lesson, because what the House did next wasn’t covered on Schoolhouse Rock. The House then passed another bill (HR 2557) that was originally about funding for transportation and other agencies. Instead, the bill became a vehicle for Zika funding using language from HR 5243, the Republican measure. The House wanted $622 million for Zika, but cut that money from other programs in order to stay budget-neutral, a process known as recission. The House also added provisions restricting contraception services that Democrats opposed. The Senate wanted $1.1 billion in new funding. The bill went to conference in June to iron out differences. The House agreed to $1.1 billion in funding, as long as about $700 million was found through cutting other areas. Murphy voted against final passage of HR 2577, and against adopting the conference report instituting the changes. The Senate is currently battling over the bill. Senate Democrats have so far blocked a vote three times in three months, wanting a "clean" bill with no contraception provisions and the full $1.89 billion originally requested. That’s not the end of the line, however. On June 16, Murphy voted for HR 5293, a bill that would allow the administration to shift money in the Defense Department to help with Zika efforts through that agency. Again, there was no set dollar amount or guarantee that’s how the money would be used, but it was another option in the Zika toolbox. It passed the House but is stuck in the Senate. "Murphy did vote in favor of two efforts to transfer funds in support of Zika efforts and opposed the major effort in hopes of gaining more funding than the Republicans offered," said Steven Smith, a Washington University in St. Louis political science professor. Our ruling Rubio, through a spokeswoman, said, "Patrick Murphy is the only candidate to have voted against every measure to fund Zika." Murphy, like most congressional Democrats, has opposed Republican-led efforts to conditionally fund anti-Zika efforts at less than what Obama has requested. But he has offered other solutions and voted against his party for two bills that would have allowed unspecified amounts of money to be repurposed for Zika programs. So the campaign was wrong to say he voted against "every" measure. We rate Rubio’s statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d1f5fac7-dfa6-4ea1-ac20-dd29bc1b22ae	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2016-09-14T16:43:43	2016-09-07	['None']
pomt-06289	Says the state auditor found that 37 percent of the 428,000 students receiving free and reduced-price lunches are ineligible.	false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/nov/20/michael-doherty/nearly-160000-students-new-jerseys-school-lunch-pr/	The school board president and two other individuals connected to the Elizabeth school district have been accused of illegally signing up their children for the federal school lunch program, but according to state Sen. Michael Doherty, that’s just the "tip of the iceberg." Standing before members of the East Jersey Tea Party, Doherty suggested the state auditor had determined that nearly 160,000 students across the state were receiving free or reduced-price meals when they shouldn’t be. "We have 428,000 kids in the state of New Jersey signed up for free or reduced-price lunch. Our state auditor checked the records, and you know what he found?" Doherty (R-Warren) said during the Nov. 3 appearance. "He found, out of 428,000, when he checked the records, 37 percent of the students that were signed up were actually ineligible." After checking the auditor’s report, PolitiFact New Jersey found that Doherty's math was a bit overwrought. Here's why. Each year, according to state and federal officials, schools are required by the federal government to audit three percent of the total number of the school lunch applications they receive. They are instructed to focus on the ones that are within $100 of the household income that qualifies children for a free or reduced-cost lunch. The logic, state and federal officials say, is that since there are 428,000 kids in the program across New Jersey, you can't check them all. So concentrate on the ones that seem close to the income limit. In 2010 the state auditor looked at the three percent analyzed by each school and found that 37 percent did not actually qualify for the program, which translated to 2,723 erroneous applications. There was never an attempt to analyze the entire 428,000 so there is no way to know what the real number of improper applications actually is. "I stand by the accuracy of my statement," Doherty told us. But the state auditor, Stephen Eells did consider what the overall number of erroneous applications might be. In his report, Eells projected that 58,000 of the 428,000 students may be ineligible, if the results of the analysis conducted by his office are reflective of all approved applications. Our ruling Doherty claimed the state auditor found that 37 percent of 428,000 students in the school lunch program were ineligible, but the 37 percent does not apply to the 428,000. The 37 percent applies to a limited number of questionable applications subject to verification, which translates to about 2,723 ineligible applications. The students behind those applications were not among the 428,000 students cited by Doherty. We rate his statement False. The abuses in the school lunch program are bad enough as they are without any fuzzy math, senator. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-01184	"We've had the lowest health care inflation in history because of Obamacare."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/dec/05/gwen-moore/gwen-moore-says-obamacare-created-lowest-ever-infl/	A week after the mid-term elections, in which the GOP gained considerable ground in Congress, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore was asked if Americans had rejected President Barack Obama’s policies. The Milwaukee Democrat responded, in part, by saying Republicans had take many steps to "discredit" Obama, including voting more than 50 times to repeal his Affordable Care Act. "But the reality," Moore stated Nov. 11, 2014 on Wisconsin Public Radio, "is that Obamacare has lowered health care costs by $36 billion just this year. We've had the lowest health care inflation in history because of Obamacare." The bolder claim about Obamacare -- that health care inflation in the United States is the lowest ever because of the law -- is one we want to check. Inflation vs. spending Health care inflation and health care spending are sometimes used interchangeably, but they are different. Inflation refers to health care prices from one year to the next, while spending is, well, how much is spent on health care. It turns out that growth in both health care inflation and expenditures are at historic lows, at least dating back to when the federal government began tracking them in 1960. Moore’s office cited data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis that shows health care inflation, as of the end of 2013, at about 1 percent per year -- the lowest since the early 1960s. Some economists prefer to consider actual health care expenditures, since that goes to how much health care is being used and how much is being paid for it. The latest estimates from the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services put health care spending at $2.8 trillion, or $8,915 per person, in 2012. That marked the fourth straight year, dating back to 2009, that the annual increase was less than 4 percent. Again, those are historic lows dating back to 1960. (A few weeks after Moore made her claim, the 2013 figure was released, showing health expenditures rose 3.6 percent, the lowest annual increase since 1960.) So, Moore is on the right track in terms of the figures. But the thrust of her claim is that the inflation slowdown is due to Obamacare. Moore spokesman Eric Harris argued that Moore didn’t claim Obamacare is the sole cause of the slowdown in health care prices, although she believes it is an important one. But Moore made her statement while defending the law and clearly gave it singular credit for the smaller increases in medical inflation. Obamacare’s role There is not widespread agreement that the Affordable Care Act is the key factor in limiting medical inflation. The inflation rates are lowest since the law took effect in March 2010, though they were trending downward several years earlier and the law has been rolled out only in stages. Even the president’s Council of Economic Advisers, in a November 2013 report, said "the causes of the slowdown are not yet fully understood" -- although it gave some credit to Obamacare, including the law’s reduction in Medicare payments to health care providers. And the council’s chairman wrote in the Wall Street Journal that "many factors, including the recession and one-time developments like blockbuster drugs coming off patent, have contributed to the slowdown," but that Obamacare "has made a meaningful contribution." We sought out some economists, as well. Harvard University’s David Cutler, who served as the senior health care adviser to Obama’s 2008 campaign, told us "nobody has the complete answer" for the smaller increases in health care inflation but that Obamacare is "important." Others downplayed the role of the health care reform law. Charles Roehrig, director of the Center for Sustainable Health Spending at the nonprofit Altarum Institute, noted that Obamacare’s main aim is to expand health insurance coverage, not reduce prices. It is a factor in healthcare inflation, but the smaller increases in health prices are "mainly explained by slower overall price inflation," he said. And like other economists, Gail Wilensky, who ran Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, told us much of the slowing in medical-price inflation is simply due to the "unusually slow recovery from the recession." The Affordable Act, she said, has had perhaps a "small effect." Finally, the Washington Post Fact Checker arrived at a similar conclusion in rating a November 2014 claim by Obama that health care inflation "has gone down every single year" since the Affordable Care Act passed. The president, though he wasn’t as bold as Moore, was given "three pinocchios" for a statement that has "significant factual error and/or obvious contradictions." "There are certainly some cost-controls contained in the law, but it remains unclear whether those measures have really had that much impact, especially because the Great Recession clearly had affected health-care inflation even before the law was implemented," The Fact Checker wrote. "Just as growth in health-care costs have slowed because the 2009 economic crisis, so has economic growth and general price inflation overall." Our rating Moore said: "We've had the lowest health care inflation in history because of Obamacare." There’s an element of truth in her claim, given that the Affordable Care Act is given some credit for the smallest increases in health care inflation on record. But Moore’s claim gave virtually all the credit to Obamacare, when there isn’t evidence it played that large of a role. We rate Moore’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-07491	President Obama has spent over $2 million in legal fees defending lawsuits about his birth certificate.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/12/donald-trump/donald-trump-claims-obama-has-spent-2-million-lega/	Among those who challenge President Barack Obama's citizenship, one claim is often raised: Why would Obama spend millions of dollars defending against the lawsuits instead of simply producing his original birth certificate? That argument took on renewed life recently when it was cited by potential GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. And the argument is almost always attached to a specific figure: $2 million. In an interview on NBC's Today show, for example, Trump said Obama "spent $2 million in legal fees trying to get away from this issue." He repeated the figure in a CNN interview on April 10, 2011. "I just say very simply why doesn't he show his birth certificate?" Trump asked. "Why has he spent over $2 million in legal fees to keep this quiet and to keep this silent?" (For some background on the underpinnings of the dispute over Obama birth certificate, start here). In a Fox News appearance on April 10, 2011, Palin echoed the figure while praising Trump's efforts. Trump is "paying for researchers to find out why President Obama would have to spend $2 million to not show his birth certificate," Palin said. "So more power to him." It's certainly true that the Obama campaign has spent some amount of money opposing an array of lawsuits brought by people who claim that Obama has failed to produce a legitimate birth certificate and is therefore ineligible to serve as president. But has the president spent $2 million? We contacted Trump's office to find out where he got the number, but we did not receive a response. Others who have used the number have cited a story from WorldNetDaily, a conservative news website that has served as a venue for news and commentary about the birth certificate controversy. In an Oct. 27, 2009, article, WND reported that, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission, the Obama campaign had paid approximately $1.7 million to the campaign's law firm, Perkins Coie, since Obama was elected. So that's where we started our research. We did our own tally of payments made to Perkins Coie, all of which were reported, as required by law, in quarterly disbursement reports filed to the FEC by his campaign organization, Obama for America. We found that in the last quarter of 2008 -- which is roughly the period after Obama was elected in early November -- and the first three quarters of 2009, which is when WND wrote its story, Obama for America did, in fact, pay Perkins Coie $1.7 million. If you add in the payments made in subsequent months, the fees paid to Perkins Coie between October 2008 and December 2010 rises to $2.6 million. But what does that $2.6 million number mean? Not what Trump and others have assumed. Specifically, the payments by Obama for America to Perkins Coie covered all sorts of legal expenses -- not just expenses related to birth certificate issues. The FEC forms do not specify what each payment specifically went for, since that degree of detail is not required by law. We also couldn't get additional details from Perkins Coie or the Democratic National Committee about how the legal fees were spent. However, DNC National Press Secretary Hari Sevugan told the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call in a March 31, 2011, story that "the campaign has incurred ordinary legal expenses related to the wind-down of its operations and other legal services, which all campaigns incur, and which are proportional to the unprecedented size of this campaign." (The Obama campaign raised upwards of $750 million -- a record.) For the sake of comparison, the Roll Call story noted that the campaign for Obama's 2008 Republican opponent John McCain -- which was a smaller operation -- had spent more than $1.3 million on lawyers since the election. In the interview with Roll Call, Sevugan confirmed that some of the legal fees were needed to defend the campaign against what he called "unmeritorious" lawsuits, including one that challenged Obama’s citizenship. And WND reported that Perkins Coie attorney Robert Bauer wrote at least one letter to challenge a plaintiff, retired military officer Gregory S. Hollister, who had filed a suit raising questions about the legitimacy of Obama's right to hold the office of president. WND reported that Bauer -- who later left Perkins Coie to serve as White House counsel -- wrote to Hollister's attorney that "the suit is frivolous and should not be pursued. Should you decline to withdraw this frivolous appeal, please be informed that we intend to pursue sanctions, including costs, expenses and attorneys' fees...." Still, there are clearly lots of other expenses incurred by the Obama campaign's legal team that have nothing to do with the citizenship question. For instance, the Republican National Committee filed a complaint with the FEC claiming that the Obama campaign had accepted donations from foreign nationals, among other alleged campaign finance infractions. All told, Roll Call reported that "the FEC has written 26 letters — totaling more than 1,500 pages — to the Obama campaign questioning its reports and outlining a flurry of compliance concerns." After we looked through court records and spoke to experts in the field, we found insufficient evidence to support the claim that Obama for America spent $2 million solely on birth-certificate-related work. Four campaign-finance experts we interviewed all agreed that after the campaign was over, a law firm in Perkins Coie’s situation would have a full plate of legal work to do that had nothing to do with birth certificate questions. Two of the experts who took this position have represented Republicans -- Trevor Potter, a campaign finance lawyer who worked for the 2000 and 2008 presidential campaigns of John McCain and the 1988 campaign of George H.W. Bush, and Robert Kelner, who has represented the Republican National Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee. A third attorney who agreed, Allison R. Hayward, is the vice president of policy for the Center for Competitive Politics, which filed an amicus brief opposing the Obama administration’s position in the landmark Citizens United Supreme Court case, which ended a broad swath of campaign finance restrictions. "FEC audits and/or enforcement matters can take several years -- most are still open from the 2008 election," said Potter, general counsel to the Campaign Legal Center. "Various criminal investigations of donors may require campaign responses. Lawsuits against the campaign, campaign staff, and/or the candidate take time to defend. Vendor disputes may exist and require settlement." "Law firms representing presidential campaigns typically are very busy in the one to two years following the campaign," said Brett Kappel, a lawyer with the firm Arent Fox LLP who specializes in campaign finance law. "First, there are all the legal issues involved in closing down the campaign –- resolving disputes with vendors, preparation for the FEC audit and so on. Second, the one to two years after the campaign is over are typically when all the FEC complaints that were filed against the campaign are resolved, and that’s certainly been the case with the 2008 Obama campaign." We should note that, since Obama was elected, a number of federal cases related to the birth certificate issue -- including several filed by or with the assistance of California attorney Orly Taitz, a leader among Obama birth certificate questioners -- have been handled by federal attorneys, including those with the U.S. Department of Justice. Several of these cases were dismissed almost immediately. Others were active for up to a year but were ultimately dismissed and then, in some cases, appealed. The case in which Bauer wrote the letter to the plaintiff was dismissed twice by the Supreme Court. We interpret the quotations by Trump and Palin to mean payments made by Obama in a personal capacity, not in cases where he's represented in an official capacity by government lawyers. For one thing, both Trump and Palin used the term "legal fees," which would be irrelevant in a case defended by government lawyers. Federal attorneys are paid a salary by the taxpayers, and they do not charge their "client" -- in this case, the president -- fees for representation. If these attorneys weren't working on birth certificate cases, they'd be working on some other case for the same salary. So that leaves the funds paid to Perkins Coie. Trump's and Palin's claims assume that the vast majority of the money paid to Perkins Coie since the election was used to defend against lawsuits challenging Obama's citizenship. We agree that some amount of money was spent in legal fees related to those lawsuits -- the letter from Bauer to the plaintiff is an example of that. But, while we don't know exactly how much the Obama camp spent on their private lawyers, there were many, many non-birth-certificate duties that a law firm typically handles in the wake of a presidential campaign, which suggests that any birth certificate work was a small percentage of the overall fees paid to Perkins Coie. When fact-checking, we think the onus is on the person making the claim to back up his statement. And the only backing we've seen in this case is that the Obama campaign's legal team spent more than $2 million on legal fees since the election ended. It's clear to us that the WND story has been twisted to wrongly assume that every dollar the Obama campaign spent on legal fees went to fight the release of Obama's birth certificate. The evidence shows that's simply not true. It's a huge, unsubstantiated leap to assume that all, or most, of that was related to lawsuits about Obama's citizenship. We rule Trump's claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/74d49c90-3e18-4dfd-9bd9-2fbde85d90cd	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2011-04-12T16:10:25	2011-04-07	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-12228	Says Ted Kennedy met "with the KGB in order to beat Ronald Reagan in 1984."	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/jul/18/greg-gutfeld/fox-news-host-cites-ted-kennedy-kgb-meeting-never-/	Supporters of President Donald Trump have defended Donald Trump Jr. and his readiness to receive Russian materials on Hillary Clinton by finding examples when Democrats tried to do something similar. Fox News host Greg Gutfeld brought up the case of Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass. "Nothing will ever come close to Ted Kennedy meeting with the KGB in order to beat Ronald Reagan in 1984," Gutfeld said on his show July 15. "It was a quid pro quo. You help the Dems. We help the USSR. If it worked, we would still have the USSR." As Gutfeld spoke, a graphic appeared on the screen of a 2009 Forbes magazine article, "Ted Kennedy’s Soviet Gambit." This isn’t the first time we’ve seen a claim like this, and it’s not the first time this Kennedy-KGB story tracked back to that Forbes story. So is it true? Hardly. There’s not much to back up the tale under any circumstances, but Gutfeld went overboard even relative to the Forbes article. He said Kennedy met with the KGB, something the Forbes piece doesn’t even mention. The Forbes article describes a 1983 memo from Viktor Chebrikov, then head of the Soviet spy agency, to Yuri Andropov, the then-general secretary of the Communist Party. Chebrikov wrote that Kennedy’s trusted friend John Tunney, a former senator from California, had passed along Kennedy’s interest in meeting with Andropov. So even if you take the memo from KGB agent as gospel, there was no actual meeting between Kennedy and the KGB. But what about the rest of the details and the memo? Was Kennedy looking to undermine Reagan? That’s murkier than you might expect. Step back to 1983 In early 1983, Reagan’s plan to place medium-range nuclear missiles in Western Europe generated great concern among voters in the West and also within the leadership of the USSR. The KGB memo detailed a proposal, ostensibly from Kennedy via Tunney, to de-escalate tensions. Those steps included Andropov inviting Kennedy and Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., for a meeting in Moscow. The purpose "would be to arm Soviet officials with explanations regarding problems of nuclear disarmament so they may be better prepared and more convincing during appearances in the USA." In addition, Kennedy’s middleman suggested that Andropov come to the United States where he could do interviews on the big three broadcast networks and speak to the "peaceful intentions of the USSR." According to the memo, Kennedy’s goal was to "root out the threat of nuclear war, and to improve Soviet-American relations, so that they define the safety of the world." The memo does mention Kennedy’s interest in the presidency, but the idea was for Kennedy to run in 1988. (Kennedy never ran and supported then-Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.) The memo said, "Because he (Kennedy) formally refused to partake in the election campaign of 1984, his speeches would be taken without prejudice as they are not tied to any campaign promises. Tunney remarked that the senator wants to run for president in 1988." Having served two terms, Reagan would not be on the ballot in 1988. To believe or not believe the memo The memo gained attention when it was the basis of a news report published in the London Times in 1992, after the Soviet Union dissolved. When the report came out, Tunney told the London Times that it was "bull----." We reached Tunney in 2015, and he emphatically repeated that. "The idea that I would be handling contacts with Andropov is preposterous," Tunney said. "This memo is completely false." At the time, Tunney was a private businessman, but his friendship with Kennedy dated back to law school. He said that while he had made many trips to Moscow over the years and knew people in the KGB, the only political topic Kennedy ever asked him to broach with the Soviets was a deal to release dozens of dissidents. In exchange, Kennedy would make a speech at a university in one of the USSR’s republics in Central Asia. That took place several years earlier. Tunney said that some time after the memo emerged, Kennedy asked him if he knew anything about it, and Tunney said, "this is crazy." In 1992, a Boston Herald reporter reached Kennedy spokesman Paul Donovan. Donovan said Kennedy’s office had made other efforts to meet with Andropov, but nothing ever came of it. According to the Herald, Donovan said, "The rest of the memo is KGB fiction." Denials from anyone tied to Kennedy might be expected, but Kennedy does have a sort of character reference in the arena of foreign relations from a Reagan insider, the administration’s disarmament negotiator Max Kampelman. In his memoirs Entering New Worlds, Kampelman wrote that the Soviets liked working with Kennedy as a back-door conduit of information, and Kampelman welcomed the arrangement. "I learned that the senator never acted or received information without informing the appropriate United States agency or official," Kampelman wrote. In 1985, Reagan himself approved using Kennedy this way, and a working relationship grew between Kampelman and Kennedy. While it is possible that the administration never caught wind of any contacts Tunney had with the KGB, it is worth noting that when the archivists at the Reagan Library searched the White House files on Kennedy, no episode involving the USSR in 1983 popped up. Smoke, but no fire? In the Reagan years, Kenneth Adelman served as deputy U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. and then director of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. In 2015, we asked Adelman what he made of the KGB memo, and he dismissed it. He had no idea if an overture might have been made, but even it had, Adelman said it didn’t matter. "We knew senators were doing this sort of thing all the time, and we ignored it," Adelman said. "We didn’t think it was important, and it wasn’t. The administration didn’t care about it." Stephen Cohen, a political scientist at Princeton University and New York University, suggested that KGB memos shouldn’t be taken at face value. "As someone who has worked for years in once closed Soviet-era archives, I can tell you that many false documents can be found there," Cohen told PunditFact in 2015. "As the saying goes, rubbish in, rubbish out." Paul Kengor, a political scientist at Grove City College who included the memo in his book about Reagan, The Crudasder, takes the memo seriously. "The memo is absolutely accurate," Kengor said. "No question." It is worth noting that the memo does not say how Tunney conveyed Kennedy's message beyond "through confidential contacts." In other words, the memo's author was relying on someone else and not speaking from his own experience, which introduces another level of uncertainty. Our ruling Gutfeld said that Kennedy met with the KGB in order to defeat Ronald Reagan in 1984. There is certainly evidence that Kennedy attempted to meet with Soviet officials, but it was with the approval of the Reagan White House. The validity of a specific KGB memo saying Kennedy wanted to de-escalate tensions with Moscow over a U.S. plan to install nuclear missiles in Western Europe is widely questioned. But more to the point, Gutfeld reached one conclusion that doesn’t add up. There is no evidence of Kennedy "meeting with the KGB." The evidence Gutfeld used on screen doesn’t support that contention.

pomt-06438	"We cut property taxes by one-third in the state of Texas while I’ve been governor."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/21/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-they-cut-property-taxes-one-third-/	On the campaign trail in New Hampshire earlier this month, Texas Gov. Rick Perry repeated what has become a common battle cry in his campaign for the Republican nomination for president. "We cut property taxes by one-third in the state of Texas while I've been governor," he told a crowd Oct. 1, 2011 at a "We the People" forum in Hampton, New Hampshire. Perry has repeated the claim several times during his presidential run, and he also used it during his 2010 re-election campaign in Texas. PolitiFact Texas checked it at the time, coming up with a ruling of Barely True, now known as Mostly False. But has anything changed in the years since? We decided to check it out. As we discovered in early 2010, Perry is referring to House Bill 1, a tax law approved by the Texas Legislature in 2006. In 2005, five years into his tenure as governor, Perry created the bi-partisan Texas Tax Reform Commission, which developed the proposal. And the following year, he signed into law the overhaul, intended to reduce property taxes paid to local school districts. The overhaul did decrease a portion of the state’s school tax rate. It effectively lowered the maintenance and operation segment of the school tax, which makes up most of the school taxes, from $1.50 to $1.00 per $100 of assessed property value. That number met Perry’s claim of a one-third cut. But it didn’t translate to 33 percent lower bills for taxpayers, which is what we think most voters would infer from the claim. In 2007, the first year the tax changes were fully implemented, the total amount of tax dollars paid to local schools, fell about 6.4 percent from levels in 2005, before the tax overhaul, according to the state Comptroller’s office. Yet, when including county, city and school taxes, among others, the total amount of taxes paid increased by about 5 percent from 2005 to 2007, reaching $35.1 billion. Both the school tax levy and total property taxes continued to rise in 2008 and 2009. The amount of total tax dollars paid reached $40 billion in 2009. But the school and total taxes took a nose dive last year. In 2010, the most recent data available, school taxes dropped about 1 percent to $21.6 billion, but that number is 6.8 percent higher than 2005, before the tax overhaul was implemented. Total property tax dollars dropped back to $33.7 billion in 2010, roughly even to the $33.5 billion paid in 2005. Adjusting for inflation, however, the total amount of taxes collected fell by 9 percent, which is a little closer to Perry’s statement. Still, these numbers don’t show the picture of tax relief that Perry paints on the campaign trail. Nor do they tell the full story either, according to Texas policy analysts. Much of the tax increase can be attributed to factors including population growth and rising property values, analysts said. And voters and local school districts have contributed, as well, electing to restore higher local tax rates to better fund schools, according to Dick Lavine, a senior analyst with the Center for Public Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank in Austin, Texas. The 2006 overhaul legislation left room for local school boards for a one-time restoration of up to 4 cents to the operations and maintenance tax without an election. Voters could return up to 17 cents to the tax rate, Lavine said. "The vast majority (added to the rate) almost immediately," he said. "About a quarter are now at $1.17. They’re back in the same situation they were before." From the beginning, these factors have clouded some of the impact the overhaul has had on the state’s taxpayers, other analysts suggest. The tax reform may not have lowered homeowners’ property tax bills, but, in 2007, it did shave $7 billion off what Texans would have paid without the rate cut, according to the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, an Austin-based business group. "That means the average Texan’s total property tax bill in 2007 was 20 percent lower than what it likely would have been had there been no tax relief initiative," the association wrote in its 2008 report "Property Tax Relief: The $7 Billion Reality." The group said that number was a "rough" estimate. "I don't think there's any question, it represented a net tax decrease for the state of Texas." echoed Joshua Trevino, a spokesman for the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a right-leaning free market group. "I don’t think that’s in question." Our ruling Perry was correct if you only look at school tax rate, but his comment referred to all property taxes. If you look at total property tax revenue, Texans paid about the same amount in 2010 as they did in 2005. If you adjust for inflation, he's closer (it's about 9 percent less) but it's still far short of one-third. We find his claim Mostly False.

pomt-08255	Georgia's high school graduation rate topped 80 percent in 2010.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2010/nov/12/sonny-perdue/perdue-touts-states-rising-graduation-rates/	With the announcement that Georgia's high school graduation rate topped 80 percent, Gov. Sonny Perdue took a celebratory tour of the state's standout schools. Perdue thanked students and staff at schools across North Georgia and along the South Georgia coast for their hard work. He promised he'd reach the 80 percent mark by 2010. With their help, he kept his word. Or did he? Other measures say Georgia's rate is lower by as much as 15 points. And while the state Department of Education reports it's making great strides, one group said last year that Georgia's graduation rate is so low Georgia's children are in "crisis." The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has uncovered multiple problems with how the rate is reported. Is Georgia's graduation rate really 80 percent? We went to the Georgia Department of Education to sort the issue out. Raising the rate to 80 percent by 2010 has been one of Perdue's major education initiatives. In 2005, he signed on to a national effort by the National Governors Association to standardize how states determine the graduation rate and improve the figure's accuracy. Under the new method, which the state will report for the first time this school year,school officials expect the rate to drop. Perdue also created the position of "graduation coach," and he announced at a 2008 national education convention that it helped reduce dropouts by 10 percent in one year. The coaches identify high school and middle school students at risk of dropping out, find them mentors, organize tutoring programs, and help them sign up to retake classes they failed. Now, back to the graduation rate. There are lots of ways to calculate it. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses. They can vary greatly. For instance, some count only students who graduate on time. Others count graduates who take longer. Georgia uses what's commonly called the "leaver rate," a method used by 32 other states. The Education Department puts the exact graduation rate at 80.8 percent. It includes students who take more than four years to graduate. The leaver rate is not the actual percentage of students who graduate. Until recently, the state Education Department lacked a record keeping system that could track that. Instead, it's an estimate. To calculate it, you take the number of students who receive regular graduation diplomas and divide it by the following: the number of regular diploma recipients, plus the number of students who receive special education diplomas and certificates of attendance, plus the number of dropouts from grades 9-12. State officials acknowledge the measure is imperfect. The new method will be more accurate. Still, it's a fair accountability measure, they said. Since the state has used the same method to calculate graduation rates since Perdue took office in 2003, a year-to-year comparison is valid. Those numbers show the graduation rate surged from about 63 percent to 80 percent, said Perdue spokesman Bert Brantley. Another advantage of Georgia's leaver rate is it's the most current data around. Graduation rates calculated with other measures have yet to be updated with numbers from two or three years ago. That means they don't measure the impact of the graduation coach program, Brantley said. But AJC PolitiFact Georgia thinks there are other shortcomings with the leaver rate that should be acknowledged, and which cast Georgia's apparent success in a different light. The most perplexing is that the state's calculation misses thousands of students. In 2008, the state Department of Education could not account for nearly 20,000 students they marked as transfers, although it's not clear they went. The state's 2010 graduation numbers raise similar questions. Georgia's Class of 2010 entered high school in 2006 at about 146,000 strong, according to the state's figures. But when the state calculated its 2010 graduation rate, it pegged the combined number of Georgia students who graduated plus those who didn't make it at about 113,300. That means this year's graduation calculation does not include about 33,000 of the Class of 2010's original members. A portion likely went to private school or are being home schooled, but given the department's past problems, it's far from clear that that's where all of them went. Another problem is that while Georgia's leaver rate soared during Perdue's term, other widely used measures did not. Consider the public high school averaged freshman graduation rate, which is collected and published by the National Center for Education Statistics, the U.S. Department of Education's main data clearinghouse, and graduation calculations from Editorial Projects in Education, a nonprofit education research center. The averaged freshman graduation rate uses the number of on-time graduates with regular diplomas and an estimate of the freshman class size four years earlier to come up with its rate. The Editorial Projects in Education rate multiplies together how many students were promoted on time each year to get its rate. According to Editorial Projects in Education, Georgia's graduation rate grew between 2002-2003 and 2006-2007, the most recent school year available, by about 1.4 points to 57.8 percent. During that same time period, the U.S. Department of Education's averaged freshman graduation rate for Georgia grew by 3.3 points to 64.1 percent. In those same years, Georgia reported its graduation rate grew by 9 points to 72.3 percent. These discrepancies may occur because the rates count different things, said state Department of Education spokesman Matt Cardoza. Georgia's leaver rate includes five-year graduates, but the other two measures count only those who finish on schedule. Georgia officials think it's important to count students who take extra time, because it shows schools are committed to students who need more help. "If we keep them [high school students] five years instead of four, and that helps them graduate, we're all for it," Cardoza said. Still, it's difficult to tell which measure is more accurate, said John Robert Warren, a University of Minnesota sociologist. He was part of a major effort by the National Academy of Education that studied how to improve the reliability of graduation rates. "They're all sort of in the ballpark of not being that good," Warren said of the measures. In the case of leaver rates, experts agree they often inflate graduation figures. That's because the formula depends so heavily on a state's dropout rate. Experts agree dropouts are easy to undercount. A typical dropout doesn't bother to tell his school he no longer intends to show up, and schools often don't have the resources or incentive to track down missing students. Another problem is shared by all measures. They're only as accurate as the data used to calculate them. In Georgia, there's evidence that at least some of this data has serious problems. In June 2009, an Atlanta Journal-Constitution investigation found the state couldn't locate nearly 20,000 students who local districts said transferred to other Georgia schools during the 2008 school year, but who never re-enrolled. In April, the U.S. Department of Education rebuked the state Department of Education and Clayton County and determined the county's 2006-2007 dropout rates were undercounted. A state Education Department spokesman said they enhanced their procedures, but did not correct older data. In August, another Atlanta Journal-Constitution investigation found that thousands of Atlanta Public Schools students vanished from its rolls during the past eight years, and this may be the primary reason behind the system's rising graduation rates. Many students were marked as transfers, even though there was no evidence they re-enrolled elsewhere. So what does all of this information say about Georgia's graduation rate? If one thing is clear, it's this: No one knows the state's true graduation rate. Although the state Education Department said it has improved its reporting methods, the way the agency calculates the rate and the data's quality still have enough unresolved problems that it's hard to say whether the state actually met Perdue's goal. It's also not clear how much the state graduation rate has improved. Georgia said its rate has soared during Perdue's term, but one measure said it's flat and another said it rose by a few percentage points. Those other rates don't measure the exact same thing. They also use old data, so it's possible that fresh calculations will show a spike in rates. But at this point, it's doubtful they'll register a 17-point change as Georgia's leaver rate did. This means that while the high 2009-2010 graduation rate may be an encouraging sign, it's not quite a cause for celebration. Perdue's statement is accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. By PolitiFact's standards, it rates a Half True.

pomt-15350	"There’s now been three independent investigations (into the bridge scandal) all of which have said" that Christie did not have prior knowledge of or involvement in the lane closures.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/09/chris-christie/chris-christie-bridgegate-investigations-back-my-s/	Aside from the national media, no one cares about Bridgegate, says New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. On MSNBC’s Morning Joe July 6, host Joe Scarborough said he generally hasn’t noticed New Hampshire voters asking the Republican presidential candidate about the September 2013 bridge-closing scandal. "Nobody cares," Christie responded. "They don't care because they know that there’s now been three independent investigations all of which have said exactly the same thing I said the day after it happened. And so, at some point people just say well, you know, after three investigations -- two of them run by folks who were Democrats, Democratic legislature and Democratically appointed U.S. attorney -- you know, after a while people just say, ‘Okay, I guess he's telling the truth.’ " Multiple New Jersey officials close to Christie have been accused of devising a scheme to close parts of the George Washington bridge, under the guise of conducting a traffic study, causing a week of massive traffic jams in September 2013. The maneuver is widely believed to have been political retribution against officials in Fort Lee, N.J., which was most impacted by the lane closures. Since the week of the closures, Christie has consistently denied that he knew anything about the lane closures until after the fact. In the first few weeks after the lane closures -- before many details came to light -- Christie said the extensive press coverage was overblown. "I had nothing to do with this: No knowledge. No authorization. No planning," he said in a radio interview in February 2014, adding that he learned about the closures from media reports afterward. Have three investigations agreed with him? Christie’s campaign did not respond to our requests for comment. But we have a good idea who conducted the three investigations: A Manhattan law firm, the New Jersey legislature and the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey. One of these investigations has shut the door -- saying Christie had no involvement -- but the other two left the question open-ended. Gibson Dunn and Crutcher Christie’s administration commissioned law firm Gibson Dunn and Crutcher to conduct an internal probe in January 2014, soon after it came out that members of Christie’s senior staff knew about or were involved in the lane closures. The results of that investigation support the contention that Christie himself had nothing to do with the scandal. "Our investigation found that Gov. Christie did not know of the lane realignment beforehand and had no involvement in the decision to realign the lanes," the report said. "He does not recall becoming aware of the lane realignment during the period the lanes were closed, but would not have considered a traffic issue memorable in any event." A Port Authority official -- who later pleaded guilty to charges stemming from the scandal -- said he told Christie about the closures while they were happening, when the two were together at a Sept. 11 memorial event. Christie said he didn’t remember the conversation. "Gov. Christie’s account of these events rings true," the report continued, noting that document reviews and witness interviews fully corroborated Christie’s story. According to the Wall Street Journal, Gibson Dunn attorney Randy Mastro said, "Our findings today are a vindication of Gov. Christie." New Jersey Legislature A December 2014 report out of the New Jersey Legislative Select Committee on Investigation came to a much less definitive conclusion on Christie’s involvement. The investigation found "no conclusive evidence" as to whether Christie knew about the lane closures in advance or while they were happening. The report said a lack of information from some key witnesses "leaves open the question of when the governor first learned of the closures and what he was told." The inquiry found no smoking gun implicating Christie, but the committee concluded that it is "not in a position currently to conclude what Gov. Christie himself knew about the lane closures or when and how his knowledge of these events developed." U.S. Attorney investigation A U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey investigation, made public in May 2015, did not find evidence that Christie was criminally involved in planning or concealing the bridge scandal. The investigation resulted in charges of conspiracy and other crimes against three state officials: Bridget Anne Kelly, Christie’s former chief of staff; Bill Baroni, a Christie-appointed executive at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey; and David Wildstein, another Port Authority executive and one of Christie’s political allies. Wildstein pleaded guilty. But the U.S. Attorney’s Office didn’t indict Christie. "Today’s charges make clear that what I’ve said from day one is true, I had no knowledge or involvement in the planning or execution of this act," Christie said following the indictments against his former staffers, according to the Wall Street Journal. Some critics have suggested that because still more evidence could come forward, Christie is not yet fully in the clear. It’s possible that now under the pressure of criminal charges, Kelly and Baroni could reveal information that implicates Christie, wrote Tim Moran, editorial page editor of New Jersey’s Star-Ledger newspaper. At the time, U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said, "We’re always going to be receptive to new evidence, what I will say is this though: Based on the evidence currently available to us, we’re not going to charge anyone else in this scheme." Fishman also declined to comment on whether others (including Christie) will continue to be investigated for involvement. Our ruling Christie said, "There’s now been three independent investigations (into the bridge scandal) all of which have said" that Christie did not have prior knowledge of or involvement in the lane closures. Christie has said since day one that he had no knowledge of the scandal before or during the closures themselves. Three investigations -- a law firm commissioned by Christie, the state legislature and the U.S. attorney’s office -- found no evidence to suggest otherwise. However, only the law firm investigation expressly stated that Christie had no knowledge of the lane closures. In contrast, the legislature’s investigation suggested that it’s still a possibility if more evidence emerges, and the U.S. attorney didn’t say the case is definitively closed. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important context, so we rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2d659490-7a00-4208-9747-2a9f204e6f8e	None	Chris Christie	None	None	None	2015-07-09T11:31:52	2015-07-06	['None']
pomt-11803	"80 percent of the (individual mandate) tax falls on those who make $50,000 a year or less."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/17/john-thune/sen-thune-individual-mandate-fine-falls-mainly-peo/	Senate Republicans’ surprise move to repeal the requirement to have health insurance into their tax reform bill revealed numbers that few people had noted before. (The mandate says that everyone must have coverage or face a fine.) "80 percent of the tax falls on those who make $50,000 a year or less," Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., told Fox News Nov. 15. "We’re taking a failed policy that punishes people with taxes -- low-income people. (We’re) taking that tax away, giving them tax relief there, and then ploughing that back into tax relief for middle-income families." This was no throw-away line. Thune is the third-ranking Republican in the party’s Senate leadership, and his colleagues delivered similar versions of the talking point throughout the day. In 2016, the fine for not having insurance stood at $695 for adults. The formula has a few wrinkles that brought the maximum penalty to $2,085 for a family, or 2.5 percent of income, whichever was larger. Going forward, it rises with inflation (unless of course, Congress repeals it). Not everyone without insurance has to pay the fine. The list of exemptions is long. It includes a family with income under $20,800; people who have suffered domestic violence in the household; anyone who has suffered the death of a close family member; someone who has received a utility shut-off notice, and more. Thune’s office said he got his information from 2015 data from the Internal Revenue Service. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com In one key sense, Thune is correct. Out of all the tax returns sent to the IRS that included a payment of the fine, 79 percent came from households making $50,000 a year or less. (Technically, the income is adjusted gross income, which understates actual income. But on average, the adjustment makes little difference for this check.) However, Thune didn’t specify that he was talking about the number of people. His description of the tax could just as equally refer to the dollars paid. The government collected a little over $3 billion from about 6.6 million households. Of that, about $1.8 billion, 60 percent, came from households with incomes under $50,000. So in dollar terms, about 60 percent of the tax fell on people in that income range, not the 80 percent that Thune said. Thune’s communications staff told us he was talking about the number of people and the number of returns. Paying by mistake We reached several health care and tax researchers, and none of them challenged the core numbers. Gordon Mermin with the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center ran the numbers and found that as a percentage of income, the tax fell heaviest on the $25,000 to $50,000 group. On average, that group paid 3.1 percent of income. Mermin told us households in this range are more likely to lack insurance, and due to their incomes, are less likely to be able to claim an exemption from the fine. "People shouldn’t be surprised the $25,000 to $50,000 group is affected the most," Mermin said. But researchers found it odd that people making less than $25,000 had paid as much as they did. The $10,000 to $25,000 group accounted for 22 percent of the payments, and about 36 percent of the households. "Folks are just making a mistake," said Jonathan Gruber, one of the architects of Obamacare and an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "Given the exemptions, there is no way such low-income folks should be paying." The IRS knows this has happened. It’s been sending out letters since 2015, telling filers "it appears that you may have reported owing too much Health Care Shared Responsibility Payment," the penalty’s formal name. "The IRS has reached out to some taxpayers to let them know they’ve overpaid the penalty, but they don’t have the capacity to do that in all cases," said Tara Straw at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning think tank. Straw said the IRS targets people who automatically qualify for an exemption because of their income, a factor that is stronger in states that did not expand Medicaid to people making 138 percent of federal poverty. Where the IRS effort falls short, she said, relates to personal circumstances such as a death in the family or a utility service cut-off notice. Larry Levitt at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a neutral source of health care data, also agreed that "there certainly appear to be some low-income people paying the penalty who could be claiming an exemption." A just-released study from Kaiser suggests the number could be large. The report found that about 5 million uninsured people could get coverage for less than the cost of the penalty. Thanks to the subsidies in Obamacare, the lowest-level plans would be free to many of those people, or if not free, available at a very low cost. If everyone took advantage of those subsidies, the 6.6 million households paying the penalty because they lack coverage would fall significantly. We don’t know how the numbers would shake out because about 4 million people neither paid the fine nor told the IRS that they had coverage. Republicans offer the repeal of the penalty as a boon to working Americans, and for some it would be. But the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan analytic arm of Congress, has found that removing the penalty makes it less likely that people will seek out insurance, even if it would be free or very affordable. Our ruling Thune said that 80 percent of the individual mandate penalty falls on those who make $50,000 a year or less. In terms of the number of returns in which people paid the fine, that figure is correct. In terms of the dollars collected, it overshoots the mark. People in that income range account for about 60 percent of the payments. Still, an independent analysis showed that households in the $25,000 to 50,000 income range paid the highest percentage of income on the penalty. There’s strong evidence that many lower income people are paying the fine by mistake, and millions could both avoid it and gain health coverage for less than the cost of the fine. But as far as who is paying the fine, we rate this claim Mostly True. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com	None	John Thune	None	None	None	2017-11-17T12:03:04	2017-11-15	['None']
pomt-06280	Says Barack Obama said, "If we keep talking about the economy, we’re going to lose."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/22/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-obama-said-if-we-keep-talking-abo/	On the eve of a presidential trip to New Hampshire on Nov. 22, 2011, Mitt Romney’s campaign released an ad targeting President Barack Obama. In the ad, the Romney campaign used a quote that prompted an immediate counterattack from the Obama camp, which argued that it had been taken out of context. The 60-second ad, called "Believe in America," is designed to contrast "candidate Obama from 2008 with President Obama of today," highlighting "his failures in between," according to the Romney campaign. The ad contrasts a 2008 campaign speech by Obama with text on the screen that criticizes Obama’s economic record, including, "Greatest Jobs Crisis Since Great Depression," "Record Home Foreclosures" and "Record National Debt." The ad then has a clip of Obama saying,"If we keep talking about the economy, we’re going to lose." The clear implication is that Obama believes that his economic record is so bad that he will lose in 2012 unless he can steer the conversation away from the economy. But the Obama camp, among others, immediately charged that the clip was taken out of context. Was it? Here’s what Obama said in the October 2008 speech, which came about two weeks before he defeated Sen. John McCain: "Even as we face the most serious economic crisis of our time, even as you are worried about keeping your jobs or paying your bills or staying in your homes, my opponent's campaign announced earlier this month that they want to ‘turn the page’ on the discussion about our economy so they can spend the final weeks of this election attacking me instead," Obama said in the speech. "Sen. McCain's campaign actually said, and I quote, ‘If we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose.’" So the comment is drastically different than the way it's portrayed in the Romney ad. Obama was actually saying that his opponent’s campaign three years earlier had said, "If we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose." That context is not included in the Romney ad -- and leaving it out sends a profoundly different message. The Romney camp seems to have anticipated this complaint. In a blog post published around the time the ad was released, Romney spokeswoman Gail Gitcho acknowledged that, "Three years ago, candidate Barack Obama mocked his opponent’s campaign for saying, ‘If we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose.’" She went on to say Obama is trying to distract voters from his economic record. Our ruling We certainly think it’s fair for Romney to attack Obama for his response to the economy. And the Romney camp can argue that Obama’s situation in 2011 is ironic considering the comments he made in 2008. But those points could have been made without distorting Obama’s words, which have been taken out of context in a ridiculously misleading way. We rate the Romney ad’s portrayal of Obama’s 2008 comments Pants on Fire.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2011-11-22T13:34:24	2011-11-21	['None']
pomt-05760	Says there’s no proven instance where hydraulic fracking has polluted groundwater.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2012/feb/29/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-theres-no-proven-instance-groundwa/	Before he suspended his candidacy for president, Texas Gov. Rick Perry gave a spirited defense of fracking, a process that extracts natural gas from thousands of feet underground. "You cannot show me one place where there is a proven – not one – where there is a proven pollution of groundwater by hydraulic fracking," Perry told a college student who raised the topic at a December 18, 2011, stop in Decorah, Iowa, according to the Texas Tribune. Not one? Perry’s sweeping claim tracks with the November 2011 release of preliminary findings of a study by the University of Texas Energy Institute. A November 10, 2011, Austin American-Statesman news article quoted the study’s leader, UT geologist Charles "Chip" Groat, saying hydraulic fracturing "doesn’t seem to be of concern to groundwater." Groat said the study had looked at regulatory violations and frameworks in states with major shale drilling operations, including Texas, Louisiana, New York and Pennsylvania. "The violations that we've seen are of no, minor or small impact," he said. Perry’s claim also echoed more than 25 others made by regulatory officials, as compiled by a pro-drilling group, as well as a May 2011 assessment by the head of the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA’s administrator, Lisa Jackson, was asked at a May 24, 2011, hearing of the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform whether hydraulic fracturing can affect aquifers and water supplies. Jackson replied: "There is evidence that it can certainly affect them. I am not aware of any proven case where the fracking process itself has affected water." The "fracking process itself"? Fracking might be fun to say, but it’s a little slippery to define. Both Jackson and Perry were using a very specific definition of fracking, their spokeswomen told us by email, referring only to the step in the process where the shale rock is fractured. In high-pressure hydraulic fracturing for natural gas, a mix of water, sand and chemicals is shot down into the well, bursting out of holes in the pipe lining the well and cracking the gas-bearing shale rock. Gas then flows from the cracks back up the pipe for collection. The immense increase in fracking since the mid-2000s came about because companies began to use this process in horizontally drilled wells, which cost more but also reach more of the layer of shale that lies as deep as two miles below the earth’s surface. But the energy industry and environmental groups use the term fracking in very different ways. Fracking expert Terry Engelder, a professor of geosciences at Pennsylvania State University, mapped out the two positions for us. "Industry likes to restrict the use of the term hydraulic fracturing to just that process taking place underground during which time high-pressure water opens natural cracks or creates new cracks at the depths of the reservoir rock," Engelder told us by email. Conversely, Engelder said, opponents of drilling "consider fracking to encompass the entire process from leasing land through drilling and sending natural gas to market." PolitiFact Ohio acknowledged as much in a July 14, 2011, article. Evidence supported an Ohio lawmaker’s claim that state agencies had no proof of groundwater contamination from fracking, though the statement was rated Mostly True because in one case, a state panel found that a well’s cement casing allowed gas to seep into water wells (and up into homes, causing an explosion). Even by the narrow definition, some environmentalists say that EPA reports from 1987 and 2011 prove that fracking has contaminated water. The 1987 report (unearthed last year by the national nonprofit Environmental Working Group) said that "residual" fracking fluid "migrated" into a private water well after a nearby gas well had been fractured in West Virginia. The Dec. 8, 2011, preliminary report found fracking was a possible cause of groundwater contamination in Pavilion, Wyo., where a company was fracking inside an aquifer -- an unusual case, according to the report. EPA spokeswoman Betsaida Alcantara offered us no comment on the 1987 report, though an Aug. 4, 2011, news story by an independent nonprofit news organization, ProPublica, quotes an unidentified EPA official as saying the agency was reviewing that case. The 2011 report, Alcantara told us, "tentatively found a link between groundwater contamination in an aquifer with hydraulic fracturing. The report is not final and it will now go through independent scientific review." Also using the narrow definition, other regulatory officials said they did not know of groundwater pollution by fracking. The Texas Railroad Commission regulates fracking in Texas. Commission spokeswoman Gaye Greever McElwain told us, "Commission records do not indicate a single documented water contamination case associated with the process of hydraulic fracturing in Texas. Similarly, an official with the National Groundwater Protection Council told us in a telephone interview that fracking has not been proven to contaminate groundwater. Mike Paque, executive director of the council comprising groundwater regulators and oil/gas regulators from state agencies, said the depth at which shale is fractured makes contamination by fracking itself practically impossible. "There’s no water down there to drink," Paque said. "Private wells go a couple hundred feet down, and these are 11,000 feet down. So the fact that people say that, and that my state regulatory agencies say that, and the drinking water agencies say that, is correct, period." To get our own fix on possible water pollution by fracking, we examined lists of incidents that were described as fracking-related by EarthJustice, a nonprofit law firm; the National Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy nonprofit group; and ThinkProgress, a blog run by the American Progress Action Fund, a liberal think-tank. Because we were seeking "proven" groundwater contamination, we first eliminated claims not related to water pollution and accounts that did not include independent evidence, such as a state investigation or newspaper story. Of the remaining 56 claims of groundwater contamination, not a single one fit the "industry" definition of fracking -- the one Perry was using, his spokeswoman, Lucy Nashed, told us. Yet how close to that step in the process were they? We identified 11 incidents that appeared to be both substantiated by outside evidence and linked to an essential part of the process of hydraulically fracturing a well. The 11 included events such as fracking fluid leaking from wastewater pits or from pipe lining a fracked well. Several were "blowouts," which Engelder defined for us as the (normally controlled) process in which "high pressure gas blows fracking water out of the well to clear the way for natural gas production." A few examples: February 2008, Parachute, Colo. -- A ProPublica news story says a state agency confirmed a 200-foot frozen waterfall of fracking fluid that melted into the Colorado River. August 2008, Dimock, Pa. -- A Vanity Fair news story says that after fracking began nearby, the state shut down water wells and fined a company $360,000 for "contaminating Dimock’s groundwater and failing to fix the leaks that caused the problem." April 2010, Caddo Parish, La. -- A ProPublica news story says parish residents were evacuated and told not to drink their water after a blowout at a nearby fracking well. November 2011, Leroy, Pa. -- A (Wilkes-Barre) Times Leader news story says an energy company confirmed that equipment failure allowed a 30,000-gallon spill of fracking fluid, some into a tributary of the Susquehanna River. The two views of fracking seem irreconcilable. Jason Pitt, a spokesman for the Sierra Club, told us by email: "Fracking is just one small part of an overall industrial process to extract natural gas. When speaking about ground water contamination, it is very misleading to refer back to just the fracking process." He said there are many cases of water contamination "that have occurred as a result of natural gas extraction across the country." Engelder, the Penn State geologist, disagreed. "Anti-drillers," he said, "have lots of proof of spills and leaks and other stuff including noise pollution and so forth because they consider fracking to be the all-encompassing, creeping industrialization of rural areas." Attempts to tie events such as surface spills to hydraulic fracturing miss the point, he said. "Fracking is such a toxic word in the English language that Americans are blaming all sorts of bad things on it when, in fact, Governor Perry was using the term hydraulic fracturing correctly in his comment." Our ruling Perry’s comment, focused on "proven" incidents of groundwater polluted by the specific step of breaking the shale rock, holds up. However, the definition of fracking is debated -- and if we rope in all incidents that take place at such wells, there have been more than a few reported incidents of groundwater contamination. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2012-02-29T15:28:19	2011-12-18	['None']
pomt-04214	"Our race was the closest U.S. Senate race in Ohio in 36 years -- when Howard Metzenbaum defeated Robert Taft in 1976."	true	/ohio/statements/2012/nov/30/josh-mandel/josh-mandel-says-his-senate-contest-sherrod-brown-/	Close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades, but it can provide a bit of consolation in politics. Strategists like Karl Rove, whose two Republican-allied super PACs -- American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS -- were among the biggest spenders in the campaign season just ended, suggested that their spending kept a number of races closer than they otherwise might have been. Among the races, and one of the 10 Senate contests in which Crossroads GPS invested, was the match between Democratic incumbent Sherrod Brown and the Republican state treasurer, Josh Mandel. Crossroads GPS contributed nearly $6.4 million to the unsuccessful effort to defeat Brown, making it the biggest third-party spender in a race that was one of the nation's costliest, according to figures gathered by the nonprofit Sunlight Foundation. Mandel, in an email thanking his supporters, said one of them had pointed out "that our race was the closest U.S. Senate race in Ohio in 36 years -- when Howard Metzenbaum defeated Robert Taft in 1976." True? PolitiFact Ohio couldn't resist an excuse to dig into history. We looked first at current unofficial election results from Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted. They show Brown defeated Mandel by 278,052 ballots, or 50.35 percent of the vote to Mandel's 45.06 percent. Then we checked the official record on the secretary's website. Of the 11 Senate races going back to 1976, none was as close as the Brown-Mandel match. Most were comparatively lopsided, in fact, including Brown's victory margin of more than 12 percent in 2006. In 1976, Metzenbaum defeated Robert Taft Jr., the Republican incumbent, by a margin of 117,339 votes, or 3 percent of the vote. Not only closer than the Brown-Mandel race, it was a reverse rematch of the 1970 election in which Taft reached the Senate, defeating Metzenbaum by a margin of 70,420 votes, or 2 percent. Taft was a congressman, father of the former governor and son of the famed three-term senator who was nicknamed "Mr. Republican." Before his two tight contests with Metzenbaum, he lost his first bid for the Senate in an even closer race. In 1964, the year of Lyndon Johnson's presidential landslide over Barry Goldwater, Taft lost to incumbent Democrat Stephen Young by just 0.5 percent. It was Ohio's closest Senate election of the last half century. PolitiFact Ohio found the history interesting. On the Truth-O-Meter, Mandel’s statement rates True.

pomt-08351	"As a state representative, David Cicilline argued against Megan's Law and voted against mandatory registration of sex offenders."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2010/oct/27/americans-commonsense-solutions/cicilline-argued-against-megans-law-and-voted-agai/	A new round of attack ads in the race to replace U.S. Rep. Patrick Kennedy is not a product of one campaign or the other; it comes from a little-known political organization known as Americans For Common Sense Solutions. On its website, the group describes itself as a local operation run out of downtown Providence. Christopher Stenberg, named on the website as the group's executive director, did not return multiple calls, nor could we find any office affiliated with his name at several Westminster Street addresses. The group registered in July with the Internal Revenue Service as a 527 non-profit organization. It has not registered with the Federal Election Commission which would be required if it were supporting a particular candidate. But its strongly worded advertisements on TV and radio leave no doubt about the organization's disdain for Democrat David Cicilline, who is running for the seat against Republican John Loughlin. In the radio spot, a woman's voice says: "Even though Republicans and Democrats fight about almost everything, they didn't fight about this. Except David Cicilline. As a state representative, David Cicilline argued against Megan’s Law and voted against mandatory registration of sex offenders. "We don't know why David Cicilline took a position to protect sexual predators and we don't know if he will argue or vote against other common sense legislation if he becomes a congressman." Megan's Law is the colloquial name for state laws that require the police to provide information to the public about sex offenders. That includes mandatory registration of sex offenders and notification to residents when a sex offender moves into the neighborhood. The law was named for Megan Kanka, a 7-year-old who was raped and murdered in 1994 in New Jersey by a convicted sex offender who moved to her neighborhood after being released from prison. The statutes governing Megan's Law differ from state to state. In 1996, Rhode Island lawmakers took the existing sex offender registration law, which required convicted offenders to register with local police departments, and added language requiring police to notify the community. That vote took place while Cicilline, now the mayor of Providence, was still a state representative. So how did he vote? The short answer is, he was one of three representatives who voted against it. But Cicilline's campaign now says the candidate opposed the bill because it applied to teenagers as well as adults. In other words, "if a 13-year-old touches another 13-year-old, he could be required to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life," Eric Hyers, a Cicilline spokesman told us. To say Cicilline "argued against Megan's Law" is "a disgusting and vile claim" if you don't explain that his objections were limited to one particular section, Hyers said. It's difficult to verify what prompted Cicilline's no vote nearly 15 years ago. A Providence Journal story on the issue indicated that Cicilline indeed spoke up about his concerns that adolescent offenders would face long-term consequences. He was quoted as saying "I don't know that it will do anything to protect our children" from molesters. The General Assembly did not start videotaping its sessions until several years later and the legislative Journal from that day merely says Rep. Cicilline engaged in a debate about the bill, without providing details. The bill's journey did not end there. Three years later, in 1999, Megan's Law was amended to limit community notification to adult offenders, thereby carving out an exception for teenage offenders, the group Cicilline had concerns about. This time, the Providence representative voted in favor of it. When the law was further altered in small ways two more times during Cicilline's tenure in the legislature, in 2000 and 2002, he again voted in the affirmative. The record shows that Cicilline voted against Megan's Law when it first passed. But his later votes suggest that he either had a change of heart, or, as his spokesman tells us, he found the bill more palatable once teenagers were excluded. The ad from Americans for Common Sense Solutions is misleading. It doesn't mention what Cicilline's objections were to the original law, nor that he subsequently voted in favor of it three times. PolitiFact's definition of a Barely True statement says it "contains some element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression." That sounds right to us. Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-07966	Says the first word spoken from the moon was "Houston."	false	/texas/statements/2011/jan/22/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-first-word-spoken-moon-was-houston/	Gov. Rick Perry praised Texans for their "resilience" and "resourcefulness" during his Jan. 18 inauguration speech, saying that "if something has never been done before, it's just because we haven't tried it." Among the accomplishments Perry credited to Texans was pioneering space. "Matter of fact," he said, "the first word spoken from the moon was 'Houston.' " That statement drew shouts and applause from the crowd — and our attention. We'd heard the boast before. Last year, for instance, Reagan Outdoor Advertising placed this message — "Houston" First Word Spoken On The Moon — on billboards in the Salt Lake City area. We saw them in Austin, too. We also read the statement in several articles, including a 2001 Philadelphia Inquirer travel story about Texas' largest city. All refer to the instantly historic line uttered July 20, 1969, by NASA astronaut Neil Armstrong to a worldwide television and radio audience and the folks in mission control at the Johnson Space Center in Houston after he and fellow astronaut Buzz Aldrin landed the lunar module, Eagle, on the moon: "Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed." At first, we were confident that Perry had it right. However, research raised doubts — especially after we saw YouTube posts of video and audio from the landing that suggested some technical communications by the astronauts took place after the landing and before Armstrong said "Houston." We turned next to experts both in and out of NASA, including two authors of books on the Apollo 11 mission and the editor of the Apollo Lunar Surface Journal, an online resource that's featured on NASA's website. The Journal includes a transcript of everything said by the astronauts and NASA officials on the ground. What was the first word said by man on the moon? The experts' answers differed, with most agreeing it was not "Houston." David Harland — author of The First Men on the Moon: The Story of Apollo 11 — told us by e-mail: "Technically, the first utterance would have been Aldrin saying 'contact light,' which occurred when one of the probes projecting from ... the landing legs made contact with the surface." The light alerted the astronauts when the lunar module had touched the moon. According to the Apollo Lunar Surface Journal, the next word spoken — after "contact light" — was "shutdown" by Armstrong, who was alerting Aldrin that he had turned off the engine. Andrew Chaikin, author of A Man on the Moon: The Voyages of the Apollo Astronauts, told us that he considers "shutdown" to be the first word uttered on the moon. Eric Jones — editor of the Apollo Lunar Surface Journal — agreed. He told us that after consulting the transcripts and the November 1969 NASA report on the Apollo 11 mission, he concluded that "shutdown" was the first word spoken after the lunar module landed. The next words came from Aldrin, according to the Journal transcript: "Okay. Engine stop." At NASA, spokesman Joshua Buck said this was the key moment. "After checking online, it seems that the very first word on the moon was seconds after landing and said by Buzz Aldrin. It was 'OK,'" Buck told us in an e-mail. After "engine stop," there was a brief technical exchange between Armstrong and Aldrin that Jones said was part of the post-shutdown process. Next, mission control in Houston chimed in: "We copy you down, Eagle," said Charles Duke, who was Apollo 11's capsule communicator, the only person authorized to talk directly to the crew. According to the Journal's transcript, Armstrong then said to Aldrin, "Engine arm is off," before addressing mission control directly with: "Houston ..." About 20 seconds passed — and about 30 words were spoken — between Aldrin's "contact light" and Armstrong's "Houston." Facing all these different answers to the first-word question — none of which were "Houston" — we sought clarity from Bill Barry, NASA's chief historian. No luck: Barry told us that there are "a range of right answers." He said "contact light" was one possibility because those words were uttered the moment that the module touched the surface of the moon. "The next option," he said, is the first word spoken after all four of the module's foot pads came to rest on the moon. It's not clear exactly when that happened, Barry said, but it probably occurred as the astronauts were running down their post-shutdown "checklist" — "like the one you do every day, but probably don't say aloud, when you park your car." But Barry said that because the checklist was part of a long-rehearsed procedural script, he is "inclined toward saying that the first 'intentional' words spoken on the moon were Armstrong's report to Houston that they had landed." Keeping score? That's one vote for "Houston" and four for some other words. Barry offered yet another take on the issue, saying that if you start from the moment humans stepped on the lunar surface for the first time, the first words spoken on the moon would be Armstrong's most famous statement: "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind." We had one more question for Barry: How much of the procedural exchange between the astronauts did the millions of people hear as they listened to the moon landing on radio and television? Barry told us that they would have heard everything said by Aldrin, including "contact light" and "Okay. Engine stop," because he was making all his checklist calls and observations over the radio. Armstrong's communications were captured by the on-board recorder, Barry said, but were not broadcast on the radio unless he pushed a button — as Armstrong did when he announced, "Houston ... The Eagle has landed." We laid out our research for Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier, who responded by saying: "We stand by the governor's inaugural remarks." Now, to the Truth-O-Meter. We understand the everlasting appeal of Houston as the first word flung from the moon. However, we were surprised to learn, it's not so. Armstrong's call from the moon to mission control was preceded by various other and easy-to-overlook words. We rate Perry's statement as False.

pomt-10919	Says Sherrod Brown "votes 97 percent with Chuck Schumer, almost 95 plus percent with Elizabeth Warren."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2018/jul/31/jim-renacci/ohio-senator-sherrod-brown-votes-elizabeth-warren-/	Ohio Republican U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci says his Democratic opponent Sen. Sherrod Brown votes in step with Democratic leadership and liberals. Renacci held a July 10 press conference in Cincinnati to call for term limits. "People start voting not for their state anymore but they start voting for their leadership," Renacci said. "And we have seen that with our Sen. Sherrod Brown who votes 97 percent with Chuck Schumer, almost 95 plus percent with Elizabeth Warren." Renacci was referring to the voting records of Schumer, who is the Democratic Senate leader and represents New York, as well as Warren, who represents Massachusetts and is a potential 2020 presidential contender to challenge President Donald Trump. We found that Renacci is largely correct on the numbers but we will add some context. In recent years, the average senator voted with his or her party about 90 percent of the time when a majority of Democrats took a position different from a majority of Republicans, said Steven S. Smith, Washington University political science professor. "In this context, a serious look at a senator’s record requires more digging. On what issues did the senator introduce legislation, offer amendments, address in public statements, or pursue on committee or in conference?" Brown’s voting record Renacci’s campaign pointed to vote data compiled by Congressional Quarterly, which showed that Brown voted with Schumer 96 percent of the time between 2007 and 2018. For the comparison with Warren, who joined the Senate in 2013, the Renacci campaign pulled CQ data showing Brown voted the same as Warren about 94 percent of the time. We used ProPublica’s public database which provides head-to-head comparisons, and found similar results. So the numbers aren’t in dispute. We have fact-checked several previous claims that Democrats voted with former President Barack Obama or their party the vast majority of the time and generally rated them Mostly True if the numbers were on target. Most Democrats and Republicans largely vote with their respective party, but using only the statistic doesn’t tell the full story about a senator’s record. The straight-up vote comparisons here between three Democratic senators don’t tell the full story about Brown’s voting record, either. Brown’s campaign spokesman Preston Maddock pointed to some key votes on which Brown opposed Warren. For example, in 2014, Brown voted to adopt the conference report on the farm bill and was tapped by leadership to reconcile differences between the House and the Senate. Warren was among Senate Democrats who opposed any cuts to food stamps and voted against the legislation. In 2015, Brown voted to adopt the conference report to reauthorize federal transportation programs and renew the charter of the Export-Import bank. Under the bill, Brown said Ohio was set to receive an increase in money for highway and transit projects. Warren opposed the legislation because she said it rolled back rules that protect consumers and our financial system. In 2016, Brown voted for the 21st Century Cures Act, which authorized $1 bill to states to combat the opioid crisis. Warren said the bill was "hijacked" by the pharmaceutical industry and opposed it. Brown also voted for some of Trump’s nominees in 2017 whom Warren opposed, including Ben Carson to head up Housing and Urban Development and Wilbur Ross for commerce secretary. Brown supported U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer's confirmation, while Schumer opposed him. While Brown has criticized Trump on several fronts, Maddock pointed to some examples on which the Democratic senator has been in agreement with the president. For example, Brown supported the Interdict Act to make it easier for customs officials to block fentanyl from getting into the U.S. The law passed the Senate by unanimous consent. Trump signed the House version into law, while Brown was a cosponsor of the Senate version. U.S. Sen. Rob Portman, Ohio’s Republican senator, also backed the bill, and both Portman and Brown attended a signing ceremony for the new law at the White House. Brown and Trump also share some views on trade. Brown has said Trump’s order on raising imported steel will help stabilize steel jobs in Ohio. Experts say members often vote along party lines Experts told us that it’s no surprise that senators from the same party often vote the same. "Democrats tend to vote with fellow Democrats, just as Republicans tend to vote with their party. The existence of parties and winner-take-all congressional primaries incentivizes party-line voting," University of Akron political science professor David Cohen said. The vote comparison among Democrats omits that the Senate reaches bipartisan consensus on some issues, for example, the recent unanimous vote in the Senate to express opposition to allowing the Russians to interrogate American diplomats, said University of Miami political science professor Gregory Koger. "There may be a lot of issues on which Brown disagrees with Schumer and/or Warren that do not come to the Senate floor, so their roll call voting record may overstate their actual policy agreement," Koger said. Using the ProPublica database of votes, we found that Renacci voted the same as House Majority Leader Paul Ryan about 89 percent of the time. Our ruling Renacci said Brown "votes 97 percent with Chuck Schumer, almost 95 plus percent with Elizabeth Warren." The numbers are largely correct and not in dispute. But it’s not unusual for members of the same party to vote together, and it doesn’t tell the full story about their voting record. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-06468	Between 2000 and 2010, the illegal immigrant population of Texas increased by 60 percent, while California and Florida had "no increase."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/18/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-illegal-immigrant-population-rose/	During the Oct. 18, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Las Vegas, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney sparred with one of his rivals, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, over immigration. Over the last 10 years, Romney said, California and Florida have had "no increase in illegal immigration. Texas has had 60 percent increase in illegal immigrants.... If there's someone who has a record as governor with regards to illegal immigration that doesn't stand up to muster, it's you, not me." We’ll start our analysis by noting that counting illegal immigrants is a notoriously tricky task. The U.S. Census Bureau doesn’t ask for the legal status of the people it interviews, so independent groups need to approximate the numbers of foreign-born individuals who are believed to be unauthorized, based on factors such as gender, age, country of origin and year of entry into the U.S. According to experts we contacted, there are two sources that produce credible estimates: the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Immigration Statistics and the Pew Hispanic Center. Both of these organizations have produced numbers that are broadly similar to Romney’s claim. First, the numbers for Texas. The DHS estimated that Texas had 1,090,000 unauthorized immigrants in 2000, rising to an estimated 1,770,000 by 2010 -- an increase of 680,000, or about 62 percent, over the decade. Meanwhile, Pew estimated the numbers to be 1,100,000 in 2000 and 1,650,000 in 2010 (the midpoint of a range between 1,450,000 to 1,850,000). That’s an increase of 550,000, or exactly 50 percent. The difference between 50 percent and 62 percent is "well within the margin of error of any of these estimates," said Jeffrey S. Passel, a senior demographer at Pew who helped assemble the estimate. So the 60 percent increase Romney cited is broadly supported by the best estimates available. What about the numbers for California and Florida over the same period? According to the DHS figures, California had a 2 percent increase, while Florida had a 5 percent decrease. So Romney’s slightly off when he claims that California had "no increase," but he has a point that both states were broadly stable over the period. Meanwhile, when rating promises of these sort, we always try to look not only at whether the facts are accurate, but also whether the public official being credited or blamed for the statistic has significant authority over the issue. In the case of immigration, governors have limited influence. "There are certain trends with respect to illegal immigration that are beyond the ability of any single state policymaker to counteract," said Michelle Mittelstadt, director of communications for the Migration Policy Institute, which studies immigration issues. In addition, she said, "border enforcement is almost entirely in the federal realm, and only federal policymakers can set the parameters for who has legal status in this country." Still, Mittelstadt added, some states in recent years "have taken on a greater role in immigration enforcement and policymaking, and state and local executives play a significant role in determining how welcoming or hostile their jurisdictions are perceived to unauthorized immigrants." For instance, she said that under Perry, Texas has "asserted a growing role for itself at the border." Meanwhile, Ira Mehlman-- the media director for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group that seeks to stop illegal immigration -- added that while Perry has focused on border enforcement in Texas, he has not gone as far as, say, Arizona in "removing incentives to come [il legally]," including access to jobs and benefits -- "the most important factors in controlling illegal immigration." Our ruling Romney is essentially correct on the numbers, but his strong implication that Perry is responsible is a significant stretch. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.

pomt-03246	Says Matt Bevin has repeatedly failed to pay his taxes.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/14/mitch-mcconnell/mitch-mcconnell-tags-kentucky-primary-opponent-tax/	The 2014 Kentucky Senate race will ultimately be a referendum on Republican versus Democratic policies, but before we get to that point, the state’s senior senator, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell must first get through the GOP primary. He faces a challenge from well-to-do businessman and tea party activist Matt Bevin. In a state that elected Sen. Rand Paul, a magnet for the libertarian wing of the Republican Party, McConnell is treating this as a real challenge. McConnell’s latest ad is called "Delinquent" and it casts Bevin as a man who repeatedly fails to pay his taxes and then denies the habit. Here’s the key text from the ad: Announcer: Bevin says (video clip) "I have no tax delinquency problem, nor have I ever." Announcer: But Bevin’s business failed to pay taxes at least eight times. And was the No. 1 tax delinquent. Bevin also failed to pay taxes on his million-dollar home in Maine. Despite official documents, Bevin says (video clip) "I have no tax delinquency problem nor have I ever." Announcer: Bailout Bevin. How can you believe him on anything? We contacted the McConnell campaign, and they told us that the business that didn’t pay taxes is Bevin Brothers Manufacturing in East Hampton, Conn. Bevin Brothers makes bells -- cow bells, brass hand bells, door bells, sleigh bells and so on. It’s been making bells since 1832 and on its website, it speaks with pride of being the "only remaining company manufacturing just bells in the United States." The Bevin family has overseen the firm for six generations. Matt Bevin became wealthy managing the portfolios of institutional investors. An uncle in Connecticut owned and ran Bevin Brothers. According to a letter provided by the Bevin campaign, the factory foreman, Doug Dilla, contacted Matt Bevin in 2008 and asked him to intervene to save the company. The uncle was ill, and the firm "was in debt and not meeting its obligations," Dilla wrote. Dilla wrote that letter in July 2013 at the Bevin campaign’s request. The McConnell campaign sent us copies of tax records showing the bell maker had fallen behind on paying taxes eight times. The amounts ranged from $21 to over $74,000. That big bill was owed to the Internal Revenue Service, and the record shows that the company failed to pay what it owed in 2008 and in the second quarter of 2009. The question is, as our colleagues at the Washington Post Fact Checker pointed out in their analysis of this ad, can Matt Bevin be held accountable for those unpaid taxes? The IRS lien document is consistent with the storyline of a company facing hard times around 2008. There is no record of Matt Bevin having managerial control of the firm before that point and the extent of his involvement afterward is unclear. According to the Bevin campaign, he began putting money into the bell maker starting in 2008. His uncle remained in charge, at least formally, until August 2011 when the board elected him president and treasurer. The campaign provided an unsigned copy of the shareholder resolution; the signed original, they said, was lost in a major fire at the plant in 2012. The East Hampton town manager, Mike Maniscalco, told us that from what he and other town officials can tell, all those details are accurate. "The company was definitely struggling, and we are grateful that Mr. Bevin got involved," Maniscalco said. "After the fire, the company had offers from other communities to reopen elsewhere and thankfully, they made the decision to stay and are cranking out bells today." Maniscalco also affirmed that he wrote a letter to the campaign in which he described Bevin’s successful efforts to pay all back taxes. The ad’s claim that Bevin Brothers Manufacturing had become the area’s top tax delinquent is accurate but is due mainly to the town’s tax base. Residential property taxes account for over 90 percent of revenues; when the bell maker fell behind, the amount it owed stood out. The house in Maine The ad’s final assertion is that Bevin failed to pay taxes on his million-dollar home in Maine. That is accurate but incomplete. In 2007, Bevin did not pay $5,761.07 in property taxes on a home he bought for $1,250,000 in 2001. The house is in the town of Greenwood, Maine. The town’s tax collector, Kimberly Sparks, told us that Bevin had paid his taxes on time every year before 2007 and afterward as well. When Bevin bought the house in 2001, the lender was American Bank and Trust. Typically, along with a mortgage comes an escrow agent that pays the tax bill. Sparks said that sometime around 2007, the lender and escrow agent changed to National City Corporation. "A lot of times we see that when there’s a change in escrow agents," Sparks said, "property taxes don’t get paid. That’s a common occurrence." Sparks said the town sends the tax bill to the property owner, and it is up to the owner to forward it to the escrow agent. The McConnell campaign provided a copy of the tax notice sent to Bevin’s Louisville address and noted "the lien was sent to his house in Louisville, so it would have been hard to miss." In 2008, National City was collapsing in the sub-prime mortgage debacle and was purchased by PNC Financial Services. The extent to which that was a factor is unclear. According to a letter Sparks wrote at the request of the Bevin campaign, Bevin contacted the town in 2009 "concerned that his accounts were paid by his new mortgage company" and "was surprised to learn of two tax liens." By February 2009, National City Mortgage paid the back taxes. Our ruling The McConnell campaign ad paints a picture of Matt Bevin as a man with a track record of unpaid taxes. The claim is based on back taxes owed by a bell-making company in Connecticut that was owned by members of the Bevin family, and Bevin’s failure to pay taxes on a vacation house in Maine. With the bell maker, based on the paper trail and interviews, it’s reasonable to conclude that the company was in financial trouble before Bevin was deeply involved. We don’t know all the details of Bevin’s management role, but the town credits him for helping the firm pay its tax bills and later, keeping the business afloat. McConnell’s team says this was Bevin’s business and he was responsible for its failure to pay taxes. But the weight of evidence says he inherited the tax liabilities; the town doesn’t hold him responsible for the nonpayment of taxes, and in fact, regards him in exactly the opposite light. This makes it difficult to see where the McConnell claim holds up. As for the house in Maine, Bevin showed a lapse in overseeing the property tax payments, but the change in mortgage companies at a time when the lender was headed toward bankruptcy is a significant factor. According to local officials, Bevin took the initiative to correct the problem. In both cases, there is a slim element of truth but the rest of the facts paint a very different picture. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Mitch McConnell	None	None	None	2013-08-14T10:42:06	2013-08-05	['None']
pomt-03094	If the government shuts down, "all military personnel will continue to serve and accrue pay but will not actually be paid until appropriations are available."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/24/cw-bill-young/rep-young-says-military-pay-would-be-delayed-durin/	U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young, R-Fla., and other House Republicans oppose Obamacare and recently approved a measure to fund the government only if President Barack Obama’s signature health care law, the Affordable Care Act, is defunded. But while addressing the House on Friday, the longest-serving Republican in Congress called the House plan a "painful and inefficient way to govern," and cautioned his peers against a government shutdown. Young included impact on the military in his list of examples of what would happen should the shutdown come to pass. "All military personnel will continue to serve and accrue pay but will not actually be paid until appropriations are available," he said. We wanted to see how soldiers’ wallets would be impacted if the government shuts down. First, let’s review shutdown logistics. If the president and Congress can’t agree on funding for the new fiscal year, federal agencies can’t operate, except in emergencies. The last shutdowns were in 1995 and 1996. In November 1995, the shutdown lasted five days, which was not long enough to affect military pay. From mid December 1995 to early January 1996, a 21-day shutdown occurred, which would have affected paychecks, if not for defense appropriations enacted on Dec. 1 that made funding available. This time around, however, no such budget appropriations have been passed, or at least not yet. Cmdr. Bill Urban, a U.S. Department of Defense spokesman, said there is still enough time for the government to pass them. Back in January, Sens. Mark Udall, D-Colo., and Jerry Moran, R-Kan., introduced legislation that would allow both troops and civilians to get paid in the event of a shutdown, but the bill never made it out of committee. Urban said the Defense Department was making plans based on its past experience with government shutdowns. In April 2011, before Congress narrowly avoided a government shutdown, the department announced that the military would continue to work but would be paid retroactively. That would likely be the same plan this time around. If the government shutdown does occur on Sept. 30, military members would receive their Oct. 1 paychecks on time, but Oct. 15 paychecks would be delayed. We should note that civilians who work for the Defense Department wouldn’t fare as well, based on the 2011 report. Many would go on unpaid furlough during a shutdown. "It would put a good bit of stress on an already stressed workforce," Urban said. Our ruling Though Young supported a House measure to defund Obamacare, he’s now urging the House to avoid a government shutdown, reminding fellow members of how that affects military pay. A Defense Department official said the department’s plan will be similar to plans from past threats of government shutdowns. That means the military would delay paychecks. Young’s claim is that the military cannot be paid without appropriations is correct. We rate his statement True.	None	C.W. Bill Young	None	None	None	2013-09-24T17:12:38	2013-09-20	['None']
pomt-05588	"Last year, we produced 14 percent less oil on public lands than we did the year before."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2012/apr/02/rob-portman/rob-portman-says-oil-production-public-lands-was-d/	Everyone complains about gasoline prices. President Barack Obama says he’s trying to do something about them, including making the country less reliant on foreign oil. Republicans say he should do a lot more to spur domestic oil and gas production. PolitiFact has reviewed some of Obama’s energy measures before, including his claim that U.S. energy production is at an eight-year high. But there’s a counter-claim by many Republicans that was ripe for exploration when Sen. Rob Portman mentioned it on March 26, 2012. During a radio interview with Fox News Radio, Portman said: "The president says, you know, ‘we're doing more.’ Well, on public lands, we're doing less. Last year, we produced 14 percent less oil on public lands than we did the year before. We should be doing more on public lands, and that's the outer continental shelf and what's going on in Alaska and so on." Portman’s press secretary, Christine Mangi, steered us to an article published online by Greenwire, a news service that covers energy issues. The article, posted on March 14, was on the state of energy exploration and was based on testimony and statements U.S. Bureau of Land Management director Bob Abbey made before a panel of Senate appropriators. The article made its point in the first paragraph: "Energy firms face fewer costs and regulatory obstacles when drilling on state and private lands than they do on public lands, where oil production fell last year, a top Obama administration official said today," Abbey also told the lawmakers, according to the article, that oil exploration and drilling companies have migrated to nonpublic lands for economic reasons, not because of Obama policies. The article noted that, according to Interior Department statistics, oil production fell by 14 percent in fiscal year 2011 on federal lands and waters. That’s exactly what Portman said. "The dip in production occurred mostly in the Gulf of Mexico, where a moratorium on deepwater drilling stunted exploration for much of 2010 in the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon disaster," Greenwire reported. We wanted to drill down beneath the article. So we turned to transcripts of Abbey’s recent testimony in both the House and the Senate. There is no need to repeat it all here because Greenwire summed it up well, but we’ll point out one important part of the BLM chief’s testimony before Senate appropriators on March 14. From a transcript: "But no doubt the statistics would show that the U.S. oil and gas production is up and last year it's more -- last year more oil is produced in this country than any time since 2003 according to... (CROSSTALK) And the, you know, no doubt the aggressive development of shale gas and shale oil has led to a shift to private lands in the east and to the south where there is less amount of federal mineral estate in those sections of the country." He added that where oil and gas companies decide to develop "is up to them. For example, we have approved 7,000 applications for permits to drill that are not being drilled. We have over 25 million acres of lands that we've leased that are not being developed. So it's a decision that's being based and (CROSSTALK) by the market." As for the Gulf of Mexico, Abbey acknowledged the effect of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion, and of safety measures taken that slowed the issuance of new permits. But he said permitting has speeded up -- that trend, too, has been documented -- and added that the "administration must strike the proper balance between the speed of processing and ensuring that industry is drilling responsibly and safely especially in the context of the largest oil spill in our nation's history which we saw with the Deepwater Horizon incident." Putting aside the reason for the decrease, it appeared that Portman was accurate when he said oil production was down on public lands last year. But there was one more thing we wanted to check: The actual number. For that, we turned to the Interior Department’s Office of Natural Resources Revenue and the U.S. Energy Information Administration. ONRR tracks royalties to the government for oil, gas and coal produced on federal lands, including oil from offshore wells. Using online records of royalty revenue, it is possible to estimate the amount of oil, gas and coal produced onshore and offshore on federal property in any fiscal year. Much more easily understood, and with similar results, is a recent report from EIA titled, "Sales of Fossil Fuels Produced from Federal and Indian Lands, FY 2003 through FY 2011." EIA worked with ONRR to produce the report. These numbers go directly to Portman’s claim. In 2010, EIA data show, 726 million barrels of oil came from federal lands, including offshore wells. In 2011, it was 626. That’s a drop of 13.77 percent, which can be rounded to 14 percent. This data, as well as a more complex measure (it involves royalties and British thermal units of energy, but we’ll spare you), would appear to render Portman’s statement accurate. Yet it’s worth noting that oil statistics can be used to make a somewhat different argument about drilling and exploration. From 2009 to 2010, offshore oil production rose by 14.9 percent. Prior to that, before Obama’s presidency, the offshore volume fell for several years, and it was erratic even during a phase in which it rose, EIA figures show. Yet onshore oil production generally rose on federally owned land -- and did again in 2011, by 3.7 percent. What does this say? To the White House, it says oil production on all public land is up; that it’s getting better and better on private land, where oil companies are chasing the boom in horizontal fracking; and that even last year’s drop on federal property, chiefly in the Gulf of Mexico, shouldn’t be regarded as a lack of commitment to offshore drilling Making this case more forcefully, the White House on March 15 issued a blog post (to which we were pointed by the Interior Department) that broke the figures for oil production on public lands and water into annual averages over three-year periods. The most recent average, during the Obama presidency, was 661.7 millions of barrels of oil. That compares with an annual average of 585.3 million barrels during President George W. Bush’s last three years. The point of presenting it this way? The White House was able to show a 13 percent improvement over the previous administration. So did the United States produce 14 percent less oil on its public lands last year, as Portman said? Yes. Was his statement made in a context of needing to do more, or more specifically, of this president not doing enough? Yes. He lent his voice to the ongoing debate of whether to allow more drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, in Alaska, and off the intercontinental shelf of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Fair enough. The White House points to the broader measure of all oil production, including on private land, to show an improvement. That, too, is fair. But experts agree that most big boosts in production come from years of earlier exploration and drilling. Much of the current success was seeded under a different administration, just as Obama’s actions are expected to bear fruit later. And at least part of the drop on public lands last year was due to the Deepwater Horizon disaster and oil spill and, according to BLM, an apparent shift by oil companies to private lands ripe for fracking. That leaves us here: Portman’s fact was accurate: There was a 14 percent drop on public lands. Everything else can be teased out and spun for either party’s purposes. Under PolitiFact guidelines, when a statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, it rates a Truth-o-Meter rating of Mostly True.

Now he's for them."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/05/mitt-romney/mccain-switched-on-tax-cuts/	Romney is right that McCain switched on the tax cuts. When the cuts were first proposed in 2001, McCain joined Democrats in voting against them. At the time, he said the tax breaks didn't do enough for the middle class, and because of a need for increased defense spending. In 2003, the phased-in cuts of 2001 were accelerated but McCain again voted no, saying taxes shouldn't be cut in time of war. But in 2006, when the cuts were extended, McCain voted yes because he said opposing the extension of cuts already in place would amount to a tax increase.

pomt-04138	The so-called doc fix in the fiscal cliff deal will cut payments "for treating illnesses disproportionately impacting minorities, including end stage renal disease and diabetes."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2013/jan/04/marcia-fudge/marcia-fudge-claims-fiscal-cliff-deal-included-cut/	If you read about the fiscal-cliff deal Congress made on New Year’s Day, one fact above others stood out. Through compromises -- more unsavory or unprincipled to some than to others -- America’s economy did not topple over. Neither side got everything it wanted, noted U.S. Rep. Marcia Fudge, a Warrensville Heights Democrat who voted for the deal. One compromise in particular still leaves Fudge uneasy: the funding measures used to keep Medicare from cutting its pay to physicians by 26.5 percent. To avert the physician pay cuts, Congress diverted money from several other medical programs, Fudge said in a Jan. 1 news release. This took care of the so-called Medicare doc fix -- but it also happened to take money from programs that pay for "treating illnesses disproportionately impacting minorities, including end stage renal disease and diabetes," Fudge said. She said this must be addressed in the new session of Congress. Did Congress really get the money to keep paying doctors for treating seniors (via Medicare,) by cutting what it pays hospitals and others for treating diabetes and other diseases? PolitiFact Ohio took a look. It turns out that Fudge, who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus, was correct on the funding. Whether this will harm patients is a matter of debate. Government accountants have wanted some of these changes for some time. Hospitals say the bean counters miss the big picture -- the real cost of treating patients -- by focusing too narrowly on line items. To understand this, let’s start with a quick explanation of the doc fix. It is a remnant of laws, the most recent in 1997, designed to hold down federal spending by linking the nation’s rate of economic growth to government payments for providers in Medicare, the 1965 program that brought federal health insurance to retirees. The problem is, medical costs often rise much faster than the overall economy (measured by the gross domestic product). In recent, low-inflation years, the formula linking the two would automatically require payment cuts to doctors. Some doctors who serve seniors say they might get paid so little that they would stop accepting new patients or quit practicing. So Congress halts these reductions every year, though it keeps the law. This year’s cut would have been particularly deep because of the cumulative build-up of past deferrals. But as we said, Congress found a fix. It required coming up with about $30 billion to pay. Where did the money come from? According to the Kaiser Health News blog, Congress decided to cut the amount that Medicare pays to hospitals for inpatient or overnight care by reducing annual base payment increases. This would save $10.5 billion over 10 years, the Kaiser news service said. Congress found another $4.2 billion by reducing what are known as ‘disproportionate share" payments made by Medicaid, the government’s program for low-income Americans, to hospitals that treat an unusually high share of the poor. And it got $4.9 billion by changing the way it bundles payments for treating end-stage renal disease starting in 2014 There are other changes, including a requirement that companies start competing with bids to sell diabetes test supplies, ending what government auditors say are over-payments. But you get the idea. These and other cuts are detailed in reports by the medical trade press, including The Medicare NewsGroup and Becker’s Hospital Review. If this sounds like Congress took from Peter to pay Paul, the president and CEO of the Federation of American Hospitals, Chip Kahn, might agree. He put it that way to Kaiser Health News: "It is not in the best interest of patients or those who care for them to rob hospital Peter to pay for fiscal cliff Paul." The American Medical Association also expressed its concerns. Outrageous? Consider the rationale: Congressional watchdogs maintain these programs were overpaid or abused in the past, and could function in the future with less money. According to several studies and audits by the Government Accountability Office, an investigative agency that reports to Congress, hospitals were overpaid while Medicare transitioned toward paying them a bundled sum for treatment based on a patient’s disease or diagnosis. The old system paid for individual services, treatments and tests, some of them poorly coordinated and duplicative. Overpayments occurred during the transition that started in 2008. Additionally, some ambulance services were overpaid for emergency transport of diabetes patients who did not need emergency or ambulance services, according to examinations by the inspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services. By cutting such payments by 10 percent, starting next October, Congress freed up additional money for the doc fix. And the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services paid for more dialysis-related drugs -- as much as $880 million in 2011 -- than patients with kidney failure actually used, according to a December, 2012, GAO report. This was due to a bundled-payment calculation that did not account for a significant drop in the usage of certain drugs -- 23 percent lower in 2011 than in 2007, the GAO found. The GAO specifically recommended that Congress tweak the law so CMS had clear authority to alter its dialysis payment calculations. Congress did so as part of the fiscal cliff and doc fix deal. But the medical industry is unhappy about this and the other cuts. It says that the GAO failed to factor in costs for which it is never reimbursed. "Making cuts of the magnitude GAO is recommending would impose great financial strain" on smaller dialysis organizations "and could lead to fewer choices and access to care problems for patients," Katrina Russell, president of the National Renal Administrators Association, told American Medical News in December. Fudge, too, does not like this change. Her district not only includes every major hospital system in Cuyahoga County, as her communications director, Belinda Prinz, told us, but also has a significant black population. African-Americans have a disproportionately high incidence of diabetes and are 1.8 times more likely to have diabetes than non-Hispanic whites, according to the American Diabetes Association. One in four African-American women over age 55 has diabetes, Prinz said in an email, citing this and other American Diabetes Association figures. Complications can cause blindness, kidney disease, heart attacks and strokes, and amputations sometimes result -- with African-Americans 2.7 times as likely to have lower-limb amputations, the association says. So where does that leave us with Fudge’s claim? Fudge did not specifically say minorities will be harmed by the spending cuts. Her statement was factually accurate. But she suggested that harm will result, saying that cuts will be made to programs that treat diseases disproportionately affecting minorities, including end stage renal disease and diabetes." The impact is unsettled for now. The GAO and inspector general have called out some of these programs for waste or unnecessary spending. Yet Fudge is in good company -- namely, the American medical community, although like any constituency, it too has its interests to protect. Because her claim requires this additional information to fully understand, we rate it Mostly True.	None	Marcia Fudge	None	None	None	2013-01-04T06:00:00	2013-01-01	['None']
pomt-12894	Miami-Dade is "the first community in the world to break the cycle of local transmission of the Zika virus."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2017/jan/24/carlos-gimenez/miami-dade-no-1-leader-breaking-local-zika-transmi/	Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez said that in 2016 the county became a global leader in fighting the mosquito-borne Zika virus. "We were the first community in the world -- let me repeat that -- the first community and I believe the only community in the world to break the cycle of local transmission of the Zika virus," Gimenez said during his State of the County speech Jan. 18. However, Gimenez didn’t declare Zika dead forever -- he warned that the county must remain vigilant: "We may be in the off season, but that does not mean that our work is over." Gimenez, a Republican re-elected to his last term in November, has a point about local transmission. The last of the four local transmission zones were cleared in Miami-Dade by mid December 2016. However, he omitted some caveats about Zika transmission and Miami-Dade’s special circumstances compared with the rest of the world. Zika in Miami-Dade Zika has been around for decades. But the current outbreak started in 2015, when Brazil reported cases of more babies being born with abnormally small heads, a condition called microcephaly. That condition was connected to mothers infected with Zika. The Centers for Disease Control defines areas of active Zika virus transmission as having two or more locally acquired cases of Zika virus infection, within two weeks, within 1 square mile. Those cases must be in separate households, with travel and sex ruled out as potential causes. Using those guidelines, the Florida Department of Health declared active Zika transmission zones and then lifted them when 45 days passed without any new local cases in those zones. In July, the first local Zika cases were reported in Miami-Dade County. Over the next few months, the state declared four local Zika transmission zones. The state lifted the first zone, in Wynwood -- a trendy area near downtown Miami -- Sept. 19. That was the first community in the world to break local transmission, CDC spokesman Benjamin Haynes said. The state lifted the last of the four zones, in part of South Beach, on Dec. 9. But officials didn’t declare Zika entirely kicked to the curb forever; Miami-Dade remained a "cautionary area" according to the CDC. Officials warned that isolated cases could continue to appear -- the most recent one was Dec. 15. Let’s look at how Miami-Dade compared with some other areas in curbing Zika. In addition to Miami-Dade, only one other area in the United States had local Zika cases: Brownsville, Texas. Miami-Dade reported 257 cases of local transmission, while Brownsville reported six. The Texas Department of Health never declared a local transmission zone in Brownsville, but the CDC called it a "cautionary area." It’s difficult to compare Miami-Dade to other places where the Zika virus has been far more widespread. Brazil has had more than 128,000 cases and continues to battle Zika. Local transmission continues in Puerto Rico, which had more than 100 new cases this month and more than 37,000 since 2015. In Singapore, the government designated "Zika clusters" and announced that it had no more Dec. 15 after its last new case was reported Dec. 10. However, the "only place it really stopped is in Florida," said Daniel Epstein, a spokesman for the Pan American Health Organization. There were other areas in the world where Zika dropped off before it hit Miami-Dade. For example, the outbreak in French Polynesia affected an estimated 28,000 people and lasted until 2014, said Monika Gehner, a WHO spokeswoman. Some caveats While Miami-Dade got kudos from the CDC for efforts to curb Zika, experts caution that it can return, particularly when the temperature rises. It’s too early to claim elimination, said Duane J. Gubler, an emerging infectious disease expert at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore. "The absence of reported cases for a few months does not confirm the transmission cycle is broken," she said. "After a year with active surveillance, I would probably accept it." Florida also has certain advantages compared with other places of the world that have been struck by Zika, including better access to testing patients to verify that the virus is actually Zika. Also, in South Florida, with air conditioning and screens and modest mosquito density levels, transmission is less likely than countries that have less of that protection, University of Florida biostatistics professor Ira Longini said. "There is no cycle to break," he said. "Sustained transmission is impossible, but you do get small outbreaks when introductions occur." Our ruling Gimenez said Miami-Dade is "the first community in the world to break the cycle of local transmission of the Zika virus." The CDC says that Wynwood, an area in Miami, was the first to break local transmission in September. The last of four local transmission zones was lifted Dec. 9. There are some caveats about Gimenez’s claim, including that only one other county in the United States had local cases, and a far smaller number. Some other places took a far greater hit from Zika than Florida did. Experts caution that Zika cases could return to South Florida, a point Gimenez also acknowledged in his speech.

pomt-04545	"Had the online change of address been in place in 2008 an estimated 130,000 voters who cast provisional ballots could have changed their address online and voted a regular ballot."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2012/sep/28/jon-husted/jon-husted-says-online-address-tool-would-have-cut/	Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted has found himself in the crosshairs of Democrats and concerned voting groups in recent months who worry the Republican officer wasn’t doing enough to open up greater access to voting. But there was one move Husted did this summer that pushed his critics back on their heels for a fleeting moment of agreement: when the secretary announced on Aug. 9 that his staff had made it possible for registered Ohio voters to now update and change their home addresses online through his office’s web site. The goal is ultimately have fewer Ohio voters using those sometimes unreliable and uncounted provisional ballots. People who want to vote on Election Day can be turned away if their address does not match the information in polling books. The backup plan for those people is to use provisional ballots, which are set aside for verification and don’t always end up being counted later. "If voters take advantage of this new tool and update their address online, it is likely that a lot fewer of them would have to vote a provisional ballot," Husted said at a news conference at his office the day he announced the change. Aside from a few reports of glitches in using the system, the news went over well. But at the news conference that day, Husted sought to sell his idea even more by declaring that had this system been in place during the 2008 presidential election about 130,000 Ohioans who used provisional ballots might not have had to. He backed it up by blasting a news release to the masses from his office later that day. "Had the online change of address been in place in 2008 an estimated 130,000 voters who cast provisional ballots could have changed their address online and voted a regular ballot," he said in the news release. He made an identical claim in another news release Sept. 17, 2012. That seemed like a fairly bold claim to PolitiFact Ohio. Consider that the state secretary of state’s office didn’t start tracking "wrong address" as a reason for having to use a provisional ballot in its routine post-election reports until 2011. So Politifact Ohio asked the Husted’s staff for an explanation. How can you say how many people would have changed their addresses and avoided a provisional ballot in 2008 had this online address change been in effect? After all, voters have always had the chance to change their addresses in-person. The answer is Husted’s office doesn’t know — for certain. Husted’s spokesman Matt McClellan noted that the key word in the statement uttered in August by the secretary and plopped in the the news releases is "estimated". "It is just an estimate assuming that voters would have taken advantage of the opportunity to change their addresses online," McClelland said. OK, so how did you arrive at such an "estimate"? Here’s McClelland’s explanation. Pay close attention or this might feel like a confusing mathematical equation. First, the office determined what percentage of voters using a provisional ballot in this year’s primary were forced to do so because they had a wrong address. That’s 11,912 wrong addresses out of 20,062 total provisionals for a rate of 59.4 percent. Second, the office determined what percentage of voters using a provisional ballot in the November 2011 general election were forced to do so because they had an incorrect address. That’s 51,404 out of 76,525 for a rate of 67.2 percent. Next, the office looked at the number of provisionals cast in November 2008 (206,859) and multiplied that number by 67.2 percent and 59.4 percent, for totals of 139,009 and 122,874 respectively. Lastly, the office then took the average between 139,000 and 123,000 and came up with its 130,000 estimate. Follow that? "I feel pretty good about it," McClelland said, after explaining the unscientific statistical analysis applied by the secretary’s office. We at Politifact Ohio have been called a lot of things, but brilliant statisticians isn’t one of them. We asked Case Western Reserve University professor and chair of the mathematics department, Daniela Calvetti, to please weigh in. "I think it is a reasonable way of estimating how many voters would be able to take advantage of this if everyone who had a provisional ballot due to incorrect address indeed went online and changes the address electronically we would have about 130,000 voters," Calvetti said. "There is no reason to believe that the percentages would vary much because 67 percent and 59 percent are not very far (apart) in particular since one was a primary and one was a general," she said. "I think it is a sound way of making the projection." So where does that leave Husted’s claim? An independent expert backed the methodology Husted used to come up with the figure of 130,000, and the statement describes that as an estimate.

pomt-02281	"By a two-to-one margin, Rhode Islanders want to ban assault weapons and we have a very small percentage of gun owners in this state, less than 13 percent."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/apr/06/linda-finn/rhode-island-legislator-linda-finn-says-large-majo/	During debate on any contentious issue, advocates will argue that the public is on their side. That was the case during a March 18, 2014, State House rally designed to encourage the Rhode Island General Assembly to adopt stronger gun-control laws. Rep. Linda Finn, D-Middletown, used that strategy at the end of her speech. "By a two-to-one margin, Rhode Islanders want to ban assault weapons and we have a very small percentage of gun owners in this state, less than 13 percent," she said. We decided to see whether support for an assault weapons ban is really that high and the level of gun ownership in Rhode Island is really that low. PolitiFact has looked at the issue nationally, giving a Mostly True to Sen. Dianne Feinstein's 2013 comment that "No poll done this year . . . shows less than a majority to reinstate a federal ban on assault weapons." But Finn is claiming a much larger margin of support. When we contacted Finn, she sent us the results of a poll released in February 2013 in which 64 percent of Rhode Islanders said they supported banning assault weapons, 27 percent were opposed and 9 percent were not sure. Even with a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percent, that's a 2-to-1 margin. The 24-question survey of 614 voters covered a wide range of issues and was done by Public Policy Polling, a Democratic-leaning survey firm based in North Carolina. Unlike most other polling services, PPP collects its data through robocalls, in which people hear a recorded message and are asked to respond by pressing a button on their telephone. That means a lot of people -- typically 9 out of 10 -- hang up without responding. After checking with area pollsters, we couldn't find a more traditional survey of Rhode Islanders on the assault weapons issue. Finn said she thought the PPP results were similar to the results of national polls. They're not. We found a compilation of assault weapons polls at PollingReport.com and discovered that the degree of support for a ban on assault-style weapons was much less pronounced. The split was 54-42 in a May 2013 Pew study, 56-42 in an April 2013 ABC News / Washington Post survey, 51-48 in an April 2013 CNN / ORC poll, and 59-36 in a March 2013 Quinnipiac University survey. Those national results don't come close to the 2-to-1 margin of support seen in the PPP Rhode Island poll, but that shouldn't be surprising when other parts of the United States have very different attitudes toward firearms. And what about Finn's statement about the rate of gun ownership in Rhode Island? A direct state-by-state tally of gun owners is not available. In fact, it is illegal in Rhode Island for the state to maintain a gun registry. We do know that in 2013, 3,280 active concealed carry permits were issued by the Rhode Island attorney general's office. But that's only a small fraction of owners. Also last year, Rhode Island gun dealers reported doing 21,793 BCI background checks for the purchase or transfer of at least one firearm. All but 145 were approved. But that number doesn't tell you how many gun owners there are in Rhode Island because that's only for one year, each purchase might involve more than one weapon, and the same owner might be counted multiple times if he or she makes more than one purchase throughout the year. So the best information comes from surveys. Finn sent us to a webpage at About.com which reports that 12.8 percent of Rhode Island's population owns guns, and the only states where gun ownership was lower were Massachusetts, New Jersey and Hawaii. About.com says the source is the website USACarry.com. But it’s actually from a from a survey done six years earlier -- in 2001 -- by the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, which tracks health risks in the United States and is billed as "the world’s largest telephone survey." In addition, that wasn't the percentage of the population owning guns. It was the percentage of adults who said there was at least one weapon in their household. We were unable to get more recent data from the BRFSS, which asked the question in 2002 and 2004. But we found it in two studies. A 2005 paper in the journal Pediatrics reported that the 2002 rate in Rhode Island was 13.3 percent, slightly higher than what Finn reported. A 2013 paper in the American Journal of Epidemiology looked at the data from 2004, reporting a rounded-off rate of 12 percent, which conforms with what Finn said. Our ruling Rep. Linda Finn said, "By a two-to-one margin, Rhode Islanders want to ban assault weapons and we have a very small percentage of gun owners in this state, less than 13 percent." Finn's statement about how Rhode Islanders feel about the issue comes from a recent robocall poll that has not been confirmed by any other Rhode Island polls. Her statement on the rate of gun ownership in Rhode Island is based on very outdated studies. But we have not been able to find any more recent data to suggest the number has changed. Because Finn's statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-03038	"For the first time since the Korean War, total federal spending has gone down for two years in a row."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/08/dennis-ross/rep-dennis-ross-says-us-spending-has-fallen-two-st/	U.S. Rep. Dennis Ross, R-Lakeland, is one of a small group of Republicans calling for an end to the government shutdown. After all, Republicans have succeeded in reining in government spending, Ross wrote in an op-ed in the Tampa Bay Times (the parent of PolitiFact), on Oct. 7, 2013. "In the few years since I was elected to Congress in 2010, we have achieved huge savings and taken monumental steps. For the first time since the Korean War, total federal spending has gone down for two years in a row," Ross wrote, adding, "That is why I would support a continuing resolution that funds the government at sequestration levels for one year." A reader asked us whether Ross was correct that, "for the first time since the Korean War, total federal spending has gone down for two years in a row." We thought the claim was interesting, and we decided to check it out. By the most basic measure we found that Ross is right. The Korean War was an active conflict through the signing of a truce on July 26, 1953, so we counted starting in 1953. Between 1953 and 1955, federal spending fell each year, from $76.1 billion to $70.9 billion to $68.4 billion, according to the Office of Management and Budget. By 1956, spending had edged up again, to $70.6 billion. After that, spending almost always went up every year, at least until recently. It fell for one year between 1964 and 1965, and then once again between 2009 and 2010. But the only time it fell two years in a row was between 2011 and 2013. In 2011, federal outlays were $3.60 trillion. Outlays fell to $3.54 trillion in 2012, and the Congressional Budget Office projects the figure to fall to $3.46 trillion in 2013. We should note that this is not the only way to measure a claim like this. Sometimes, raw dollars aren’t an especially useful measurement for analyzing long periods of history, especially when talking about things that are growing. Inflation, population growth and economic expansion almost inevitably make the most recent year the largest ever. However, in this case, we think that using raw dollars is an acceptable measurement. That’s because reductions in spending mean swimming against the tide of inflation and growth. Our rating Ross said that, "for the first time since the Korean War, total federal spending has gone down for two years in a row." Since the 1950s, spending fell one year between 1964 and 1965, and then once again between 2009 and 2010. But the only time it fell two years in a row was between 2011 and 2013. We rate the statement True.	None	Dennis Ross	None	None	None	2013-10-08T16:20:17	2013-10-07	['None']
pomt-03992	Says "right now, we have more military spending than the next 10, 11, 12 countries combined."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/feb/10/cory-booker/cory-booker-says-us-military-spending-greater-next/	The United States must have a prepared military, but it’s not unpatriotic to say the country is spending too much money on its defense, according to Newark Mayor Cory Booker. How much money? It’s more than the military spending of up to the next 12 countries combined, the Democratic mayor said. Booker made that point on the Feb. 1 episode of HBO’s "Real Time with Bill Maher" during a panel discussion about the recent Senate hearing on Chuck Hagel’s nomination to be U.S. Defense Secretary. "The reality is we have to make sure that we have a military that’s prepared, but right now, we have more military spending than the next 10, 11, 12 countries combined, and we’ve got to start realizing that we can secure and protect ourselves, but also be responsible in the way that we do that," Booker said. "And it’s not unpatriotic to say that we’re spending too much money," the mayor added. "In fact, to me, that’s the patriotic thing to say." Booker’s claim is on target: The United States spent more on defense in 2011 than the combined total of other high-spending nations, according to data from two organizations considered to be leading authorities on worldwide military spending. The first set of figures comes from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, an independent institute dedicated to research into conflict, armaments, arms control and disarmament. The institute maintains an online database of military expenditures since 1988 for 172 countries. In 2011 -- the most recent year available -- the United States led the world in military spending at $711 billion, marking 41 percent of the world total, according to the institute. The next top 12 spending nations accounted for a combined total of $670.9 billion, according to the institute. U.S. expenditures were nearly five times higher than China, the second-highest nation with an estimated $143 billion in military spending. Russia was in third place with estimated spending of $71.9 billion. We found similar results when we reviewed the data released by The International Institute for Strategic Studies, a London-based think tank which tracks military spending in 170 countries for its annual "Military Balance" report. According to IISS figures released last year, the United States’ defense budget in 2011 was $739.3 billion, making it the largest in the world. The combined total of the next top 9 nations was $486.7 billion, according to IISS figures. Referring to U.S. military spending, Michael O’Hanlon, a defense expert with the nonpartisan Brookings Institution, explained in an e-mail: "It is large because we have overseas interests all over the world, and we put a high premium on responsiveness and qualitative superiority." But the United States is poised to restrain its defense expenditures in the coming years. In addition to reduced costs from winding down the war in Afghanistan, the Budget Control Act of 2011 contains provisions that limit spending increases in defense and other areas over the next decade. It’s worth noting that calculating military expenditures for worldwide comparisons is inherently challenging, in part because there is no single definition of what constitutes military spending. As the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute points out on its website, "the lack of sufficiently detailed data makes it difficult to apply a common definition of military expenditure on a worldwide basis." Our ruling In a panel discussion on HBO’s "Real Time with Bill Maher," Booker claimed that "right now, we have more military spending than the next 10, 11, 12 countries combined." The mayor’s statement is accurate, according to data from two leading authorities on worldwide military spending. One set of figures shows that, in 2011, military spending by the United States exceeded the combined total of the next 12 highest nations by roughly $40 billion. We rate the statement True.

pomt-00053	Says Texas U.S. Rep. John Culberson "was caught using campaign cash on collectibles, including Civil War memorabilia and fossils."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/nov/03/environmental-defense-fund-action/did-texas-us-rep-john-culberson-use-campaign-money/	As the 2018 campaign comes to a close, the political arm of the Environmental Defense Fund has sent a mailer to homes in Texas’ 7th Congressional District saying that John Culberson, a Republican congressman, is "wrong for Houston." As partial proof, it said he was "caught using campaign cash on collectibles, including Civil War memorabilia and fossils." "Caught" is an interesting word, since the nine-term incumbent, now challenged by Democrat Lizzie Pannill Fletcher, disclosed the memorabilia purchases, which he says he gave as gifts from his campaign. As for the fossils, his campaign insisted there were no such purchases -- and said it only bought books and maps from a business that happens to also sell fossils. Critics have made a false assumption, the Culberson campaign told us initially. We’ll look at both parts of the claim but will give away a bit of what we found right here: He bought fossil replicas. If you wonder why an environment group would care about fossils and Culberson, the group noted that Culberson said in late summer that his purchases were for research into such things as paleoclimatology, or the study of climates before instrumental records were widely available, to help him better understand climate change. Environmental Defense Fund Action says that for all this studying, Culberson still refuses to accept scientific research on the matter. Culberson has said humans played a role in climate change but, as he told the Los Angeles Times in 2015, "We just don’t have enough data or accurate data to say with certainty what that effect has been." Fossils Let’s take fossils first. The congressman’s critics based their claim on a mention in a 2012 campaign finance report that Culberson’s campaign made two purchases from a South Dakota organization, the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research. The institute sells fossils, replicas and other things, and Culberson spent $309.66 altogether there, Federal Election Commission records show. The purchase was part of a broader set of Culberson expenses being questioned by Texas Democrats -- a set of questions we are not addressing fully here because we are looking specifically at campaign ads and claims. But for a bit of perspective, the Houston Chronicle wrote in August that Texas Democrats were challenging nearly $50,000 in Culberson campaign spending since 2004. Focusing just on fossils, PolitiFact asked Culberson’s campaign what it bought from the Black Hills Institute. We were told it bought books and maps, not fossils, the same explanation the campaign has given since August. "Only in politics does a person get attacked for trying to be better at their job," Culberson campaign spokeswoman Catherine Kelly said. "The mailer from the Environmental Defense Action Fund is factually wrong. The congressman never bought fossils with campaign contributions and all other purchases are acceptable under House and FEC rules." Culberson is a voracious reader, and has spent thousands of dollars from his campaign account for books and materials, including some on paleoclimatology, that his campaign says were related to his job. In just the 2011-12 campaign season, Culbserson’s campaign spent $9,848 on "research" or "research materials," most of it from vendors such as Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble, FEC records reviewed by PolitiFact show. Culberson chairs the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees spending on science and such agencies as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The research material helps him better understand the changing levels of carbon dioxide in the climate, his campaign says. Asked about records that would show he was buying books and maps, not fossils, from the Black Hills Institute, his campaign said the 2012 records for such specific purchases no longer exist. We’ve got the receipts PolitFact, however, called the Black Hills Institute. They pulled the invoices from Culberson's two separate orders and sent us copies. This is what the campaign paid for, excluding shipping charges: Three large wall charts showing extensive histories of the Earth and matter, dating back 4.5 billion years. The charts have columns showing tectonic maps, changes in the earth such as mountain formation, major volcanic eruptions, glacial epochs, craters from asteroids and comets and extensive information on fossils, invertebrates and vertebrate lifeforms, as well as their extinction. These cost $19.95 apiece. One desktop model of a Triceratops. It cost $84.05. Two lage -- 4.5 inches -- fossil replicas of a Tyrannosaurus Rex tooth. Each cost $40. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The FEC gives "pretty wide latitude" to the purchase of books and other materials that a candidate or officeholder might use in his or her official capacity, Brendan Fischer, an expert on campaign finance law at the Campaign Legal Center, told us. But what about a Triceratops model and replicas of a Tyrannosaurus Rex tooth fossil? "I’d like to hear their explanation for it," he said. "It’s hard to see how it would pertain to their official duties." We told the campaign what we found, and it asked what our proof was. So we sent the campaign the invoices for the congressman’s purchases. The response from Kelly, the spokeswoman: "The invoices confirm that the congressman never bought actual fossils, and every purchase from the Black Hills Institute is considered acceptable under House and FEC rules." Asked why the congressman bought the replicas and the model at all, Kelly said, "While these purchases were more than six years ago and now being used as part of a coordinated partisan hit job, the congressman believes these particular purchases were gifts, which is completely acceptable under FEC and House rules." Collectibles The mailer from Environmental Defense Fund Action also mentioned Culberson’s use of campaign money to buy collectibles and Civil War memorabilia. This, too, originated from the Democrats’ complaint referenced in the Houston Chronicle. Culberson is a Civil War history buff, collector and sometime-seller of memorabilia. But when it comes to his campaign funds, the purchases were for items such as stamps and coins the congressman got in order to give out as gifts, his campaign said. Congress members frequently use campaign money to buy gifts for constituents and volunteers, and the Culberson campaign said the Texas Republican was doing nothing different from what House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi has done when buying white orchids. The FEC allows candidates and officeholders to buy and give as gifts items of nominal value as long as they are not given to family members, Fischer said. FEC reports show only what a candidate or officeholder pays, not the value of the each item. For example, in 2014, Culberson’s campaign spent $3,631 on coins from an antique coin seller. In 2009 and 2010, the campaign spent $4,181 on antiques and coins for gifts, including hat stars (an emblem worn on soldiers’ hats) and Texas Centennial and Republic of Texas coins, FEC records show. Culberson’s campaign said the value of each coin was about $25, and the value of stamps was about $10. For a broader view, we downloaded FEC data showing all federal candidate purchases -- those for everyone with a federal campaign account -- of items listed as "gifts" just since January 2017. The total reached $1.8 million, for everything from model airplanes to a quilt to gift baskets. Our ruling Environmental Defense Fund Action said Texas U.S. Rep. John Culberson "was caught using campaign cash on collectibles, including Civil War memorabilia and fossils." "Caught" seemed strong to us at first, given the campaign’s denials. But with a phone call and email, it turned out that Culberson had in fact used campaign funds -- not for fossils, but for replicas and a desktop model. Our ruling comes down to perspective. The mailer’s spin seemed a little strong at first, especially knowing that gift purchases, whether for Civil War trinkets or not, are allowable if considered of nominal value. But the insistence of the campaign that Culberson did not buy fossils -- and that he had only bought books and maps -- is a factor as well. OK, he didn’t buy fossils. He bought fossil replicas. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-06641	"The majority last quarter of Sherrod Brown's campaign contributions came from outside of the state of Ohio."	false	/ohio/statements/2011/sep/15/josh-mandel/josh-mandel-chides-sen-sherrod-brown-out-state-con/	If you’re looking for fun with numbers (and who isn’t?), you could do a lot worse than download campaign finance data from the Federal Election Commission and sort it on a spreadsheet. But you won’t have to. Josh Mandel’s campaign has done it for you. We’ve done it too, and can confirm that the Republican U.S. Senate candidate’s staff knows its stuff. It also knows that Mandel got something wrong. During an interview with WKYC in Cleveland on Sept. 1, Mandel was asked about some campaign contributions that have raised some eyebrows. The generous contributions were from employees of a Canton direct mail firm, Suarez Corporation. Bloggers, the Ohio Democratic Party and news reporters have asked how those employees could afford to write such campaign checks. There has been no proof that someone else actually provided the money, which would be illegal. But the unusual appearance has led reporters to ask questions.. Thus, the question to Mandel by WKYC reporter Tom Beres: What do you say to people who are disturbed by these contributions? Mandel, who is currently Ohio’s treasurer, sidestepped the question, responding with a swipe at Sen. Sherrod Brown, the Democratic incumbent he hopes to defeat in 2012. "Well, the majority last quarter of Sherrod Brown's campaign contributions came from outside of the state of Ohio," he said. "The majority of ours, came from inside of the state of Ohio." That provoked a new question: Really? There’s nothing improper about going out of state to raise campaign cash, unless an office holder is neglecting his duties. But while sidestepping the question, Mandel indirectly opened a new line of criticism: that Brown doesn’t have the faith of Ohio voters and contributors. The Mandel campaign says it intends to continue that line, saying it believes it is true. But Mandel was wrong in his statement. His spokesman, Joe Aquilino, shot us an e-mail while we were still sorting the data, saying, "Josh misspoke and meant to say that the majority this year of Sherrod Brown's campaign contributions have come from outside the state of Ohio. ("last quarter" vs "this year"). We'll keep using this talking point and it's actually much worse than what Josh said during the interview. We'll be using this statistic a lot to show Senator Brown's lack of support from people here in Ohio who actually know him and know his record." This brings us to the numbers. We downloaded data from CQMoneyLine, a subscription service that sorts FEC data, and then turned to the original FEC records to do more crunching, factoring in itemized contributions (those of more than $200, which by law must list the donor’s name and address) and donations from political action committees. The Mandel campaign sent us its numbers, too, and they too came from an FEC download. The numbers matched. They show that Mandel was wrong about the most recent quarter, which ended June 30. Brown got the majority of his contributions from Ohioans: $623,049 in state, compared with $609,506 out of state. The previous quarter, however, more money came to Brown from out of state. Putting the two quarters together, the totals tipped the balance to the out-of-state side: $1,098,899 from Ohio, compared with $1,225,202 from out of state. Does that make Mandel wrong in a narrow sense -- but right in a broader way? His campaign sees it that way. Yet data that includes Brown’s current term but also goes back to his days in the House of Representatives, crunched on a regular basis by the Center for Responsive Politics for every member of Congress, shows that a majority of Brown’s donations have always been from Ohio. That could change in the future, as it could for Mandel, who has only raised money during a single quarter so far in this race (and the majority of his donations were from Ohio). Both candidates must raise millions more. Both will look for deep pockets throughout the United States. But Mandel was wrong on his specific claim. And if adding in one more quarter renders him sort-of right, a long history involving years of Brown elections renders Mandel wrong. On the Truth-O-Meter, Mandel’s statement is simply False.

pomt-07998	TriMet is "spending 4.2 million in fed funds to save $168K per year."	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2011/jan/15/lars-larson/larson-accuses-trimet-investing-too-much-prospecti/	Federal cash giveaways always get close attention from pundits and politicians -- and PolitiFact Oregon. More often than not, the funds that go toward research in the form of scientific and technological grants (and particularly odd-sounding grants) usually get labeled as wasteful spending. (Does anybody remember the great ant debate?) Well, we’re on the case of another wasteful-spending accusation; this time radio personality Lars Larson is accusing TriMet of a particularly poor investment choice. On Dec. 21, 2010, he sent out a mighty tweet proclaiming: "(T)he brain trust at Tri Met just announced they are spending 4.2 million in fed funds to save $168K per year." To add a little insult to injury he also asked a question: "(C)an anyone down there do math?" By our calculation, anyway, an investment of $4.2 million being paid back at $168,000 a year wouldn’t be cleared for some 25 years. That’s a ways off, to be sure, so we figured it was worth looking into whether TriMet was investing wisely "in these hard economic times." First off, we needed a little context. What, exactly was this $4.2 million going to fund? We gave TriMet a call and Bekki Witt, the agency’s spokeswoman, e-mailed us a release. Here’s how it starts out and where Larson gets his $4.2 million figure: "TriMet has received a $4.2 million grant from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to expand the use of regenerative braking on MAX trains. The grant will allow TriMet to install 20 energy storage units on light rail vehicles, capturing much of the energy generated by the trains’ braking systems and storing that energy for immediate and future use." Sounds good. Now how about that $168,000 annual savings? Just read a little further: "The new units will release the stored energy to help power those trains as well as other trains on the system. The storage units, or energy capacitors, will capture and use nearly 100 percent of the power generated by braking trains, saving $168,000 a year in energy costs." Based on those two paragraphs, it seems Larson is on to something. TriMet is spending more than $4 million to upgrade its regenerative braking systems so that they can store the saved energy. That energy adds up to a savings of about $168,000 annually. But, as with most research, sometimes dollars are just the beginning when it comes to the returns. So, we gave Witt a call and asked her what she thought about Larson’s comments. The figures sound, right, we said. What gives? First, she said, it’s important to understand the scope of the grant program from which TriMet received the funds. According to the FTA website, the program was created when "The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the federal stimulus) provided $100 million to be distributed as discretionary grants to public transit agencies for capital investments that will assist in reducing the energy consumption or greenhouse gas emissions of public transportation systems." Witt elaborated: "TriMet is the first in the country to try this technology out. … We're kind of part of that research and development aspect of it." As it stands now, TriMet does recoup some of the energy the trains create while braking, but that energy must be used almost immediately, either by the train itself or by a nearby train (the rescued energy can be transferred short distances). With this new technology, that saved energy can be stored and used for broader purposes, she said. "It gives us that flexibility that we don't have right now," Witt said. "This is something we see as a valuable project that will pay off in the long term. it's kind of a pilot, if you will, to see how it might work for us and for other transit programs throughout the country." When we contacted the Federal Transit Administration, the director and an engineer there echoed Witt’s remarks. "In time, we’re confident this regenerative braking will reduce transportation costs significantly around the country — while also reducing our dependence on oil," wrote administrator Peter Rogoff in an e-mail comment. We wondered if any of this might convince Larson that the trade-off was not as stark as he initially believed. No, he said, it didn’t. TriMet’s press release was clear, $4.2 million to save $168,000 a year. "You don’t know what the value of research will be," Larson said. It’s clear then, that there are two competing views here. Larson is looking at this grant in the Portland vacuum. TriMet and the Federal Transit Administration are looking at it in a broader, national context: TriMet is spending $4.2 million to refine technology that might, eventually, offer a significant return. So what about the ruling? Well, it would be premature to offer up a figure for the return on research, just as Larson argued. That said, he certainly simplified the grant and the expenditure. To say it’s a simply case of spending ‘x’ to save ‘y’ seems somewhat disingenuous. As with most political statements, this one needs some context. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-04228	Says because of Hurricane Sandy in Atlantic City "much of that boardwalk no longer exists -- just the pillars where the boardwalk used to be."	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/nov/25/frank-lautenberg/frank-lautenberg-says-after-hurricane-sandy-much-b/	Hurricane Sandy washed iconic Jersey Shore landmarks into the sea, but despite what you may have heard -- from social media, television or maybe even a United States senator -- the historic boardwalk fronting Atlantic City’s casinos survived. Two weeks after the monstrous storm swept through New Jersey, devastating large swaths of the state’s coastline, Frank Lautenberg, a Democrat, took to the Senate floor to describe the destruction and push for funding for recovery efforts. In his Nov. 13 speech, the senator mentioned damage across the state, but said, "the seashore community was hit especially hard." "The boardwalk is the defining image of the New Jersey shore. Many of us remember walking on that boardwalk in wonderment of the attractions. The boardwalk has been a constant in the lives of those who live there or visit the shore. But for communities like Belmar, Seaside Heights, the Atlantic City, and others, much of that boardwalk no longer exists -- just the pillars where the boardwalk used to be, as we see it here," Lautenberg said as he showed a photograph of damage to a section of boardwalk in Atlantic City. "It was a magnificent boardwalk and had people in cars that were -- in wagons that were pushed along, and you would view the sea and the attractions on the other side. And it was painful to see the destruction of the part of the boardwalk in Atlantic City firsthand that day." Lautenberg’s spokesman, Caley Gray, pointed out the senator did reference "part" of the boardwalk in his speech, but the senator omitted a critical detail: the section of boardwalk in Atlantic City that the storm washed away was in disrepair and much of it had been scheduled for demolition. The main promenade that runs in front of the city’s casinos remains intact and open for business. "It is factually accurate that a portion of the boardwalk was destroyed by Sandy," said Jeff Guaracino, chief communications and strategy officer for Atlantic City Alliance, but "it’s not the boardwalk that the average person would typically associate with a visit to Atlantic City." Atlantic City Alliance, a nonprofit group focused on increasing tourism, has launched a campaign to dispel the rumor that the city’s famed boardwalk was destroyed. Guaracino said some media outlets, particularly television stations, cut from stock images of the oceanfront boardwalk to the destruction of the dilapidated promenade, leaving viewers with the impression the commercial section of the boardwalk had washed away. But the walkway destroyed by Sandy stood in a primarily residential neighborhood near the Absecon Inlet. That area of the boardwalk had been deteriorating for decades. Portions of it had collapsed well before the storm and were closed to pedestrians. Now, Keith Mills, the city’s director of planning and development, said what remains are a "couple of ramps, couple of stairways, but at this point they are ramps and stairways to nothing but a series of pilings in the water." But that’s not the case for the commercial stretch of the city’s boardwalk. Gray said in a statement that Lautenberg walked the boardwalk after the storm and surveyed the damage in the inlet section. "The main drag in Atlantic City was fortunate to not have sustained more damage," he said, adding that Lautenberg is working to secure federal funding to fully restore the state’s coastline. Our ruling Lautenberg said that because of Hurricane Sandy in Atlantic City, "much of that boardwalk no longer exists—just the pillars where the boardwalk used to be." The storm washed away a dilapidated section of Atlantic City’s boardwalk -- much of which had been scheduled for demolition -- that runs along the Absecon Inlet. So there’s an element of truth to Lautenberg’s claim. But the stretch of the boardwalk in front of the casinos -- the area most tourists associate with Atlantic City -- fared the storm well. Lautenberg’s speech ignored those important details, so we rate this claim Mostly False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-01963	Says 11 soccer players on the U.S. Men’s National Team are immigrants.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/19/nancy-pelosi/are-there-immigrants-2014-us-mens-world-cup-team/	The United States is officially overcome with World Cup fever, and its inhabitants are showing support for the red, white and blue in many ways. Of course, for congressmen and women it means backing America with their thumbs by tweeting pro-U.S.A. rally cries to their followers and constituents. While the quadrennial event has generally united Democrats and Republicans, not all the social media cheering was free of politics. After the United States’ thrilling 2-1 victory on June 16, 2014, over Ghana, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi made an immigration reform push by invoking the U.S. Men’s National Team. She tweeted: "Immigrants help drive America's success, even in the World Cup! Look at what #USMNT would be without them. #TimeIsNow." By Thursday evening, it had been retweeted and favorited almost 1,000 times. The below picture was included: As you can see, the graphic shows 11 U.S. players with minuses next to their pictures and names. Pelosi’s tweet reads that those 11 players are immigrants who would likely not be on the roster if they weren’t allowed in the country. Much has been made about the number of United States players who have dual citizenships, but is the U.S. World Cup team powered by immigrants? We went through the roster and researched the backgrounds of the 11 players highlighted in the graphic. Six of the players were actually born in America. So even though they may have parents who are from other countries, they are very much considered citizens, not immigrants. Jozy Altidore: Born in Livingston, N.J., to two Haitian-born parents. Alejandro Bedoya: Born in Englewood, N.J., to two Colombian-born parents Julian Green: Born in Tampa, Fla., to an American serviceman father and a German mother; moved to Germany with his mother as a young child. Tim Howard: Born in New Brunswick, N.J., to an African-American father and his Hungarian mother. Aron Johannsson: Born in Mobile, Ala., to Icelandic parents. Omar Gonzalez: Born in Dallas, Texas, to Mexican parents. The other five were not born in the United States but have at least one parent who is an American. (In four of the cases, their fathers were in the United States military serving abroad.) That entitles them to all to U.S. citizenship, meaning they did not have to go through the immigration process noncitizens do. John Brooks: Born in Berlin, Germany, to an American serviceman father and a German mother. Timmy Chandler: Born in Frankfurt, Germany, to an American serviceman father and a German mother. Mix Diskerud: Born in Oslo, Norway, to a Norwegian father and an American mother. Fabian Johnson: Born in Munich, Germany, to an American serviceman father a German-born mother who had an American father. Jermaine Jones: Born in Frankfurt, Germany, to an American serviceman father and German mother. So not only are none of these 11 individuals considered immigrants by the United States, they're all actually natural born citizens. Pelosi’s office told us the source of the graphic is a story posted on Business Insider from Global Post. The story noted that a number of far-right nationalist parties with anti-foreigner sentiments seem to be on the rise in Europe. Some countries are also considering anti-immigration legislation that would put stricter quotas on new inhabitants. Therefore, the author wanted to imagine what these teams would look like without immigrants. To do this, he singled out players with at least one foreign-born parent. As Vox’s Dara Lind points out, "That might make sense for other countries, where parentage is more important to citizenship. But it doesn't make any sense for the U.S., where nearly everyone has some sort of immigrant heritage, and where everyone born on U.S. soil is a citizen from birth." Basically, in some countries, it doesn’t matter if you were born there; citizenship is more closely tied to lineage. That’s not the case in America, one of a small number of countries that grants citizenship at birth. We took all of this to Pelosi’s office. Spokesman Drew Hammill said they weren’t claiming these players were immigrants, rather, "We’re merely echoing the point made by the creators of the graphic about the contributions of these sons of immigrants." But not even all of the foreign-born parents are actually immigrants. Timmy Chandler, for example, stayed in Germany with his German mother after he was born. So by no definition is the United States represented by immigrants at the World Cup in Brazil. That’s not to say immigrants or immigration aren’t important to the makeup and heritage of the team. The United States is a country built on immigrants, and every player on the team can trace back at least half their lineage to another country (there is one half Native American on the team, forward Chris Wondolowski). But that’s not the message Pelosi was trying to give with her tweet. If it was, you could have whited out the entire team. Our ruling In a tweet pushing immigration reform, Pelosi posted a picture of the U.S. Men’s National Team missing 11 of its players and tweeted "Immigrants help drive America's success, even in the World Cup! Look at what #USMNT would be without them." In this instance "them" means immigrants. But none of those 11 players are immigrants. Some aren’t even the children of immigrants. We rate the statement False.	None	Nancy Pelosi	None	None	None	2014-06-19T18:25:20	2014-06-17	['None']
pomt-14788	The Milwaukee County executive can sell the public "museum, the airport and the zoo" -- all on his own, without County Board approval	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/dec/03/chris-larson/can-milwaukee-county-executive-sell-airport-zoo-an/	The two Milwaukee Democrats sparring in the race for Milwaukee County executive are both busy talking about the incumbent, Chris Abele. The millionaire philanthropist, elected in 2011 to succeed Scott Walker, is touting his accomplishments -- claiming he balanced the county budget "without raising taxes five years in a row" (Half True), and that 1 million route-miles have been added to the bus system without a fare increase (Mostly True). Meanwhile, the leading challenger, state Sen. Chris Larson, has cast Abele as out of touch -- and too powerful. Larson, who was a member of the county Board of Supervisors before Abele took office, won election to the Senate in 2010 after defeating a Democratic incumbent. On the Nov. 22, 2015 "Upfront with Mike Gousha" public affairs TV show, Larson decried the power Abele he has gained at the expense of the County Board, which is essentially moving to part-time status as a result of a 2014 voter referendum. With the referendum, which Abele supported, salaries for the 18 County Board supervisors will be cut in half following the April 2016 elections. In addition, the supervisors’ health insurance will end and no additional pension benefits will be accrued. Gousha asked Larson whether a full-time County Board is better than a part-time board. Larson answered by making a claim we want to check, as well as a reference to rapper-producer Kanye West. "I do understand that there’s a lot of people who don’t like the County Board. I’d also understand that there’s people who don’t like Congress," Larson said. "The difference I have is that I don’t think we should abolish Congress, or abolish the legislative check and balance that we have in American-style democracy." Then Larson alluded to a recent change in state law that gives more power to the Milwaukee County executive, saying: "If anything, I think we've erred too far in giving all this power to one individual, including land sales. He has unilateral authority over the County Board -- or, the County Board has no oversight over land sales, including the museum, the airport and the zoo. That's just scary to think what he could do with that. And to paraphrase Kanye West: No one man should have all that power." So -- not that it's likely -- but does the Milwaukee County executive have the power, on his own, to sell the Milwaukee Public Museum, General Mitchell International Airport and the Milwaukee County Zoo. All without approval from the County Board? The law In July 2015, while making final adjustments to the 2015-’17 state budget, GOP lawmakers inserted a provision to eliminate the Milwaukee County Board’s oversight of sales of county-owned properties that are not zoned for park use. County Board members made power-grab allegations against Abele who, despite being a Democrat, has forged alliances with some Republicans. The budget provision helped clear the way for Abele to sell 10 acres of land that is envisioned as part of a downtown Milwaukee development coinciding with a new arena for the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team. Now to Larson’s claim. Under the change in state law, any sale of non-park land owned by Milwaukee County requires the approval of only one other person besides the county executive -- either the elected county comptroller or a real estate expert who lives in the community where the land is located and who does not hold public office. That expert is appointed by the Milwaukee County Intergovernmental Cooperation Council, which is made up of elected representatives from the various cities and villages in the county. In other words, the County Board doesn’t have a say, although the county executive alone couldn’t sell non-park land, such as the museum, the airport or the zoo. The county’s top attorney, Corporation Counsel Paul Bargren, confirmed in a memo to the County Board that county-owned land that isn’t zoned for parks can be sold without the board’s OK. "Specifically, the executive could lease, sell or convey any non-park county property regardless of board policy and without board approval," he wrote. Either the comptroller or the appointed real estate expert would have to determine that the sale "is in the best interests of the county." Bargren noted that counties are considered an arm of the state. And that the state Legislature can delegate or remove powers from county boards in all 72 counties and can, as it did in this case, treat one county differently than the others. "In effect, the Legislature has inserted itself in place of the (Milwaukee) County Board and, as a matter of county policy, has delegated administration of land sales and contracts and procurement to the executive," his memo says. Our rating Larson said the Milwaukee County executive can sell the public "museum, the airport and the zoo" -- all on his own, without County Board approval. A recent change in state law that applies only to Milwaukee County allows the executive to sell any county-owned land not zoned as park land without approval of the County Board. However, such sales would need the OK of at least one other person -- either the elected county comptroller or a real estate expert appointed by elected municipal officials who lives in the community where the land is located. We rate Larson’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-13758	"Nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/22/donald-trump/trump-nearly-180000-illegal-immigrants-have-crimin/	Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump told the American public that beginning Jan. 20, 2017, safety will be restored. That means putting an end to violence and crime afflicting the nation, he said. There are immigrants in the country illegally who are out endangering communities, Trump added. "Nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens," Trump said in his nomination acceptance speech Thursday. We looked into that number to find out if that many convicted immigrants with deportations are out on the streets. Trump’s campaign said his statement came from a June 2016 report from the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that favors more strict immigration policies. The Center for Immigration Studies, in turn, relied on data obtained by the Senate Judiciary Committee. According to CIS, there were more than 925,000 immigrants who had been ordered removed but were still in the country as of July 2015. And an estimated 20 percent of them had at least one criminal conviction — nearly all of whom were at large. So Trump’s numbers are correct. But experts say there is some important context. Ana Gonzalez-Barrera, a senior researcher at Pew Research Center, said the figure includes immigrants from countries that won’t accept them back. "In these cases, the immigrants have to be released after they have completed their sentences," Gonzalez-Barrera said. And in yet other instances, state and local jurisdictions have passed policies limiting cooperation with immigration authorities so they don’t notify them when a deportable noncitizen has completed a jail term or prison sentence, said Michelle Mittelstadt, communications director of the Migration Policy Institute. Jennifer Elzea, spokeswoman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, says ICE makes custody determinations on a case-by-case basis, "considering all the merits and factors of each case while adhering to current agency priorities, guidelines and legal mandates." "Those who are not subject to mandatory detention and do not pose a threat to the community may be placed on some form of supervision as an alternative to detention while awaiting their immigration court hearing," Elzea said. Still, Center for Immigration Studies points to a February 2016 ICE report showing that from fiscal year 2010 through July 21, 2015, 124 criminal immigrants released from ICE custody were subsequently charged with homicide-related crimes. Our ruling Trump said "nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens." According to federal data, 925,000 immigrants had been ordered removed but were still in the country as of July 2015. And an estimated 20 percent of them had at least one criminal conviction — nearly all of whom were at large. However, immigration officials say they make custody determinations on case-by-case basis and those who do not pose a threat to the community may be placed on some form of supervision as an alternative. Trump’s statement is accurate, but needs additional information, we rate it Mostly True. Update: We've added information from ICE saying they make custody determinations on a case-by-case basis. We also added a report showing that from fiscal year 2010 through July 21, 2015, 124 criminal immigrants released from ICE custody were subsequently charged with homicide-related crimes. Correction: A previous version of this post incorrectly said people seeking asylum and who do not appear before immigration judges are considered deported for criminal behavior. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/aa2fc627-324a-45ec-be8b-7632680d76c6	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-07-22T02:36:58	2016-07-21	['None']
pomt-12176	"Corporations have NEVER made as much money as they are making now."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/aug/01/donald-trump/have-corporations-never-made-much-money-now-donald/	In what has become a regular occurrence, Donald Trump took to Twitter to tout the nation’s economic performance on his watch. In a tweet on the morning of Aug. 1, 2017, Trump praised some of the commentary about the Trump-era economy on Fox & Friends: " ‘Corporations have NEVER made as much money as they are making now.’ Thank you Stuart Varney @foxandfriends Jobs are starting to roar,watch!" See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com We thought the remark about corporate profits was worth a closer look. The White House did not respond to an inquiry. Are corporate profits higher now than ever? The details of this are a bit complicated given the fact that Trump is implying he deserves some credit. That’s because the most recent data is from January 2017, which predates Trump taking office. In January 2017, corporate profits totaled $1.81 trillion on an annualized basis, according to the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis. That’s the highest in history in raw dollars. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com But the high profits Trump is touting came during President Barack Obama’s tenure. And as we always point out in these cases, this is not due solely to Trump (or Obama). For better or for worse, presidents have a modest impact on the economy. Cyclical factors, the international economy, demographics and technology all play important roles, and they tend to be beyond the control of any president. Second, experts say measuring raw dollars is not as illustrative as analyzing corporate profits as a percentage of overall gross domestic product. That analysis, it turns out, paints Trump’s claim in a less impressive light. Corporate profits as a share of gross domestic product As the chart below shows, the January 2017 data point, while impressive, is far from unprecedented. That’s due in large part to the reality that the economy tends to grow over time, with corporate profits not necessarily outpacing the overall growth level. The current level of corporate profits as a share of GDP was exceeded once during Harry Truman’s presidency, five times under President George W. Bush, and a 14 times under President Barack Obama. In fact, that’s almost half of the quarters during Obama’s tenure (44 percent). See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com How important are corporate profits as an economic indicator? Now let’s take a step back. What do these numbers actually mean? Economists say that measuring corporate profits is useful -- up to a point. On the one hand, "prosperity is ordinarily good news for both business owners and workers," said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. "It is certainly fair to cite high business profits as an indicator the economy is doing well." However, Burtless added that when corporate profits are historically high, they might be crowding out wage or salary increases for workers, which ends up curbing how widely the prosperity spreads through the rest of the economy. Economists offer divergent views on how stark this tradeoff is. Dan Mitchell, a scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute, agreed that "capital and labor compete for shares of income in the short run." Over the long term, however, "there is no tradeoff between corporate profits and labor income," he said. But Dean Baker, an economist with the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, countered that "high corporate profits are good for people who own lots of stock -- that’s about it." In fact, Baker said, the historical record suggests that high levels of investment -- in people and otherwise -- doesn’t necessarily move in tandem with high profits. Either way, one conclusion does seem clear: The share of the economy devoted to wages has been decreasing over the long term. Here’s a chart showing employee compensation as a share of gross domestic product since the end of World War II. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Trump tweeted that "corporations have NEVER made as much money as they are making now." In raw dollars, corporations are making more money as of January 2017 than ever before. It’s worth noting that the data isn’t in for a Trump-only quarter. And as a share of the broader economy, corporate profit levels are not unprecedentedly high -- in fact, for almost half of the quarters under Obama, the share was even higher.

pomt-12991	"Taxes for every New Yorker are lower today than when I started"	half-true	/new-york/statements/2016/dec/16/andrew-cuomo/most-taxes-are-lower-cuomo-was-elected/	Andrew M. Cuomo targeted high taxes when he announced his candidacy for New York governor. "We’re tired of seeing New Yorkers leave the state because they can’t pay their taxes anymore," Cuomo said at his May 2010 announcement. Now, more than halfway into his second term, Cuomo says he’s kept his promise to lower taxes. "I’ve spent less than every other governor and when you spend less you can cut taxes. Taxes for every New Yorker are lower today than when I started," Cuomo said during a recent speech in Fishkill. "Corporate taxes are down to the level they were at in 1968. Middle-class taxes are down to the level they were at in 1947. Manufacturing taxes are down to the level they were at in 1917." Is Cuomo right? Are taxes for every New Yorker lower? Personal income taxes Income taxes are lower for earners at all wage levels compared with 2010, according to the state Department of Budget. From the highest-income residents to couples earning less than about $40,000 annually, tax rates are lower, though not dramatically for the highest earners. A married couple making more than roughly $2.1 million is taxed at an 8.82 percent rate, down from 8.97 percent. In 2010, married couples making $500,000 were taxed at 8.97 percent. Now, married couples making between roughly $320,000 and $2.1 million are taxed at 6.85 percent. For couples earning less than about $40,000 annually, the tax rate has stayed the same since 2010, ranging from 5.9 percent to 4 percent for the lowest earners. The Department of Budget says deductions have increased for those earners despite the flat rate. Deductions have been indexed to inflation since Cuomo and the legislature passed new tax law in 2011. That means deductions should be larger for anyone in this wage category who earns the same amount in 2015 as in 2011. The same is true for single filers. The tax rate has decreased for anyone making more than about $20,000 annually. The rate has stayed the same for anyone making less than that, though deductions are indexed to inflation for these filers as well. Business income taxes Manufacturers were taxed on income at a rate of 5.9 percent in 2010. That same tax has now been reduced to 0 percent according to the Department of Budget. Manufacturers also receive a 20 percent real property tax credit if they own or lease property. Corporate taxes are also lower. In 2010, the corporate net income tax was 7.1 percent. Now, it’s 6.5 percent. Property taxes Property taxes statewide continue to rise despite a state imposed cap. Most municipalities are not able to raise property taxes more than 2 percent without voter approval. The Department of Budget says the property tax bill for a typical taxpayer is more than the state income tax amount. A report from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy shows a resident's income level determines which tax hits the hardest. School taxes rose in the four years following the cap’s implementation in 2012, according to the Empire Center for Public Policy. School taxes are usually the largest part of a municipality’s property tax bill. The level of state aid to schools affects how much districts raise in property taxes. The rate at which these taxes increased is lower now than it was four years ago. Before the tax cap, the average property tax increase was 5.3 percent a year. The average increase was 2.2 percent in the first three years after the cap took effect, according to a report from the state. Sales tax The first 4 percentage points of sales taxes are levied by the state. Anything beyond that is levied by counties or cities. Increases in the local portion beyond 3 percent must be approved by the state Legislature and signed by the governor. The state portion of sales taxes has been unchanged since Cuomo took office. But the local portion has increased in seven counties, each time with state approval. The Essex County sales tax rate, for example, increased from 3.75 percent to 4 percent in 2013. Our ruling "Taxes for every New Yorker are lower today than when I started," Cuomo said during an event in Fishkill. If Cuomo had said income taxes for every New Yorker are now lower, he would have been right. It’s true that income taxes for individuals, corporations, and manufacturers are lower than when he took office in 2011. Although the Cuomo administration has slowed property tax growth through a state-imposed cap, property taxes continue to increase for residents. And the property tax takes a bigger bite than the income tax for many residents. Also, the state has also approved some sales tax increases at the county level since Cuomo took office. We rate this claim as Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2cd3f3ef-7aaf-49d3-983b-1d081b86368e	None	Andrew Cuomo	None	None	None	2016-12-16T16:10:45	2016-11-16	['The_New_Yorker']
pomt-04070	"Wind powers nearly 13 million homes across the country."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2013/jan/23/jennette-gayer/environmental-group-makes-powerful-claim-about-win/	While some complained about the fine print in the fiscal cliff deal, a local environmental activist was pleased with one portion of the bill and said something about it that seemed worthwhile to fact-check. Environment Georgia policy advocate Jennette Gayer sent out a news release thanking federal lawmakers for continuing key tax credits for wind power. "Wind powers nearly 13 million homes across the country and states like Texas, the number one wind energy producer in the country, generate a little over 30 million (megawatt hours per year)," Gayer wrote. PolitiFact Georgia wondered about Gayer’s claim that wind powers nearly 13 million homes in the United States. Is that true? Gayer pointed us to a couple of websites she used to back up her claim. PolitiFact Georgia was on its way down the windy road of wind energy. The development of wind energy, harvested by wind turbines, began in the 1970s. It’s grown in the decades since, but it is still a very small amount (3 percent) of the energy that’s produced in the United States, federal officials and researchers say. President Barack Obama talked energetically about wind power on the campaign trail last year, saying it’s creating jobs and it is an important alternative energy source. Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney had no plans to continue the tax credits. In 1992, the federal government began offering tax credits to individuals and companies for wind energy production as part of the Energy Policy Act. For every kilowatt hour of power from wind, the government gives the producer a tax credit worth 2.2 cents. At the time, the U.S. had 1.5 gigawatts of installed wind capacity. A gigawatt is the equivalent of 1 billion watts of electricity. A standard light bulb uses 100 watts. Most of the nation’s wind energy is produced in Texas, the Plains states and the West Coast, analysts say. Very little comes from the South. "It’s less windy in the Southeast, so there’s not a lot of technology to generate that energy," said Eric Lantz, a research analyst with the federal government’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Some organizations, such as the Institute for Energy Research, call the tax credits a "boondoggle." The institute, citing a study by the American Tradition Institute, says the costs of wind power is more expensive than other forms of energy generation, such as coal, natural gas and nuclear energy. By 1999, federal officials say they saw an increase in wind capacity. The American Wind Energy Association, a prominent group that supports the expanded use of wind energy, reported this past August that the U.S. had reached the 50-gigawatt milestone. The association’s estimate is, Lantz said, about a year ahead of the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Lantz said he reviewed the EIA’s most recent numbers and believes the association’s 50-gigawatt claim is on target. So how many homes can 50 gigawatts power? Lantz looked at U.S. census data and other information on the EIA website. He concluded about 12 million homes. "I think their number is reasonable," Lantz said of Gayer’s estimate. EIA spokesman Jonathan Cogan agreed. The federal agency estimated the nation was on pace to generate anywhere from 125 million to 140 million kilowatts of wind energy in 2012. The average American home uses about 11,000 kilowatts of energy a year, Cogan said. "It seems to check out," Cogan told us. We wondered, though, whether that meant 12 million or so homes in the U.S. were actually being powered through wind energy. Lantz said there is no data detailing the number of homes that actually use wind energy. Some of that energy could be powering commercial or other nonresidential facilities. It’s not possible to say for sure how many homes actually use wind-generated electricity. But it is clear that there is enough produced to power millions of homes. To sum up, Environment Georgia analyst Jennette Gayer said wind powers about 13 million homes across America. From the people we interviewed and research we’ve seen, this claim seems to have some juice. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Jennette Gayer	None	None	None	2013-01-23T06:00:00	2013-01-02	['None']
pomt-13633	"In Catherine Cortez Masto's last term as attorney general, Nevada murder went up 11 percent, robbery went up 28 percent, rape 51 percent. When Cortez Masto left office, Nevada ranked as America's third most dangerous state."	mostly false	/nevada/statements/2016/aug/10/national-republican-senatorial-committee/ad-blaming-cortez-masto-crime-upticks-ag-too-narro/	Democratic Senate candidate Catherine Cortez Masto is taking fire from a new ad claiming crime increased in Nevada under her watch as attorney general. A new National Republican Senatorial Committee television ad (in both English and Spanish) blames the former state attorney general for increases in crime during her time in office. "In Catherine Cortez Masto's last term as attorney general, Nevada murder went up 11 percent, robbery went up 28 percent, rape 51 percent," the ad says. "When Cortez Masto left office, Nevada ranked as America's third most dangerous state." The ad seeks to undercut part of Cortez Masto’s résumé that her Senate campaign relies on, invoking her tough-on-crime record in tv ads and referring to herself as the state’s former "top law enforcement officer." The numbers are technically accurate, but the ad fails to prove what Cortez Masto had to do with them. Crunching crime stats The claims about increased mayhem trace back to a 2014 report of state crime numbers over the last decade, which overlaps with Cortez Masto’s eight years in the Attorney General’s office. The ad correctly reflects the statewide percentage increases over Cortez Masto’s last term (2011 to 2014): Reported murders increased from 151 to 168 (11.2 percent) Reported robberies increased from 4635 to 5,951 (28.4 percent) Reported rapes increased from 895 to 1,351 (50.94 percent) Cortez Masto’s campaign said focusing on the back half of her tenure as attorney general was misleading, and that crime actually went down during her time in office. Total crime decreased from Cortez Masto’s first year in office (116,814) to her last (92,376), and most major reported crimes with the exception of rape decreased over that eight-year period. (A spreadsheet of the cited crime figure is here) Bill Sousa, director of UNLV’s Center for Crime and Justice Policy, cautioned that criminologists should take heed of any crime upticks. However, he said, year-to-year crime statistics can be unreliably "volatile." "In terms of a couple of decades, a few years looking up isn’t evidence of a general trend," he said. The increase in reported rape is concerning, but there may be another explanation — the FBI broadened its definition of rape in 2012 (read more about the revision here). The bureau’s Uniform Crime Report saw subsequent increases in reported rape both nationally and in Nevada. Reported accounts of rape in Nevada have increased since the change in definitions, which was previously defined as "carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will." Plus, these figures only count the total crimes committed and aren’t adjusted for the roughly 300,000 population increase during Cortez Masto’s term. UNLV sociology professor Dr. Andrew Spivak said rates of murder, robbery and the previous "legacy" definition of rape per 100,000 people decreased under Cortez Masto’s tenure in office. Generally, experts say, Nevada’s crime numbers likely trend higher because of the state’s heavy reliance on the tourism industry bringing large numbers of people, which isn’t reflected in the state’s population. "If you could somehow control for tourism population, I’d expect that Nevada would drop on that list," Sousa said. NRSC spokesman Greg Blair said in an email that the ad focused on Cortez Masto’s second term to highlight her apparent political ambition outweighing other duties. That’s a serious charge, and there’s no concrete proof she had anything to do with the decline in crime in her first term or the subsequent increase in her second. Crime was at an historical low in 2011, and it’s hard to say why. The crime report itself cautions police agencies against drawing any conclusions about a specific department given the variety of factors that can affect crime trends. "Because of other assigned duties, the peculiar cycle of crime and clearances, and different community factors that normally affect crime statistics, no conclusions regarding individual departments should be made without consulting directly with the agency being analyzed," the report states. Spivak was more blunt. "I cannot even begin to imagine how states' attorneys general have much influence over crime rates," he said in an email. "I suppose some might think that an AG who establishes a culture of harsh prosecution and various law enforcement initiatives will theoretically deter future crime ... but the kind of data to establish such a link is just impossible to generate." Sousa said state-level crime policy is important, but changes in the raw numbers are more reliant on policing in individual neighborhoods and precincts. "A lot of what we know about crime occurs at a local level," Sousa said. "It points to the idea that what state-level policies do can have influence, can have an impact, but the impact is minimal." Danger, danger (High voltage!) Similarly, there is some truth that Nevada took the third spot in a ranking of the 10 most dangerous states. Again, however, it’s not proven what Cortez Masto had to do with it, and the source is not as credible as the FBI. The NRSC cites a list published in January 2015 from 24/7 Wall Street, a website that covers financial news. The list indeed ranks Nevada third, but the data relies on both crime data and socioeconomic factors, such as the poverty rate and the percentage of adults with a high school diploma. No attorneys general, in Nevada or elsewhere, play much of a role in setting educational policy or promoting programs to get people out of poverty. Other rankings of dangerous states are somewhat of a mixed bag, mainly due to differing methodology. Another list by Law Street called Nevada the second most dangerous state, but that blog based the ranking on violent crimes per 100,000 people. Another ranking from WalletHub puts Nevada as ninth most dangerous of 51 states (including Washington, D.C.) but with a more involved methodology than other surveys. Spivak said reading into the rankings to determine which states were dangerous is "utterly absurd," given variances in methodology and no standardization or weighted use of crime or socioeconomic indicators. Our ruling The NRSC ad says Nevada was ranked as the third most dangerous state by the time Cortez Masto left office, and that "murder went up 11 percent, robbery went up 28 percent, rape 51 percent" during her second term. The NRSC cherry-picks a handful of short-term crime statistics to portray Cortez Masto as weak on crime enforcement. But the argument is flawed. Experts agree that crime statistics are a crude way to measure safety, and Nevada has several quirks that inflate the numbers. The ad claims that Cortez Masto "couldn’t keep us safe," but crime statistics have more to do with local law enforcement agencies than the state's attorney general. The NRSC offers no proven link connecting her actions as attorney general to a swing in murder, robbery and rape. The statement contains an element of truth but leaves out important details. We rate the statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/20da9352-14b7-46e8-a972-54a48b43a59c	None	National Republican Senatorial Committee	None	None	None	2016-08-10T11:46:10	2016-08-02	['United_States', 'Nevada']
pomt-09004	"Forty percent of the undocumented workers in this country" entered the U.S. legally and "overstayed their visa."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/12/luis-gutierrez/democratic-rep-gutierrez-says-40-percent-illegal-i/	On the July 11, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week, Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill. -- a champion of immigration legislation that includes a path to citizenship -- faced off with Rep. Brian Bilbray, R-Calif., a leading lawmaker who favors prioritizing immigration enforcement. At one point, Gutierrez said, "Here's the problem, and here's the fact that Mr. Bilbray leaves out of this debate. The fact is that 40 percent of the undocumented workers in this country didn't cross that border. They came here legally to the United States. They came on a tourist visa. They came on a student visa. They came on a temporary worker visa, and they overstayed their visa." We thought that statistic was worth a fact-check. Quantifying the number and nature of illegal immigrants is tricky -- precisely because they are evading law enforcement. But we located estimates made by the Pew Hispanic Center which the experts we interviewed consider credible. In a 2006 report, the center estimated that "nearly half of all the unauthorized migrants now living in the United States entered the country legally through a port of entry such as an airport or a border crossing point where they were subject to inspection by immigration officials." Specifically, the estimate ranged from 38 percent to 50 percent. The report split the difference by proposing a figure of 45 percent. So based on this measure, Gutierrez is accurate. In fact, he's being cautious, sticking to the low end of the spectrum. However, we'll offer two caveats. First, the data in this report, in addition to being an estimate, is several years old, so it's possible that the figures have changed. Second, the data for overstaying visas varies quite a bit between nationalities. The Pew report noted that only 16 percent of Mexican illegal immigrants who arrived prior to 1996 were in violation because they overstayed their visa. The comparable number for Central American immigrants was 27 percent, while the percentage for immigrants from the rest of the world was 91 percent. Granted, these statistics are even older than the ones cited above. However, the underlying reason for the disparity has not changed: Compared to other nationalities, it is still "easier for Mexicans to make illegal entries and harder for them to get visitor visas," as the report put it. A big reason, said Judith Gans, an immigration specialist at the University of Arizona, is that burden of proof is on visa-seekers to demonstrate to U.S. consular officials overseas that they won't be overstaying their visa, through such indicators as having a large family, a job and significant assets in their native country. As a result, she said, "Mexican middle-class people can get temporary visas such as tourist visas fairly easily. The same holds for middle-class Central and South Americans. Mexican poor people generally can’t obtain visas, nor can poor Central and South Americans." So one can argue that Gutierrez's decision to use the 40 percent figure in a televised discussion that focused on the U.S.-Mexico border is somewhat misleading, since viewers could be led to conclude -- incorrectly -- that 40 percent of Mexican or Latin American immigrants were simply overstaying their visa. But when we contacted Gutierrez's staff, they said that the distinctions across nationalities highlight exactly the point they were trying to make -- that politicians and the media are putting a disproportionate focus on U.S.-Mexico border crossings when in fact the illegal immigrant population, and the issues that follow, are much more diverse. "The opponents of immigration reform would like to keep the immigration issue focused on Latin America, the U.S.-Mexico border, and those who enter the U.S. without inspection, but that is only part of the story," said Gutierrez spokesman Douglas G. Rivlin. "The congressman's point when using this statistic was that the problem is bigger than the U.S.-Mexico border, bigger than Latin America, Latinos, or Arizona and therefore requires a more comprehensive, federal, national solution." In fact, Gutierrez made precisely that point on the show. Immediately after the quote we checked, he said, "So what we do is we continue to focus on the border as if that were the exclusive problem that we have with our immigration system and those staying here." Rivlin added that Gutierrez is sponsoring a bill (H.R. 4321) that would, among other things, establish an entry-and-exit system to track who enters on a temporary visa and whether they leave when they are supposed to. Reasonable people can disagree over whether Gutierrez is justified in arguing that the U.S.-Mexico border shouldn't be the focus of policymakers' attention on immigration. But the fact that he raised this issue when mentioning the visa-overstay statistics mitigates the potential for confusion. When that is weighed against the uncertainties over the age of the data and the need to use estimates rather than hard statistics, we rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-08144	In Wisconsin, "6.2 percent of the population is black yet 24 percent of all state abortions are on African-Americans."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2010/dec/06/pro-life-wisconsin/pro-life-wisconsin-says-african-americans-make-abo/	Using 13 billboards in Milwaukee, Pro-Life Wisconsin says it wants to raise awareness of what it calls the disproportionate abortion rate among African-American women in Wisconsin. According to the organization, which works to outlaw abortion, the billboards appeared Nov. 29, 2010, and will stay up for 30 days. They feature one of two messages: "Black children are in danger" or "Black & Beautiful." Each billboard shows a picture of an African-American infant and lists a website -- TooManyAborted.com/WI. That website, and an announcement about the billboards issued by Pro-Life Wisconsin, make the same claim: In Wisconsin, "6.2 percent of the population is black, yet 24 percent of all state abortions are on African-Americans." On the face of it, that seems like a large disparity. And it suggests race is a determining factor in abortion rates. We decided to take a look. Pro-Life Wisconsin’s claim is based on figures cited by the Georgia-based Radiance Foundation, which is co-sponsoring the Milwaukee billboards. The foundation accurately cites U.S. Census figures on the percentage of Wisconsin’s population that is African-American, and the state’s annual abortion report on the percentage of Wisconsin abortions that are performed on African-American women. But in doing so, it is setting up a false comparison. It compares the number of abortions obtained by black women to the entire black population. Obviously, only females in a certain age range can become pregnant. Nationally, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention looks at abortions by comparing the number each year per 1,000 women ages 15 to 44. The most recent CDC figures show the national rate abortion rate generally declined between 1997 and 2006. But the 2006 rate of 16.1 abortions per 1,000 women ages 15 to 44 was up 3.2 percent over the previous year. The abortion rate for black women, meanwhile -- 33.4 abortions per 1,000 black women ages 15 to 44 -- was more than twice the overall rate. Abortion rates for black women have been higher for years, "and have been attributed to high unintended pregnancy rates," according to the CDC. In making its claim, Pro-Life Wisconsin is suggesting that race is somehow the determining factor in people seeking an abortion. Experts say there are many other factors at play. Like the CDC, Jacquelyn Paykel, an OB/GYN at the Medical College of Wisconsin, points to the higher unintended pregnancy rate among black women. She said unintended pregnancies tend tend to occur among women with less education, lower socioeconomic status and less access to reproductive health care. And those factors are more likely to be present among black women, she said. So, the construction of the statement can lead to another false impression. Now, on to the Wisconsin figures, which are more current than the national ones. In Wisconsin, the estimated overall abortion rate for 2009 was seven abortions per 1,000 women ages 15 to 44 -- less than half of what national figures have shown. The rate was the same in 2008, according to the state’s annual abortion report. That report doesn’t provide statistics by race for the 15-to-44 age group. But we were able to make calculations, for 2009, using abortion and population statistics from the Wisconsin Department of Health Services: 88.3 percent of the women ages 15 to 44 in Wisconsin were white and white women accounted for 69 percent of the abortions performed in the state. 7.5 percent of the 15-to-44 women were African-Americans and African-Americans accounted for 24 percent of the abortions. Using this approach, which focuses on child-bearing years, the disparity among black women isn’t quite as large as what Pro-Life Wisconsin stated. We asked the group, which is based in the Milwaukee suburb of Brookfield, the purpose of the billboards. They are located mainly on Milwaukee’s north and northwest sides, the areas of the city where the largest numbers of African-Americans live. Spokeswoman Virginia Zignego said the organization wants to publicize the disparity in the abortion rate among black women and highlight abortion alternatives such as adoption. The website listed on the billboards, which is run by the Radiance Foundation, mentions adoption, but most of the material criticizes Planned Parenthood and other organizations. Zignego said the campaign also aims to show that Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin is racist because it locates many of its facilities -- some of which perform abortions -- in areas with the heaviest concentrations of African-Americans. Amanda Harrington, spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, said its services are geared toward pregnancy prevention -- and its sites are in areas where women need access to health care. Let’s return to the claim itself. The group accurately stated cited census and abortion numbers. But it used an approach that takes in the entire African-American population, not just women between age 15 and 44 -- the approach used by federal and Wisconsin authorities. By that measure, the actual disparity is smaller than what Pro-Life Wisconsin claimed. The group’s claim also leaves out important details -- namely, that socioeconomic factors, rather than race, have been identified as key contributors to the higher abortion rate among black women. We rate the statement Half True.	None	Pro-Life Wisconsin	None	None	None	2010-12-06T09:00:00	2010-11-29	['Wisconsin', 'African_American']
pomt-10802	"I don't think that Rudy or Fred or John McCain support the marriage amendment."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/05/mitt-romney/hes-right-that-others-have-hedged-/	In an interview on MSNBC, Romney tried to turn the tables on his Republican rivals -- who have accused him of flip-flopping on various issues -- by saying he was more consistent on gay marriage than they have been. He said, "I don't think that Rudy (Giuliani) or Fred (Thompson) or John McCain support the marriage amendment. And I think they're in error on that one." Indeed, Romney is the only Republican front-runner unequivocally backing a constitutional gay marriage ban. Giuliani, Thompson and McCain share his opposition to same-sex marriage but they vary in how they would address the issue at the federal level. Romney is the only Republican front-runner to support an amendment to the Constitution, such as the one that failed in Congress last year, which would limit marriage to male-female unions. McCain, who actively opposed the 2006 amendment attempt on the grounds that it was unnecessary and would violate states' rights, says that he would only support such an amendment if the Supreme Court began to strike down state-level gay marriage bans. Thompson has proposed a constitutional amendment that would not ban gay marriages, but would free states from the obligation to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states. That provision was included in the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, which Thompson and McCain both supported, but it is still being challenged in the courts. A constitutional amendment would preempt any judicial challenge to the existing law. A spokesman for Giuliani said the former mayor "does not support a federal marriage amendment at this time." Giuliani told CNN's Larry King in February 2007 that he would not support a constitutional amendment, "unless all of a sudden lots of states do what Massachusetts does and kind of come at it from the other side and decide that the Constitution says that -- that you cannot have marriage between a man and a woman. If it stays the way it is, you don't need one." We find Romney's statement on his opponents to be True because he is accurately describing their positions.

pomt-15375	Texas has "the nation's highest rate and highest number of uninsured."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2015/jul/01/donna-howard/donna-howard-says-texas-no-1-uninsured-residents-a/	An Austin legislator stressed the number of Texans who lack health coverage after applauding the U.S. Supreme Court for upholding federal subsidies under the Obamacare law. On a positive note, Democratic state Rep. Donna Howard said in a June 25, 2015, press release that the share of uninsured Texans has decreased thanks to more people buying insurance, some with help from the subsidies written into Affordable Care Act of 2010. Now, she said, the Republican-led state should act to draw more federal money to insure more residents—perhaps a reference to Texas’ refusal so far to expand Medicaid to more adults with the federal government initially picking up costs. Inaction, Howard said, "has only left Texas with the nation's highest rate and highest number of uninsured." Whatever the reasons, does Texas lead the nation in its uninsurance rate and its count of uninsured residents? That wasn’t so before. In 2013, we rated Mostly False a declaration by Rep. Garnet Coleman, D-Houston, that Texas had the nation’s most uninsured people, 6 million. As of 2011, then the latest year of survey data, Texas led the nation with its 24 percent share of uninsured residents. But more-populous California was home to about 1 million more uninsured residents. Also in 2013, we found True a claim that Texas had the most uninsured children. In 2012. According to federal survey results, Texas ranked first nationally with 1.1 million uninsured children, followed by California with 891,000. California is among states, unlike Texas, that expanded Medicaid access in accord with the Obamacare law. It stands to reason its uninsured population consequently shrunk. Another post-2013 factor: Key provisions of the Obamacare law—including the mandate that most Americans obtain coverage and the offer of subsidies for individuals to buy insurance—took effect in 2014, likely affecting who has a policy. Texas No. 1 in rate of uninsured Texas has evidently continued to rank No. 1 for its share of uninsured residents. To our inquiry, Scott Daigle, Howard’s chief of staff, noted by email a June 23, 2015, Austin American-Statesman story citing a national survey by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stating Texas had a higher percentage of uninsured adults in 2014 than any other state. Nearly 26 percent of Texas adults were uninsured, the story said, down from about 28 percent in 2013. We wondered about all residents of the states at issue. Separately, the Kaiser Family Foundation, drawing on U.S. Census Bureau survey results, keeps up with how many residents of each state have health coverage. Its latest charts indicate that per the bureau’s 2013 Current Population Survey, Texas and Nevada were tied for No. 1 that year with 20 percent of residents lacking coverage. At the time, according to the survey, 15 percent of California residents lacked coverage. In raw numbers, 5,769,600 Californians were uninsured, compared with 5,357,700 Texans, according to the survey. We also reached out to bureau spokesman Robert Bernstein who suggested by email we consider its American Community Survey results for 2013, the latest available, indicating 22 percent of Texans and 17 percent of Californians were uninsured that year. According to this survey, Nevada had the nation’s No. 2 uninsurance rate, nearly 21 percent. In raw numbers, the survey suggested, 6.5 million Californians lacked coverage compared to more than 5.7 million Texans. California vs. Texas in uninsured residents In question: Whether California kept its raw-total lead in uninsured residents through 2014. Doesn’t seem so, experts told us, because far fewer Californians continued to lack coverage through the year, causing Texas to end up No. 1 for its uninsured rate and total residents without insurance. However, we fell short of landing governmental confirmation of such a shift. Responding to our request for backup information, Daigle in Howard’s office emailed us a link to a September 2014 Rice University press release stating Texas "has now surpassed California to become the state with the highest number of uninsured residents." But the related report, from Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy and the Episcopal Health Foundation, said only that Texas has "potentially surpassed" California in its uninsured count. According to quarterly surveys of Texans undertaken by the researchers, an additional nearly 379,000 Texans aged 18 to 64 had health coverage after the first Obamacare enrollment period, reducing uninsurance rates among such adults from 25 percent in September 2013 to 22 percent in May 2014. An April 2015 follow-up report by the institute and foundation said that thanks to more adults obtaining coverage, the share of uninsured Texans aged 18-64 as of March 2015 had dropped even more to 17 percent. The report said: "Despite this progress, Texas remains the state with the highest percentage of uninsured residents and, for the first time, Texas now has the largest number of uninsured residents." That report did not say how the researchers decided California no longer had the most uninsured. By email to our inquiry, co-author Elena Marks told us an undated web post on Wallethub.com, a personal finance website, fueled the conclusion. After the Obamacare law took effect, she noted, WalletHub projected that 14.26 percent of Californians and 24.81 percent of Texans lacked coverage. WalletHub also said its estimates were limited to beneficiaries under 64 years of age. Those state-by-state percentages, according to WalletHub’s post, were calculated in part from a June 2014 Kaiser Family Foundation look into insurance sign-ups during the first Obamacare enrollment period, which WalletHub described as "the best estimate to date of the proportion of private health plan enrollees under Obamacare who previously lacked health insurance and therefore would be gaining coverage under the new law." Marks told us the Texas researchers multiplied the WalletHub projections by each state’s population to estimate that more than 6.8 million Texans and 5.5 million Californians were uninsured once the Obamacare law had rolled into place. Other analysts Seeking other perspectives, we queried experts including Paul Fronstin of the Washington, D.C.-based Employee Benefit Research Institute, which says its mission is to enhance the development of public policy through objective research and education. In 2012, Fronstin wrote that the year before, California had the largest number of people under age 65 without health insurance of any state, at 7.1 million. But he also wrote that with Obamacare taking effect, the western state’s share of uninsured adults would likely drop. As it was, Fronstin told us at the time, his analysis of bureau research released in March 2012 showed more Californians than Texans were lacking coverage. That also held in Fronstin’s latest analysis, published in 2013, which said that nationally in 2010-12, Texas and California were among 14 states with 20 percent or more of residents lacking insurance. California had an average of 7 million uninsured non-elderly residents, according to a chart in the report, outpacing other states including No. 2 Texas, which averaged 6.1 million uninsured non-elderly. Still, those counts reflected conditions before the Obamacare law took fuller effect. By email, Fronstin told us this month that he believes California no longer leads the nation in uninsured residents, likely due to more people there taking advantage of coverage options thanks to the state expanding Medicaid and residents otherwise buying insurance with the subsidies offered thanks to the Obamacare law. Fronstin pointed out Gallup polls taken through 2014 indicating Texas that year had the nation’s greatest share of uninsured adults (24.4 percent) for the seventh straight year. That was a slight improvement from the 27 percent rate Gallup gauged in 2013. From 2013 to 2014, per Gallup’s results, California’s adult uninsurance rate fell from 21.6 percent to 15.3 percent. We considered multiplying the 2014 Gallup percentages by federal population estimates to approximate the number of uninsured adults in each state. But Howard referred to all uninsured residents. We sought the same broad focus. On this front, Anne Dunkelberg of the Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities, which advocates for programs serving low-income Texans, guided us to a June 23, 2015, report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stating that according to its surveys undertaken through 2014, 11.5 percent of all Americans were uninsured. Also, a chart in the report indicates 19.4 percent of all Texans were uninsured at the time they were interviewed while 12 percent of Californians reported no coverage. We multiplied these percentages over July 2014 Census Bureau population estimates for each state, reaching estimates of 5.23 million uninsured Texans in 2014 and 4.66 million uninsured Californians. Next, we reached Gerald "Jerry" Kominski, director of UCLA’s Center for Health Policy Research, who said by phone that results of its 2014 survey indicating the number of uninsured Californians at that time were to be released later this summer. Kominski otherwise said our calculation using the CDC study and federal population estimates seemed reasonable. "California has been very successful in reducing the number of uninsured," Kominski said, "because of its aggressive promotion of the Affordable Care Act." We also ran our calculation by the Kaiser foundation. Researcher Rachel Garfield cautioned by phone against reaching conclusions by making calculations using figures from different sources. Generally, she said, data is not yet available to assess how many people were uninsured in each state in 2014 though the census bureau is expected to release relevant survey results in September 2015. Our ruling Howard said Texas is No. 1 in its uninsurance rate and its total uninsured residents. Texas leads the nation in its percentage of uninsured. Also, it newly looks like Texas has the greatest raw number of uninsured residents, though that’s evidently backed up only by rough calculations like our own, a clarification missing from this claim. We rate Howard’s claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-01055	"Our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/21/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-unemployment-rate-now-lower-fina/	A significant theme of President Barack Obama’s 2015 State of the Union address was that the United States economy has come back from the brink. One of the metrics he used to make this claim was unemployment rate. During his address, Obama said that "our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis." We decided to check whether that’s correct. The most recent reported monthly unemployment rate was 5.6 percent for December 2014. The last time it was that low was in June 2008, when it was also 5.6 percent. The financial crisis occurred after June 2008 -- it’s generally dated to the implosion of the Wall Street firm Lehman Brothers in September 2008. So Obama clearly has a point. That said, there are a few caveats. First, while we have no quarrel with Obama using the most basic version of the unemployment rate, it’s worth mentioning that there’s another version of the unemployment rate, known as U-6, that isn’t as favorable to the president’s case. The U-6 statistic tries to capture a broader picture of labor-market weakness than the more familiar unemployment rate. It takes into account not just people who are unemployed but also people working part-time who would rather have full-time work, as well as people who have stopped looking for work but would begin to look again if labor-market conditions improved. Because it includes these additional factors, the U-6 rate tends to track the official unemployment rate but is usually a few points higher. As it happens, the U-6 rate -- unlike the more basic unemployment rate -- hasn’t returned to its pre-financial-crisis level. The December 2014 U-6 rate was 11.2 percent, which is higher than the 11 percent rate in September 2008 and the 10.8 percent rate one month earlier in August 2008. Second, while economists cheer the clear improvement in the basic unemployment rate, they also fret that a portion of that improvement stems from Americans leaving the labor market rather than finding jobs after experiencing joblessness. (The unemployment rate can improve either if someone goes back to work, or if they leave the labor market entirely.) A way to measure this is by looking at a statistic called the labor force participation rate, which measures the number of people in the labor force divided by the civilian, noninstitutionalized population. The labor force shrinks whenever someone retires, voluntarily gives up working (such as when they become a full-time parent or go back to school full-time) or because they simply give up hope of finding a job. The labor force participation rate has decreased markedly since 2008. In September 2008, it stood at 66.0 percent, but that fell to 62.7 percent by December 2014, the most recent month available. It’s now at its lowest point since the late 1970s, a time when fewer women were working. Part of this is explained by the retirement of the large Baby Boom generation, but not all -- and the trendline worries many economists. So Obama has justification for celebrating the unemployment rate’s decline, but it’s worth remembering that that’s not the only important labor-market statistic out there. Our ruling Obama said "our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis." He’s correct when using the basic unemployment rate -- the most commonly cited figure -- but it’s worth noting that other measures of the labor market are not quite so rosy.

pomt-12404	"I’m proud to say that under my administration, as you just heard, we will be building the first new heavy icebreakers the United States has seen in over 40 years."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/may/24/donald-trump/trump-goes-bit-overboard-icebreaker-claim/	President Donald Trump told new graduates of the Coast Guard Academy that his administration is working hard to make the military branch’s job easier. In his speech at the academy’s commencement on May 17, Trump said his administration will be investing in icebreakers in a way the country hasn’t done in a while. "I’m proud to say that under my administration, as you just heard, we will be building the first new heavy icebreakers the United States has seen in over 40 years," Trump said. Trump’s statement suggested his administration was the driver behind this project. He’s right about the four-decade gap, but it takes a long time to build a big ship (it’s just one -- not plural as he said) and the plan for this ship has been underway for some time. Assessing the fleet An icebreaker can carve a path through thick sheets of ice in frozen regions of the world or to access research stations in the Arctic. The bigger the ship, the thicker the ice it can handle. The United States has just one active heavy polar icebreaker, the Polar Star, which entered service in 1976. At a speed of 3 knots it can break through ice as thick as 21 feet. A similar ship was mothballed after its engined died in 2010 In addition to the Polar Star, the country has medium icebreaker, Healy, and the National Science Foundation operates a small icebreaker named Palmer. The construction of a new, heavy icebreaker would indeed be the first for the United States in four decades, said Magnus Nordenman, director of the Transatlantic Security Initiative at the Atlantic Council’s Brent Scowcroft Center on International Security. In the works for a few years Trump left out a key fact: The process of building a new heavy icebreaker for the Coast Guard began before he took office. The U.S. Coast Guard told us the work began in earnest during President Barack Obama’s second term. "The time needed to build a new icebreaker can anywhere be between 5 to 10 years," said Sherri Goodman, a former defence official and senior fellow with the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. The Coast Guard included it in its 2012-13 budget submission, according to the Congressional Research Service. The project received about $15.6 million through FY 2016. In FY 2017, Congress gave the Coast Guard $25 million to manage the project and $150 million went to the Navy to start the design and construction process. Right now, actual building is slated to start in 2020 and if all goes well, the ship will launch in 2023. Our ruling Trump said, "I’m proud to say that under my administration, as you just heard, we will be building the first new heavy icebreakers the United States has seen in over 40 years." He has a point that the heavy icebreaker being built is the first since the 1970s. If all goes according to schedule, construction will begin in 2020 with delivery in 2023. That puts the building phase within his first term, but as with any large project, the timeline can slip. Regardless, this has been an ongoing project that has been receiving funding from the government since 2013. Trump’s statement implied that the efforts to build the icebreaker came from his administration when in fact it was already in progress before he took office. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-00668	"Once again, a police officer has been killed with an illegal gun from Georgia – a state that last year did the NRA’s bidding and weakened its already lax gun laws."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2015/may/12/everytown-gun-safety/advocacy-group-overreaches-claim-nypd-shooting/	The fatal shooting of New York City police officer Brian Moore has the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety again taking aim at Georgia and its gun laws. "Once again, a police officer has been killed with an illegal gun from Georgia -- a state that last year did the NRA’s bidding and weakened its already lax gun laws," Megan Lewis, the group’s vice president, said in a May 6 press release.. Moore, 25, was shot in the face May 2 and died two days later. Police took a convicted felon into custody 90 minutes after the shooting and later said the suspect’s weapon was one of 23 guns reported stolen in a break-in at Little’s Bait, Tackle & Pawn in Perry, south of Macon, in October 2011. Nine of those 23 stolen guns have since turned up at New York crime scenes, including the silver Taurus .38-caliber revolver seized in connection with Moore’s slaying, NYPD officials said. But have there been other police officers killed by illegal guns traced to Georgia as Everytown for Gun Safety’s statement suggests? PolitiFact decided to check. First a little background. Everytown for Gun Safety, an advocacy group founded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and gun-control advocate Shannon Watts, contends that stolen and illegally trafficked firearms are making their way to cities such as New York from Georgia and other states, especially in the South, that have lax gun laws via the so-called "iron pipeline." Erika Soto Lamb, the group’s communications, said Everytown for Gun Safety can back up the statement. As evidence, she pointed to the killings of two NYPD police officers last December in a rampage by a convicted felon. The suspect was using a gun that was first sold legally by Arrowhead Pawn Shop in Jonesboro, she said. We asked: Is it fair to say that’s "an illegal gun from Georgia?" "The shooter in that event was a convicted felon -- which means he should not have been in possession of a gun and which makes that an illegal gun," she wrote in an email.. Tracing and tracking firearms The job of tracing guns falls to the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the only agency authorized to track firearms made in the United States and abroad when law enforcement agencies request help. Police recover guns in various ways – as part of a criminal investigation, during regular patrols and even in buyback events. They can submit requests to the ATF’s National Tracing Center to track a weapon’s history, said ATF Agent Charles J. Mulham, the public information officer for the Bureau’s New York field division. Because a gun’s history can become evidence in a trial, the records are not public unless the requesting agencies disclosing them. The New York Police Department submitted such a request following the shooting of Moore in Queens. It later made the findings public in a press conference. Without required public disclosure of the trace records, the question of whether additional illegal guns from Georgia were used in the shooting deaths of other New York City cops becomes fuzzy to answer. Federal law requires only that guns stolen or lost from licensed gun dealers be reported to the ATF. The District of Columbia and another 10 states – including New York and neighboring New Jersey and Connecticut – require private citizens to report the theft or loss of at least some handguns or weapons. Georgia has no such requirement. That means those who aspire to make money by selling hard-to-come-by firearms in New York City for profit could, in theory, not even bother to steal them in Georgia. They could buy them here, sell them for high mark-ups in New York and, if the trace came back to a legal purchase, possibly face no penalty if they claimed the weapons had been stolen but not reported, Mulham said. In other words, it’s a tricky definition to term a gun "illegal" given the patchwork of state laws that govern their purchase. That complicates the definition of the gun used in the December shooting deaths of New York City officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos That gun, a Taurus 9 mm, was bought legally in 1996 from the Jonesboro pawn shop, said NYPD Lt. John Grimpel. The weapon’s history then becomes murky before convicted felon Ismaaiyl Brinsley ended up with it and shot the officers as they sat in their patrol car. It was illegal for Brinsley to have the gun, given restrictions on ownership by felons as well as New York law making it illegal for anyone to have a handgun without a permit. But the gun itself was officially legal because it was legally purchased. That history was uncovered when NYPD requested the gun be traced after the shootings. "After 1996, the whereabouts of the gun were unknown, until December 2014 when it was used in the murders of officers Ramos and Liu," Grimpel said. Our conclusion Police have seized a gun stolen from Georgia nearly four years ago and believe it was used in the recent, tragic shooting death of a young NYPD officer. But Everytown For Gun Safety overreaches in suggesting that an earlier fatal shooting of two officers involved an "illegal gun from Georgia." That weapon was sold according to federal law and therefore legal, until it found its way to someone who used it to commit a horrific crime. Such overreaches allow political debate to shape facts.

pomt-07862	Foreign Trade Zones allow U.S. "land to be inhabited by Chinese communists -- communists straight from China! They are to set up little towns and live here."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/09/chain-email/chain-e-mail-claims-foreign-trade-zones-are-chines/	In recent weeks, we’ve received a number of requests from readers to check a chain e-mail about Free Trade Zones. The full chain e-mail is too long to print, but you can read the full version here. Following is an excerpt: "This is an urgent message! Read this and spread the word! Subject: Foreign Trade Zones. This is unbelievable at first, but you will soon realize that there are several motives for the global communists to physically weave our United States territory together with communist China. Read On! Here's what is going on! "Each and every one of our state governors has approved and allocated a certain amount of acres of their U.S. state land to be inhabited by Chinese communists -- communists straight from China! They are to set up little towns and live here, supposedly for the purpose of producing Chinese products for sale in the U.S.A. The land the states are giving them for their little towns will be considered "foreign territory"!!! We are told that the laws of the state (in which these Chinese communists dwell) will apply to the communist Foreign Trade Zone (FTZ). Comment: If so, why are they allowed in here!??! Isn't the whole set up unlawful??? There are 257 of these little communist towns to be built all over the United States." There’s a lot to check in this excerpt, and even more in the parts we didn’t reprint. To keep to a reasonable length, we will only look at one part of it -- the idea that Foreign Trade Zones allow "land to be inhabited by Chinese communists -- communists straight from China! They are to set up little towns and live here." First, a little background about Foreign Trade Zones. In the United States, foreign-trade zones, or FTZs, date to a 1934 act of Congress. FTZs are secure areas located in or near U.S. Customs ports of entry but legally considered to be outside the Customs territory for the purpose of tariff laws and Customs entry procedures. Certain types of merchandise can be imported into the zones without paying import duties or excise taxes. Once there, the merchandise can be stored, assembled, sorted, processed or otherwise manufactured. But duties are paid only when the merchandise is transferred outside the zone and into the U.S. for sale or use. According to the federal board that oversees FTZs, the idea is to improve U.S. competitiveness by encouraging companies to maintain operations in the U.S. FTZs give foreign companies a good reason to locate here and thus use U.S. labor, services and materials. (U.S. companies, for their part, can use FTZs in many other countries around the world, with similar benefits.) So now let’s look at some of the claims in the e-mail. The idea that these "little towns will be considered ‘foreign territory’" is false. Aside from tax and tariff rules, FTZs must conform to U.S. laws, not those of the foreign country of the companies operating within them. Meanwhile, the notion that the "motive" behind FTZs is to "physically weave our United States territory together with communist China" is ridiculous. Not only are FTZs part of U.S. territory rather than that of a foreign country, but they were signed into law a full 15 years before the Communist Party took over the Chinese government. Most important for our fact check, it is false to say that Chinese communists "are to set up little towns and live here, supposedly for the purpose of producing Chinese products for sale in the U.S.A." If you look at the act governing FTZs, it reads: "No person shall be allowed to reside within the zone except Federal, State, or municipal officers or agents whose resident presence is deemed necessary by the Board." Nothing has changed that portion of the law in the nearly eight decades since. A fact sheet from the U.S. Commerce Department confirms that the "FTZ Act prohibits residence within a zone." So let’s sum up. Whatever one thinks of the policy benefits of FTZs, the idea put forth by the chain e-mail -- that Foreign Trade Zones allow "land to be inhabited by Chinese communists -- communists straight from China! They are to set up little towns and live here" -- is wrong. FTZs are U.S. territory, and subject to U.S. laws, in every way except for certain tax and duty laws, and in any case, "Chinese communists," and almost everyone else, are barred by law from residing in them. The e-mail takes a longstanding part of U.S. law and turns it into a communist plot to take over the country. We consider that ridiculous, and rate it Pants on Fire!

pomt-11770	The GOP tax plan "Sabotages the health care of 13 MILLION Americans."	half-true	/california/statements/2017/nov/29/nancy-pelosi/pelosis-problematic-claim-gop-tax-plan-sabotages-h/	Many Democrats in Congress describe the GOP tax plan as a scheme to benefit the wealthy at the expense of the middle class. In recent weeks, their attacks have been expanded to say it would take away or damage health care for millions of Americans. That particular criticism started after Senate Republicans added a provision to their tax overhaul bill that would eliminate the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate — the requirement that Americans have health insurance or pay a penalty. GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine has expressed concern over the inclusion of this provision in the tax bill, which needs approval from nearly all Republican senators to pass. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was the latest Democrat to lodge a comparable criticism of the bill. The GOP tax plan "Sabotages the health care of 13 MILLION Americans," Pelosi’s political team wrote on Twitter on Nov. 27, 2017 as part of a longer list of criticisms of the bill. PolitiFact New York and The Washington Post have fact-checked similar statements by Democratic leaders about the bill's impact on health care. They found those claims were partially accurate but ignored key facts. We’ll take a look at those and rate Pelosi’s statement. Similar claims Earlier this month, PolitiFact New York rated Half True the claim by Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo: Congressional Republicans "want to take health care from millions of Americans in order to pay for" a tax bill. It found Cuomo had a point: Ending the individual mandate would result in an estimated 13 million fewer Americans with health coverage by 2027, according to the Congressional Budget Office analysis. Pelosi’s spokesman pointed to the same CBO report when PolitiFact California asked for evidence backing up the congresswoman’s claim. In its analysis, however, PolitiFact New York pointed out that ending the individual mandate isn’t the same thing as stripping away health insurance for a large number of Americans. While some would lose access to health insurance due to increased premiums, many others would drop their coverage voluntarily. The Washington Post Fact Checker, meanwhile, gave Two Pinocchios — which it describes as its Half True rating — to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer when he said, "We’re kicking 13 million people off health insurance to give tax cuts to the wealthy." The Post described the first part of Schumer’s statement as "problematic." "CBO, in estimating the impact of repealing the individual mandate, is mostly describing a voluntary action of people choosing not to buy health insurance. That’s not the same as "kicking off" 13 million people. Granted, some people may feel they don’t have a choice because their premiums increased. Senate Democrats need to more accurately describe the CBO report," the Post concluded. Sabotage? Pelosi, through her political team’s tweet, claims the GOP tax plan "sabotages" the health care of 13 million Americans. We took this to mean it intentionally strips health care from millions. If healthy people leave the individual market, premiums will go up for the remaining and sicker enrollees. That could force some people to drop their plans due to cost. But, as with the claims from Cuomo and Schumer, the statement from Pelosi and her staff ignores the fact that a large portion of the 13 million people would voluntarily drop their plans and would not see a direct health impact. PolitiFact New York cited research from RAND Corp. that estimated roughly two-thirds of disenrollment would stem from voluntary choices and one-third would be involuntary. Other research has put the percentage at about 50-50, said Linda Blumberg, a health policy specialist at the Urban Institute. Our ruling Nancy Pelosi recently claimed the GOP tax plan "Sabotages the health care of 13 MILLION Americans." She has a partial point: Senate Republicans have proposed eliminating the ACA’s requirement that all Americans have health insurance or pay a penalty. By getting rid of this, the CBO estimates 13 million fewer people would have insurance a decade from now. Many would voluntarily leave the individual health care marketplace, driving up premiums for those who remain, forcing some who want to keep their insurance to drop it. But like other top Democrats, Pelosi left out much of the story. "Sabotaged" just doesn’t fit for the two-thirds of those researchers say would leave voluntarily. PolitiFact New York and The Washington Post examined similar claims and rated them the equivalent of Half True. They were partially accurate but omitted key information. We agreed with their assessments. We also rate Pelosi’s claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

pomt-13642	Says in 2012 "Obama won in every state that did not require a photo ID and lost in every state that did require a photo ID in order to vote."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/09/viral-image/viral-post-claiming-voter-fraud-2012-election-errs/	A viral post shared on several websites claims to offer evidence that President Barack Obama benefited from voter fraud during his 2012 reelection race against Mitt Romney. Headlined "Ever Wonder Why Republicans Want Voter ID?" the post offers factoids that seem to point to voter fraud in critical states. We've rated the Florida claims Pants on Fire! PolitiFact is also looking at the claims about Pennsylvania and Ohio in separate fact-checks. For this item, we'll look at the "fun fact" at the end of the meme: "Obama won in every state that did not require a photo ID and lost in every state that did require a photo ID in order to vote." It's clear from the context that the post is talking about the 2012 election, because it mentions Republican Mitt Romney twice. So did voter ID determine whether Obama won or lost in a state? Not at all. We checked with the National Conference of State Legislatures, the nonpartisan Washington-based organization that keeps track of which states have voter identification laws and rates the rigidity of those laws. The group made a tally of the mandatory photo ID laws in effect for the 2012 election. It's true that Obama lost in the states that had a strict photo-only ID requirement in 2012, but merely four states — Georgia, Indiana, Kansas and Tennessee — had that requirement, a salient fact the post neglects to mention. (A few more states have added a strict photo ID requirement that apply in the 2016 elections.) That a Democrat would lose in those states, regardless of a photo ID requirement, is not surprising. Georgia and Indiana have voted for Republican candidates in seven of the last eight presidential elections since 1984, Tennessee has done it in six out of eight, and Kansas has done it in eight out of eight. This trend pre-dated the photo ID laws, the first of which was implemented in 2008. The post is ridiculously wrong when it says Obama won in every state that did not require a photo ID. Obama lost in 20 of the 46 states without a strict photo ID requirement. If you include the seven additional states that asked for a photo ID but allowed other types of identification as well, such as a credit or debit card in the voter's name, Obama won four (Florida, Hawaii, Michigan and New Hampshire) and lost three (Idaho, Louisiana and South Dakota). The post does not identify who created it. Our ruling An anonymous, viral post claims that in 2012, "Obama won in every state that did not require a photo ID and lost in every state that did require a photo ID in order to vote." Obama did lose in the four states that had such a law in effect in 2012, but those states historically vote Republican in presidential elections anyway. The post is flat wrong about Obama winning states that do not require a photo ID. He lost in 20 states that lacked the requirement. On the whole, we rate the statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ae22eaa3-6b2d-4ae8-b909-e0b3d8f543fd	None	Viral image	None	None	None	2016-08-09T10:00:00	2016-08-05	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-03674	On allowing a vote on universal gun background checks in the U.S. Senate.	no flip	/georgia/statements/2013/apr/26/johnny-isakson/senator-consistently-favor-vote-gun-background-che/	The recent legislation in the U.S. Senate to expand background checks on guns was one of the highest-profile votes this year. The measure eventually failed on a 54-46 vote. Senate rules required it to get at least 60 votes in order to succeed. But some gun advocates were angry the measure even came up for a vote. Some PolitiFact Georgia readers wrote to us, asking whether U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., flip-flopped on an earlier position when he voted to allow that vote to go forward in the Senate. Isakson voted against the actual background check bill. PolitiFact Georgia wanted to know whether Isakson staked out one position on a background-check filibuster and then reneged. President Barack Obama called for several new measures aimed at limiting access to guns to criminals and the mentally ill after the horrific killings in December at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. One proposal was universal background checks. Federal law currently requires federally licensed gun dealers to conduct background checks, commonly known as "universal background checks," before selling a firearm. There is no federal law that requires private gun dealers to do such background checks. A handful of states (Georgia is not one of them) require private dealers to conduct background checks. Gun control advocates want to require private dealers to conduct such a check. Earlier this month, two senators who’ve received high marks from the National Rifle Association (Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Republican Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania), proposed an amendment they hoped would receive wide bipartisan support from their colleagues. The amendment would subject nearly all gun buyers to background checks. Isakson said during an interview April 9 with "CBS This Morning" that he had concerns about such legislation, including that background checks may "violate rights to privacy in terms of mental health." Isakson received an "A" rating from the NRA in his last campaign, The Atlanta Journal Constitution reported. But the senator, unlike many of his GOP colleagues, indicated he didn’t want a filibuster on the proposal. A filibuster allows unlimited debate continued on the grounds that any senator should have the right to speak as long as necessary on any issue. "I think it deserves a vote up or down, " Isakson said in the CBS interview. On April 11, the Senate voted 68-31 in favor of the "motion to proceed" on the gun bill, allowing it to come to the floor and have amendment votes. Isakson voted in favor of moving forward. So, too, did Georgia’s other U.S. senator, Saxby Chambliss, a Republican. But Republicans could still have blocked the bill after it was amended by setting up another 60-vote hurdle to end debate. As a vote on the Manchin/Toomey amendment and others drew closer, the thinking on Capitol Hill was that the measure could not get 60 votes once the NRA announced its opposition. The Washington Post reported that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, decided to allow votes on nine amendments, requiring a 60-vote majority in order for them to pass. Any of those amendments could have been filibustered on their own if the vote threshold was set at 51. In addition, it allowed Reid to control the action. "So, why didn’t Reid try to get the unanimous consent agreement to set all amendment votes at a 51-vote threshold?" The Post wrote. "Because to do that would have opened the bill up to the very likely possibility that amendments favored by gun rights advocates would be added to it." On April 17, Isakson and Chambliss voted against the actual amendment. The Senate voted 54-46 in favor. Again, it did not receive the 60 votes necessary for it to more forward. Georgia Gun Owners, a group that claims about 10,000 members, held a protest in front of Isakson’s home after he voted in favor of bringing the amendment to a floor vote. "He certainly didn’t flip-flop on the filibuster," said Patrick Parsons, the group’s executive director. "He never said he wanted to (support a filibuster)." Jerry Henry, executive director of Georgia Carry, a 7,300-member gun advocacy group, said he was not aware of Isakson supporting a filibuster on the amendment. "He voted to kill the filibuster and allowed it to get on the floor and then he voted against the bill," Henry said. "As far as I know, (Isakson) said he would not support a filibuster." To sum up, Isakson voted against a filibuster on the background check amendment, backing up his talk of desiring an up-or-down vote on the measure. Isakson did eventually vote against the legislation. The senator receives a rating of No Flip. Atlanta Journal-Constitution staff writer Daniel Malloy contributed to this article.

pomt-05831	On resigning from the Texas Railroad Commission.	full flop	/texas/statements/2012/feb/17/elizabeth-ames-jones/did-elizabeth-ames-jones-flip-flop-resigning/	Elizabeth Ames Jones’ resignation from the Texas Railroad Commission on Feb. 13, 2012, came weeks after state Sen. Jeff Wentworth of San Antonio began claiming that she was violating the Texas Constitution by remaining in her post while also running against him. A day after she resigned, Austin American-Statesman reporter Jason Embry on Twitter pointed to a January 2011 blog post he wrote in which Jones is quoted as saying that she would "never" leave her post on the commission, which regulates the oil and gas industry in Texas. We put Jones’ change of heart to our Flip-O-Meter. Embry’s Jan. 25, 2011, blog post was written as Jones was traveling the state to announce her candidacy for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Kay Bailey Hutchison after this year. The post quotes Jones as saying outside the Texas Capitol: "The days of backroom deals, secret earmarks, wasteful pork-barrel spending will come to a screeching halt when I am elected." According to the post, Jones also said she would not resign her commission seat to concentrate on her campaign, though she wouldn’t seek re-election in 2012. Next, the post points out that Michael Williams, then Jones’ colleague on the commission and an expected Senate candidate, had already announced his resignation from the three-person commission, effective April 2, 2011. "I would never leave my post," Jones was quoted as saying. The Quorum Report’s Texas Energy Report included the same "never" statement from Jones in its story about her Austin campaign stop. "She’s not following colleague and fellow hopeful Michael Williams’ lead by resigning her seat on the three-member panel," says the story, before quoting Jones as saying she would "never" leave her post. About nine months later, Jones switched races, jumping into the Republican primary contest against Wentworth for this state Senate seat. Fourteen weeks after that, she quit the commission. We searched — on the Internet and in newspaper archives — and talked to representatives of the Wentworth and Jones campaigns for evidence that Jones had otherwise vowed not to leave the commission. We found no additional "never" proclamations from Jones, though the Fort Worth Star-Telegram and the Dallas Morning News reported her saying during her January 2011 announcement tour that she would not resign from the commission. On Dec. 9, 2011, Wentworth, who faces Jones and Donna Campbell of New Braunfels for the Republican nomination, issued a statement suggesting that Jones could not legally fulfill a constitutional requirement that statewide elected officials live in the capital and also qualify as a resident of the San Antonio-rooted Senate district. Jones disputed his analysis, saying she had legal advice indicating that she could continue on the commission while pursuing the Senate seat. In a statement announcing her resignation, Jones noted that she had tried to resolve the legal dispute by asking Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott "to issue an opinion vindicating my right to finish my term on the Texas Railroad Commission." However, her statement suggested, that hope was dashed by a Feb. 6, 2012, lawsuit, which sought to stop Jones from receiving her state paycheck. She said any such suit would prevent the attorney general from issuing an opinion until its resolution. As we closed out this look, we asked Jones for an interview. She wasn’t immediately available. In an earlier telephone interview, Jones’ political consultant, Todd Olsen, argued that Jones had not flip-flopped by resigning from the commission after previously saying she would not quit it. Olsen noted that Jones’ January 2011 comment that she would "never leave" her post was made when she was running for a different office and under different circumstances. Olsen said that Jones spoke after Williams had announced his resignation and that if she had followed suit, the Railroad Commission would have been left inoperable with only one commissioner (until the governor named a replacement). Olsen also noted that Jones clearly could not have been speaking to whether she’d stay on the commission while running for the Texas Senate. Another facet, in Olsen’s view: In late 2010 and early 2011, lawmakers were discussing how to restructure the Railroad Commission, possibly reducing it to a single position from three, a proposal that Jones did not support. Olsen speculated that if the question Jones was answering related to that possible shrinkage, Jones would make the same "never" vow today. Our ruling Jones initially said she would never leave her post, meaning resign. She later did so, nearly 11 months before the term ends. It’s believable that the commission’s circumstances and other factors changed in the intervening year. Regardless, Jones’ resignation after saying she’d "never" quit the commission amounts to a Full Flop.

pomt-12430	Says "Karen Handel’s office budget increased a whopping 42 percent."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2017/may/17/dccc-lgo/georgia-dem-attack-gops-handel-falls-wide-mark/	The race in Georgia’s 6th Congressional District tests whether Democrats can turn anger toward President Donald Trump into votes, and whether Republicans can transcend that anger in a district that has long been safe GOP territory. With a little over a month before the June 20 special election, the Democratic ad campaign went on the attack. Both the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee -- the electoral arm of House Democrats -- and the campaign to elect Jon Ossoff ran commercials targeting Republican Karen Handel. The DCCC ad cast Handel as a politician who enjoyed the comforts of office. "Georgia experienced the worst budget crisis since the Great Depression," the ad said. "For years, we saw cuts to education, cuts to law enforcement, and rising college tuition. Yet Secretary of State Karen Handel’s office budget increased a whopping 42 percent." Is that true? The answer depends on what you think when you hear the term "office budget." State budget experts at Georgia State University and the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute helped us work through the official budget documents. There was general agreement that the first budget Handel helped shaped was in early 2007. She stepped down as secretary of state in December 2009, so the last budgets she worked under fell in 2009 and 2010. We compared both to 2007. We found the administrative cost of running the secretary of state’s office rose by nearly 39 percent from 2007 to 2009, or 47 percent from 2007 to 2010 -- which is close but not quite what the ad claimed. However, the cost of the department overall actually fell by about 8 percent from 2007 to 2009, or 10 percent from 2007 to 2010. Here are the numbers: 2007 2009 Change from 2007 2010 Change from 2007 Office Admin. $4,882,454 $6,782,167 +38.9% $7,167,144 +46.8% Total $30,762,868 $28,381,868 -7.7% $27,730,509 -9.9% The key here is the distinction of administration costs versus the budget of the entire department. Evan Lukaske, DCCC spokesman, told us his group pulled the 42 percent figure from a 2010 Associated Press article, which said, "During her three years as secretary of state, the office's administration budget jumped by about 42 percent, according to state records." More recently, a local television station confirmed that figure. (The slight difference in numbers stems from the more conservative budget assumptions we used following the guidance of budget experts.) More to the story There’s an important backstory to the spending increase that puts the number in a different light. Between 2008 and 2009, there was a reshuffling of activities within the secretary of state’s office. It had investigators spread across three separate programs. Handel consolidated them. Handel spokeswoman Kate Constantini said the easiest way to do that was to add that work to an existing line in the budget. "That line item was part of the front office budget, which necessarily showed an increase, but was the result of moving personnel that were accounted for in other parts of the budget," Constantini said. The state budget brief for 2008-09 backs up Handel’s account. The rise in the administrative budget was offset by decreases in certain activities of other divisions within the department. As such, the spending increases are largely only on paper. In reality, money was shuffled around. Our ruling Democrats say Handel saw her office budget rise 42 percent. While some viewers might not spot the distinction between the administrative budget and the budget for the entire office, the raw numbers support the claim. But most of that increase came from moving around work -- and the money to pay for it -- inside the department. The rise in the administrative budget was offset by cuts elsewhere. The ad’s statement contains an element of truth, but leaves out critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-12263	"Western New Yorkers pay some of the highest property taxes in the state."	half-true	/new-york/statements/2017/jul/07/raymond-walter/where-are-property-taxes-highest-new-york/	New York state has some of the highest property taxes in the country. But where in the state are property taxes highest? Assemblyman Ray Walter, R-Amherst, says Western New York ranks high. "Western New Yorkers pay some of the highest property taxes in the state," Walter said in a recent press release about Republican efforts to replace Obamacare. He supports a part of a congressional bill designed to reduce property taxes in New York state by shifting Medicaid costs from counties to the state. Walter said he was talking about property taxes as a percent of home value in Western New York. He defines the region as the eight counties west of the Finger Lakes: Erie, Niagara, Chautauqua, Allegany, Cattaraugus, Orleans, Wyoming and Genesee counties. "It’s off the charts as a percentage of home value," Walter told PolitiFact New York. "In real dollars it’s not as high just because our home values are not as high as other places in the state." Is Walter right that Western New York has some of the highest property taxes in the state? Percent of home value U.S. Census Bureau data shows how property taxes compared with home values in each county in 2015, the latest figures. It’s a better apples-to-apples comparison because some counties have higher home values but similar property tax bills. The home value in Brooklyn is more than triple that of Sullivan County, for example, but the property tax bills are within a few hundred dollars of each other. All eight counties in Western New York rank among the 18 highest counties in the state for property taxes as a percent of home value. • Orleans County ranks first out of the state’s 62 counties. Its median property tax of $3,055 is 3.35 percent of its $91,300 median home value. • Allegany County ranks second. The $2,320 median property tax bill is 3.3 percent of the $70,300 median home value. • Erie County ranks lowest in the region, but 18th highest in the state. Its median property tax bill is $3,499, which is 2.69 percent of its median home value of $130,000. The data is only reported for owner-occupied housing units. It does not include property taxes on businesses or rented units. Property taxes in dollars The ten counties with the highest median property tax in dollar amounts are in New York City, the lower Hudson Valley and on Long Island. Western New York counties are lower in this category. Four of them rank in the bottom half. • Erie County has the highest property tax in the region. The county ranks 21st in the state. • Niagara County, where the median property tax bill is $3,255, is second highest in the region but 26th in the state. • Allegany County has the lowest median property tax in dollars in Western New York. Only five other counties in the state are lower. Three counties tie for highest property taxes in the state — and the country. Nassau, Rockland, and Westchester counties each have median property tax bills that exceed $10,000. That’s the highest amount in the country as well. The Census Bureau does not report exact dollar amounts when the median tax exceeds $10,000. Percent of income Property taxes can also be measured as a share of median household income. The eight counties in Western New York rank in the middle in this category. • Wyoming County, where the tax bill is $2,871, is lowest in the region. Residents spend 5.29 percent of the median income of $52,564 on property taxes. Fifteen counties have lower property tax bills as a percent of median resident income. • Erie County is again highest in the region. Residents there pay 6.83 percent of the median income of $51,247 toward property taxes. Twenty-one counties are higher. Nassau, Rockland, and Westchester counties tie for first in this category. At least ten percent of the median income in each is spent on property taxes. Our ruling Walter said "Western New Yorkers pay some of the highest property taxes in the state." His statement might come as a surprise to homeowners on Long Island and other counties near New York City, where median property tax bills exceed $10,000. To them, Erie County's median property tax bill of $3,499 doesn't look too high. So, no, Western New Yorkers do not pay some of the highest property taxes in the state. But Western New Yorkers shoulder a heavier burden paying the property tax. Walter said he was talking about property taxes as a percent of home value. And in that sense, he’s right about the tax. Two Western New York counties lead the state in this category and all eight counties in the region are among the top third. We rate his claim Half True.

pomt-12883	"Here in Philadelphia murder has been steady — I mean — just terribly increasing."	false	/pennsylvania/statements/2017/jan/26/donald-trump/donald-trump-falsely-tells-gop-philly-homicides-ar/	Donald Trump made his first visit to Philadelphia as president today and at the beginning of his speech at the GOP Retreat said it was "great" to be in the city. Then things went south. Trump said, "Here in Philadelphia, murder has been steady — I mean — just terribly increasing." So what’s really happening with homicides in Philadelphia? In 2016, according to year-end data from the police department, 277 people were killed in the city. That number is down from 2015, when 280 people were killed; and up from 2014, when 248 people were killed. Homicides since the mid 2000s, however, are way down. In 2007, Philly had 391 murders. Go back to the 1990s, and Philadelphia’s murder rate was even higher. Five hundred people were killed in 1990. The murder rate decreased throughout the 1990s before going back up in the early 2000s and falling since then. The 277 people killed in 2016 is the third-lowest amount since 1990 and down about 45 percent from the 1990 peak. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We reached out to White House spokesperson Steven N. Cheung for comment. We’ll update if we hear back. Mayor Jim Kenney released a statement Thursday afternoon saying the president’s comments were "insulting" to police. "Our police officers have worked tirelessly and with great personal sacrifice to get Philadelphia’s crime rate down to its lowest point in forty years, while also successfully implementing reforms to strengthen police-community relations and uphold the rights of all our residents," he said in the statement. He continued: "Our homicides are, in fact, slowly declining, and while we are not satisfied with even our current numbers, we are handicapped by Republican refusal to enact any kind of common sense gun control and by their obsession with turning our police officers into ICE agents — which will prevent immigrants from coming forward to report crimes or provide critical witnesses statements that can put dangerous criminals behind bars." Our Ruling President Donald Trump, while addressing the GOP Retreat at the Loews Hotel, said, "Here in Philadelphia murder has been steady — I mean — just terribly increasing." The murder rate was higher last year than it was in 2014 and 2013, but it was lower than in 2015 and the third-lowest it has been since 1990. The murder rate in 2016 was about 45 percent lower than in 1990, when 500 people were killed. We rule the claim False.

pomt-05003	Says Debbie Wasserman Schultz "has these offshore accounts" like Mitt Romney.	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/jul/18/mary-matalin/debbie-wasserman-schultz-had-offshore-accounts-mit/	So Mitt Romney had a Swiss bank account. Big deal! That's the argument Republican pundit Mary Matalin deployed about Romney’s finances on ABC’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos. Responding to comments from fellow panelist George F. Will that Romney needed to be more forthcoming about his finances, Matalin said, "With deference and respect to my esteemed colleague here, people don't care where his bank accounts are. They care that they don't have much left in their bank accounts. ... "They don't care about his taxes. They care about their own taxes," she continued. "He's released 2010. He's releasing 2011. He has full disclosure. "There's no tax advantages to being offshore," she said. "Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the handpicked Democratic chairman by Barack Obama, has these offshore accounts." The mention of Wasserman Schultz -- the head of the Democratic National Committee and one of Florida’s more high-profile members of Congress -- caught our attention. Does Wasserman Schultz have offshore accounts similar to Romney’s? Before Romney became governor of Massachusetts in 2003, he had a long career managing Bain Capital, a private equity investment firm, and that work made him wealthy. We fact-checked whether Romney had a Swiss bank account and found that accurate. The trustee for the Romney family’s investments -- Brad Malt of the law firm Ropes & Gray -- set up the account in 2003. There were no tax advantages to holding the Swiss account, said Malt in a conference call with reporters in January 2012, when the campaign released Mitt and Ann Romney’s 2010 tax returns. The account contained approximately $3 million, and it was held by Union Bank Switzerland, or UBS. "The tax is fully paid, just as if this were a U.S. bank account, nothing more complicated than that," Malt said then. And in our review, we found nothing to indicate Romney did anything illegal or improper with the account, just as Matalin said. Now, let’s look at Wasserman Schultz’s finances. As we researched, we found similar claims about Wasserman Schultz and offshore accounts that pointed back to the conservative magazine and website the Weekly Standard. The Weekly Standard combed through Wasserman Schultz’s financial disclosures, which are required from all members of Congress. It found several 401(k) funds listed there, then cross-referenced the funds with their published holdings. The Davis Financial Fund "is invested in the Julius Baer Group Ltd. and the State Bank of India GDR Ltd., as well as other financial, insurance, bank institutions," the Weekly Standard noted. Julius Baer is a Swiss private banking group. We went through the disclosure statements and found what the Weekly Standard described. To refresh your memory on 401(k) funds: They’re retirement savings accounts where workers can sock away money and defer paying taxes on it. Money managers then invest the savings in all sorts of ways, both in the U.S. and abroad. In some ways, the Weekly Standard’s point is fair and relevant: It’s a global economy, and many Americans have investments overseas through their own 401(k)s and pension funds. Some of the attacks on Romney suggest that his Swiss account had some nefarious function, and we haven’t seen any evidence to support that. Matalin sent us this statement, emailed from a spokesperson, that reiterated that point: "The attack from Obama wasn't about the size of the account but the very existence of it. There is nothing illegal or unique about these accounts. My response was two-fold: Obama is a hypocrite since his own appointees have the same arrangements and using a distraction tactic because he can't run on his record." Still, with all due respect to the globally interconnected economy, Wasserman Schultz’s "offshore accounts" have little in common with Romney’s. For one thing, the amounts of money in the accounts are of staggeringly different size. Wasserman Schultz’s 401(k) fund had less than $15,000. Romney had up to $3 million. Wasserman Schultz’s money was in a 401(k) account, the Davis Financial Fund, which is based in Massachusetts. It was purchased April 15, 2010, and sold on April 23, 2010. So it wasn’t held for very long. Romney’s money was in a cash savings account held from 2003 to 2010, according to his attorney. After hearing Matalin’s comments, we also wondered whether Wasserman Schultz and Romney are in the same league financially. They’re not. Wasserman Schultz’s net worth -- all her assets minus all her liabilities -- was somewhere between $235,000 and negative $290,000 in 2010, according to the most recent disclosure. In fact, Wasserman Schultz was one of the least wealthy members of Congress that year. The Center for Responsive Politics ranked her at No. 422 out of 440 House members. (The list is slightly larger than 435 seats in the House due to special elections.) Romney’s wealth, on the other hand, is somewhere between $85 million and $264 million. The Romney campaign told the Washington Post that a more accurate range would be between $190 million and $250 million. Our ruling Matalin said that Romney might have offshore accounts, but so do others. "Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the handpicked Democratic chairman by Barack Obama, has these offshore accounts," she said. Actually, Wasserman Schultz had a 401(k) account of less than $15,000, managed by an American company, that included some foreign investments. Romney’s account was a savings account of approximately $3 million held by a Swiss bank. Matalin does have a point that Romney’s account was entirely legal and he paid taxes on the earnings. It’s also true that many Americans have foreign investments through 401(k)s and pension funds. But Wasserman Schultz’s investments are not similar to Romney’s, neither in size nor in type. We rate Matalin’s claim Mostly False.	None	Mary Matalin	None	None	None	2012-07-18T11:27:14	2012-07-15	['Debbie_Wasserman_Schultz', 'Mitt_Romney']
pomt-03762	Says 90 percent of Americans and 74 percent of National Rifle Association members support background checks of gun purchasers.	true	/texas/statements/2013/apr/04/lee-leffingwell/lee-leffingwell-says-polls-show-90-percent-america/	Joining calls for criminal background checks prior to every U.S. gun purchase, Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell said the idea is widely popular. Ninety percent of Americans and 74 percent of National Rifle Association members support universal background checks, Leffingwell said, the Austin American-Statesman reported in a news article posted online the day he spoke, March 28, 2013. Currently, background checks are required in sales by federally licensed gun dealers but not for gun sales by private sellers. President Barack Obama wants to require criminal background checks for all gun sales. The National Rifle Association, which opposes universal background checks, has suggested that an expansion would fail to rope in criminals. As noted in a January 2013 fact check by our colleagues in Washington, Republican pollster Frank Luntz’s organization, Luntz Global, conducted a May 2012 poll of 945 gun owners nationwide, half of whom were gun owners who were "current or lapsed" members of the National Rifle Association and half of whom were non-NRA gun owners. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. Leffingwell aide Amy Everhart said by email that the mayor based his NRA reference on the same poll, as cited by the group that commissioned it, Mayors Against Illegal Guns. Everhart said Leffingwell also drew his conclusion about other polls from the group, which consists of city mayors concerned with illegal guns and gun violence as helmed by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, an independent, and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino, a Democrat. Its five Texas members include Leffingwell as well as the mayor of neighboring West Lake Hills, Dave Claunch, and Houston Mayor Annise Parker. A week before Leffingwell spoke, Everhart pointed out, Bloomberg delivered remarks in New York noting that polls in 41 congressional districts suggest an average of 86 percent to 89 percent of likely voters support universal background checks. "That’s in line with other recent polls that have found that more than 90 percent of Americans support background checks for all gun buyers," Bloomberg said before revisiting the May 2012 poll that reached current and former NRA members. That poll found that 82 percent of gun owners were in favor of required background checks, including 74 percent of individuals with current or former memberships in the NRA. Contacted previously by PolitiFact, the NRA offered no comment on the poll. But the group previously reacted to a 2009 poll taken by Luntz for the mayors’ group by noting that Luntz could not have had access to the association’s confidential membership roll. It also criticized Luntz, a widely quoted communications consultant for Republican politicians and Fortune 100 companies, with decade-old criticism from two polling organizations. The association did not directly challenge the poll results. PolitiFact identified two other 2013 polls of gun owners. A Pew Research Center poll taken of 1,502 adults from Jan. 9-13, 2013, found 85 percent of some 529 polled gun owners in favor of making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks — nearly identical to the Luntz poll. The gun-owner results had a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points. A CBS/New York Times poll conducted of 1,110 adults from Jan. 11-15, 2013, showed that 85 percent of respondents living in a household with an NRA member supported universal background checks. More recently, according to the results of a national January 2013 poll presented in the March 21, 2013, New England Journal of Medicine, 84 percent of gun owners and 74 percent of NRA members supported requiring a universal background-check system for all gun sales. The poll was conducted by GfK Knowledge Networks for researchers led by Colleen L. Barry, an associate professor of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. And what of Americans in general? The January Pew poll found 85 percent of all respondents in favor of making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks, with comparable support from Republicans, Democrats and independents, Pew said. The margin of error for the entire sample was 2.9 percentage points. The CBS/New York Times poll indicated that 92 percent of all the respondents favor background checks for all potential gun buyers. The poll had an overall margin of error of three percentage points. PolitiFact Georgia, looking into a similar claim about support for universal checks, noted a Fox News poll conducted Jan. 15-17, 2013, of 1,008 registered voters. Ninety one percent of respondents said they favor "requiring criminal background checks on all gun buyers, including those buying at gun shows and private sales." A Quinnipiac University national survey of 772 registered voters, taken Jan. 30 through Feb. 4, 2013, found 92 percent supporting background checks for all gun buyers. The survey, pointed out by Everhart, had a margin of error of 2.3 percentage points. A subsequent Quinnipiac University survey, taken of 1,944 registered voters from Feb. 27, 2013 through March 4, 2013, found 88 percent in favor of background checks for all gun buyers. The poll had a margin of error of 2.2 percentage points. Our ruling Austin’s mayor said 90 percent of Americans and 74 percent of National Rifle Association members support universal background checks for gun purchases. Polls taken in 2012 and 2013 support both figures, though one taken closest to Leffingwell’s press conference indicates support among all Americans possibly slipping a bit below 90 percent. Also, the 2012 poll he cited for NRA members rolled together responses of current and former/lapsed members. Then again, a 2013 poll similarly suggests that 74 percent of NRA members favor universal background checks. We rate this claim as True.

pomt-11746	Says the concealed carry bill would allow residents of certain states to "travel to your community and walk right into a school zone with a loaded weapon, no matter what local laws say."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/dec/07/brendan-boyle/no-gop-concealed-carry-bill-does-not-block-states-/	The House passed a bill Dec. 6 that would make permits to carry a concealed weapon issued in one state valid in all other states, similarly to how driver’s licenses are recognized across state lines. Republicans attached the concealed carry measure to a bipartisan bill to strengthen the national background check system, causing House Democrats to sour on the legislative package. On the eve of the vote, one Democratic lawmaker warned the expansion of concealed-carry rights would prevent states from keeping guns away from schools. "There are 12 states that don’t require permits for carrying guns. Under #HR38, someone from one of those states could travel to your community and walk right into a school zone with a loaded weapon, no matter what local laws say," Rep. Brendan Boyle, D-Pa., tweeted Dec. 5, referring to House Resolution 38. "This bill is a nightmare. #StopCCR." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com As the House-passed bill moves to the Senate, we decided to look at whether Boyle’s claim about the effects on state gun laws was correct. It turns out his read on the bill is misleading. Concealed-carry reciprocity Historically, each state has determined its own scheme for regulating concealed carry, which led to the current patchwork of varying laws and standards across the country. Thirty-eight states require gun owners to obtain a state-issued permit before than can lawfully carry a concealed weapon in public. A dozen states — as Boyle noted — require no permit. Traditionally, states have decided for themselves whether to honor out-of-state permits, a legal concept known as "reciprocity." Under the broad strokes of the House-passed Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, having a concealed-carry permit issued by one state makes it legal to carry in any state. And according to Boyle, the Republican measure would supersede state and local laws concerning the carry of concealed weapons in school zones. But a close reading of the interplay between the House-passed bill and state gun laws shows that’s not the case. The Gun-Free School Zones Act Before discussing what Boyle gets wrong, it’s worth noting that his claim would have been more accurate if he’d taken aim at federal law, not state law. The federal Gun-Free School Zones Act generally prohibits concealed carry in a school zone, which is defined as a distance of 1,000 feet from the grounds of a public, parochial or private school. But the law makes an exception for people who hold a concealed carry permit from the state in which the school zone is located, according to David Kopel, a policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. So under the Gun-Free School Zones Act, a permit issued by State A would allow you to legally carry in a school zone located in State A, but not a school zone in State B, Kopel said. But the bill the House voted on says that people with concealed-carry permits aren’t subject to the restrictions in the Gun-Free School Zones Act. In other words, Kopel said, if you had a permit from State A, and carried a gun into a school zone in State B, you would face no penalty under the Gun-Free School Zones Act. So Boyle would have been accurate to say the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act overrides federal law concerning the carry of concealed weapons in a school zone. But his claim was about state and local laws. Bill does not supersede state law Boyle specifically said the bill would allow residents of one of the dozen states that allow permitless concealed carry to "walk right into a school zone with a loaded weapon, no matter what local laws say." A large majority of states prohibit non-school employees from carrying in schools, even with a concealed carry permit. So if Boyle were correct, the House bill would stand to cancel out a great deal of gun regulation at the state level. But the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act clearly states that it does not supersede state law — the opposite of Boyle's claim. Under the bill, permit-holders would still be subject to any state or local laws that restrict the carry of a gun in a school or a designated zone around it. The bill reads: "This section shall not be construed to supersede or limit the laws of any state that permit private persons or entities to prohibit or restrict the possession of concealed firearms on their property, or prohibit or restrict the possession of firearms on any state or local government property, installation, building, base, or park." So if the bill becomes law, states would still be free to ban the carry of guns in school zones — and the federal law would also yield to any future laws passed by the minority of states that now generally allow concealed-carry permit holders to carry in schools. "That’s precisely the opposite of Boyle’s point, which was local laws are irrelevant," said Adam Winkler, law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. Joseph Blocher, a law professor at Duke University who specializes in federal and state constitutional law, agreed that Boyle’s statement is misleading. "If the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act passes, someone from a permitless state could walk into a school zone without violating any federal law, since HR 38 basically rescinds the Gun Free School Zones Act," he said. "But the part about ‘no matter what local laws say’ isn’t right." Our ruling Boyle said the concealed carry bill would allow residents of certain states to "travel to your community and walk right into a school zone with a loaded weapon, no matter what local laws say." While the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act would override a federal law concerning the carry of concealed weapons in a school zone, Boyle is wrong about how the bill would affect state and local gun laws. Concealed carry permit-holders — and residents of the dozen states that allow permitless concealed carry — would still be subject to any state or local laws that prohibit or restrict the carry of a gun in a school or a designated zone around it.

pomt-05092	"New Jersey's citizens are working at the highest rate in three years."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jul/01/jennifer-beck/ennifer-beck-claims-new-jersey-residents-are-worki/	Legislators armed themselves with job statistics before dueling over tax cut proposals in the state budget last week. Some Democrats argued that the responsible course of action was delaying any tax cuts considering the state’s high unemployment rate. Gov. Chris Christie wanted a 10 percent income tax cut. Democrats had offered two plans focused on reducing the property tax burden but passed a budget that tied any tax cut to the state meeting Christie’s revenue projections. State Sen. Jennifer Beck, a Republican from Monmouth County, pointed to other labor data to show New Jersey’s economy is starting to recover. "New Jersey's citizens are working at the highest rate in three years. That's good news," she said in her June 25 speech on the state Senate floor. "We have more businesses expanding their footprint in this state. We've seen almost $8 billion in public-private investment over the last two and a half years. All of those are good signs and today in delivering this budget without a tax cut I think we’re giving a kick in the shins to our citizens because we have the revenue now to be able to deliver that relief and it should be our foremost and top priority." PolitiFact New Jersey checked Beck’s claim that residents are "working at the highest rate in three years." Beck cited labor data showing that roughly 4.17 million New Jersey residents were employed in May. "The last time that New Jersey had this many people employed was in February of 2009, more than 3 years ago," Beck said in an e-mail. PolitiFact New Jersey confirmed that’s accurate. But raw numbers are not a rate. Joseph Seneca, a professor at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, agreed that the number of New Jerseyans working is the highest in three years, but said "the confusion would be the word rate." "Usually a rate is expressed per unit of something," Seneca said, as in per thousand or per unit of time. And when comparing the number of employed people to the labor force, the statistics tell a different story. The employment rate is essentially the opposite of the unemployment rate. The unemployment rate is calculated by taking the number of people who are unemployed but looking for work and dividing it by the labor force. The labor force includes employed people and people who are unemployed but looking for work. People who are unemployed but aren’t looking for work are not included in the labor force. New Jersey’s unemployment rate -- and therefore the employment rate -- has fluctuated some in the past three years, but overall has remained relatively even. In May of 2009 the unemployment rate was 8.9 percent and the employment rate was about 91 percent. Since then both rates have varied, but in May of this year, the unemployment rate was 9.2 percent and the employment rate was 90.8 percent. So, as a rate, fewer New Jerseyans are working now than three years ago. In response, Beck pointed to the rate of employment compared to the total state population, but that includes individuals who are younger than 16, as well as people who are institutionalized and active duty service members. Excluding those groups of individuals, as the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics does, about 61.4 percent of New Jersey’s population was employed in May 2009. In May 2012, roughly 60 percent of the population was employed. "What is unassailably true is that the employment level is the highest in 3 years. It is my belief that New Jersey is moving in the right direction," Beck said. Our ruling Beck said that "New Jersey's citizens are working at the highest rate in three years." To support her claim, Beck pointed to the number of employed residents, which is at the highest level since more than three years ago. But Beck said rate and the percent of employed residents ticked down slightly from May 2009 to May 2012. We rate this statement False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-11275	"I am still waiting for someone to produce pieces of the alleged plane" that caused the Twin Towers to collapse.	pants on fire!	/north-carolina/statements/2018/apr/25/lawana-mayfield/charlotte-city-councilor-pieces-911-planes-havent-/	Never mind that TV stations aired live footage of a plane striking the World Trade Center on 9/11. Or that there are thousands of witnesses who also saw the planes strike the Twin Towers. Or that Osama Bin Laden took credit for the attack. LaWana Mayfield, a Democratic Charlotte city councilwoman, is apparently unconvinced that planes struck the towers and caused them to collapse. In fact, she’s skeptical that pieces of the plane exist at all. On Facebook, Mayfield recently posted a link to an obscure website promoting the idea that the towers in New York City may have fallen on Sept. 11, 2001, for some reason other than being struck by airplanes. "I am still waiting for someone to produce pieces of the alleged plane that opened the doors for US Citizens to loose all privacy rights (from the conspiracy theorist in me)," she posted. Mayfield later apologized for posting comments that caused "hurt and pain," but has declined to acknowledge that planes were responsible for the collapse of the Twin Towers. She appeared on the WCNC show "Flashpoint" to discuss the post. When asked directly about the post – "Do you believe the planes took down those towers?" – Mayfield dodged the question. "What I believe is that we lost Americans during this event. What I believe is that after this event, our nation identified a segment of our community and said this community is now terrorists. And from that moment, we have been saying 'terrorists, terrorists, terrorists,' " Mayfield said. But, she added, "white Americans who have committed mass killings since that time" were not called "terrorists." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com It’s unclear what, exactly, Mayfield believes happened on 9/11. She didn’t respond to an email seeking comment. When reached by phone Wednesday, Mayfield said the email likely went into a folder she created for 9/11-related emails and that she hadn’t seen it. She then declined to comment on her Facebook post, saying she was walking into a meeting. The "three-day news cycle" has passed, Mayfield said, adding "I’m trying to tackle this housing crisis." It is clear, however, that planes hit the Twin Towers and caused them to collapse. Let’s break this down as simply as possible. The plane There are eyewitnesses who saw the planes hit the towers. News cameras also captured footage of the second plane hitting the south tower. Large pieces of the airplanes were found around Ground Zero, as documented by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in 2002. A piece – part of a plane wing – was found nearby in 2013. CNN uploaded video of the wing removal. A fragment of one of the planes is on display at the 9/11 Memorial and Museum in New York. Researchers at Popular Mechanics Magazine published a book debunking theories that the planes weren’t actually planes, but missiles or something else. The collapse Conspiracy theorists have argued that jet fuel can’t melt steel beams, so the Twin Towers couldn’t have fallen over due to the impact of a plane alone. But the fuel doesn’t need to melt the beams in order to damage their structural integrity. Furthermore, the World Trade Center was built with a load-bearing core in its center (as opposed to concrete columns). But that center, the Washington Post pointed out, was surrounded by a "thin exterior shell — a density of eight to nine pounds per cubic foot. That’s lighter than balsa wood." The Facebook post Mayfield paired her comments about 9/11 with a link to an obscure website, AwarenessAct.com. The site boasts about a feature in the July-August 2016 issue of Europhysics News magazine examining the likelihood that the Twin Towers collapsed as a result of a controlled demolition. According to fact-checking website Snopes.com, the article was written by "a group of scientists who have long been involved with the promotion of 9/11 conspiracy theories." EDP Sciences, which produces Europhysics News, later released a statement on Twitter that downplayed the scientific legitimacy of the article. "EDP Sciences follows the most rigorous peer review standards for its journals of which [Europhysics News] is not one," the statement reads. "As a magazine, the editorial policy of EPN is to publish news and views, which are sometimes controversial. EDP Sciences recognizes that the article discusses some speculative and controversial issues," the statement continues. "However EPN and EDP Sciences believe that the best (and the most scientific) way to settle such issues is to publish them and have an open discussion with all due arguments in which the truth will finally emerge." Our ruling Mayfield described the planes that hit the World Trade Center on 9/11 as "alleged" planes and said pieces of the planes had yet to be revealed to the public. Eyewitness accounts, video, plane debris and most credible science points to the fact that airplanes struck the Twin Towers on Sept. 11, 2001, causing them to collapse.

pomt-02976	"Half of all CEOs say that the shutdown and the threat of shutdown set back their plans to hire over the next six months."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/21/barack-obama/half-all-ceos-say-shutdown-hiring-setback-six-mont/	After a Senate deal brought the 16-day government shutdown to a close, President Barack Obama wanted to make sure the impact of narrowly avoiding a default wasn’t lost on the nation. "These last few weeks have inflicted completely unnecessary damage on our economy," he said in a public address Thursday. As proof, he offered up specific claims including, "Half of all CEOs say that the shutdown and the threat of shutdown set back their plans to hire over the next six months." PolitiFact wanted to know whether Obama’s CEO statistic was accurate. The White House pointed us to a recent Business Roundtable survey. "Fifty percent of responding CEOs indicated that the ongoing disagreement in Washington over the 2014 budget and the debt ceiling is having a negative impact on their plans for hiring additional employees over the next six months," the report reads. On its face, that’s in line with what Obama said, but we wanted to see how Business Roundtable acquired their results. They would not disclose their exact question wording to us. Their report notes, "Responses were received from 134 member CEOs, 63 percent of the total Business Roundtable membership." Business Roundtable’s membership tends to be larger companies. Spokeswoman Amanda DeBard told us CEOs are invited based on revenue, industry and market capitalization, so it’s safe to say the poll responses don’t reflect a random sample of U.S. businesses. Since Obama often speaks to the Business Roundtable, we wanted to see what his relationship with the group was like. University of Kansas political science professor Burdett Loomis, who specializes in lobbying, said there’s not much of a connection. "Many of them have long-term relationships with government (simply because of their size and the government’s size), but probably only a handful have any kind of even semi-close relationship with Obama," he said. We ran the poll results by another business group, the National Federation of Independent Businesses. Senior policy analyst Holly Wade said she saw a similar sentiment among the smaller business owners that the federation represents. "In September, there were more small business owners that were feeling pessimistic about business conditions six months out," she said. There wasn’t much opinion voiced about delaying employment specifically, though. But Wade said that could be because small businesses were already hiring less during the economic recovery compared to bigger corporations. Why would CEOs want to delay hiring? With another possible debt ceiling default looming Feb. 7, University of Maryland finance professor David Kass said it’s likely that a budget deal will lead to tighter fiscal policy, which would slow down the economy and cause CEOs to put off hiring decisions for a few months. Another factor that would contribute to CEO anxiety is consumer behavior. While day-to-day spending probably won’t change post-shutdown, consumers will likely postpone higher ticket purchases, like homes and cars. "On the demand side, there’s uncertainty on the consumers’ part, which in turn will have an impact on CEOs," Kass said. "They’re trying to predict their future sales and what the environment will look like. It’s a lose-lose situation for everyone." In any case, Obama is trying to communicate that the shutdown had a significant financial impact on the nation, and he’s not wrong there. Independent forecasts agree that the shutdown was a setback for the U.S. economy, though they differ on exact figures. Our ruling Obama said 50 percent of CEOs are delaying hiring due to the shutdown, which accurately cites the results of a poll sponsored by the Business Roundtable. The survey’s limited sampling, though, means the responses aren’t necessarily representative of all U.S. businesses. But the idea that the shutdown affects how businesses think about hiring is more broadly applicable. Experts said it’s reasonable that CEOs would be hesitant to hire, given that uncertainty about government fiscal policy can affect consumer confidence.

pomt-06380	Says Measure 3-386 will cost a fortune for elections while Measure 3-388 will cost less.	false	/oregon/statements/2011/nov/02/ann-lininger/will-countywide-vote-urban-renewal-cost-taxpayers-/	Voters love to save money. They also probably don’t want to spend "a fortune" on unnecessary elections. These are precisely the points being made by supporters of a Clackamas County board-backed measure on the Nov. 8 ballot. A campaign mailer in favor of Measure 3-388 urges voters to say no to county Measure 3-386, a competing proposal that would require a county-wide vote on future urban renewal project areas. "There are two measures on the ballot having to do with Urban Renewal. In one way they are the same: both require a vote of the people before any Urban Renewal Area can be established in unincorporated Clackamas County. But there are two very important differences:" The mailer says that 3-386 "Costs MORE money. An Urban Renewal Area affecting only a few hundred people would trigger a county-wide election covering over 200,000 voters, costing taxpayers a fortune." The mailer also urges a yes vote on Measure 3-388, which would require approval from a smaller number of voters who live in a proposed urban renewal district. This is the proposal backed by the Clackamas County Board of County Commissioners. The mailer says this measure "Costs LESS money. Smaller election = less cost." You guessed our burning question: Does the county-wide measure cost "a fortune" while smaller elections cost less? (A similar mailer went out just this week.) Measure 3-386 was put on the ballot by citizen petitioners who don’t like the county board approving new urban renewal areas without a county vote. If this measure passes, any new plan or substantial change to an existing plan would need to be approved by a majority of county voters in a primary or general election. In other words, commissioners would have two opportunities every two years. The competing measure put forth by the county board, Measure 3-388, would send the issue only to voters who live in a proposed or existing district. So there would be fewer voters voting, but this election could happen during one of four authorized elections a year. That’s eight opportunities every two years. At first blush, it sounds as if a countywide election would be just as cost effective. After all, how much could it cost to add a question to a general or primary election ballot that needs to go out anyway so people can vote on federal and state offices? County elections manager Steve Kindred says that an urban renewal question on a general election ballot wouldn’t cost more if it goes to more voters. The ballots would be the same size whether the question goes to 200,000 voters or 1,000 voters. The Voters’ Pamphlet is not zoned. Turnout would be high anyway in a general election so the issue probably wouldn’t boost processing costs. On the other hand, an off-year election strictly for an urban renewal question, no matter how small the voting pool, could cost an extra $10,000. We contacted Ann Lininger, a Clackamas County commissioner serving as one of the point people on the more limited proposal. She said the county-wide measure would cost more because it would require more notice and explanation to more voters who live in disparate parts of the county. There is a requirement in the county-wide measure that the county send notice to voters before an election. The notice must explain that there is an urban renewal measure on the ballot; that it would take away from other public services for x number of years; that the maximum amount of indebtedness would be x dollars; and that the maximum amount of interest would be x amount. The measure allows the county to include that information in the 500-word explanatory statement required by state law. But Lininger said that option is not feasible, given the complexity of a development plan and the need to make sure voters understand the issue. So the county would have to spend at least $45,000 on mailers, she said, and more on staff time for public meetings. "You would want to have the opportunity to make a case in the explanatory statement," she said. But Beaverton officials had no problem including that same information in their Voters’ Pamphlet statement for Measure 34-192, which proposes a new urban renewal area. Eric Winters, the attorney who drafted the citizen-approved measure in Clackamas County, said the Beaverton explanatory statement pretty much meets his test. And there was room to explain the plan. Measure 3-386 may very well cost more than 3-388 in the end, if you factor in all the time and resources commissioners and staff would need to promote an urban renewal measure or make a significant change to one. But that’s campaigning, not just providing basic information or holding an election. The statement in the mailer zeroes in on election costs. We find that the proponents of the smaller election option have not proved their case that their version would cost less or that a countywide election would cost a fortune. In fact, special elections could cost more. The statement is not accurate. We rate it False. Return to OregonLive to comment on this ruling.

pomt-06973	"State agencies have not identified one single instance where groundwater has been damaged due to hydraulic fracking."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/jul/14/kris-jordan/state-sen-kris-jordan-says-fracking-hasnt-contamin/	As public debate across the country has bubbled up in recent months over environmental concerns related to hydraulic fracturing — or fracking as it’s becoming widely known — proponents of oil and gas drilling have come rushing to its defense. The process involves pumping millions of gallons chemical-laced water and sand deep underground into horizontal wells under high pressure to crack open shale, enabling natural gas extraction. On June 15, 2011, state Sen. Kris Jordan, a Delaware Republican, defended the process in a floor speech on behalf of legislation that would throw open state parkland to oil and gas drilling. During his speech, Jordan portrayed the growing concerns of the public — which have been fanned by "Gasland," a controversial documentary on the environmental issues related to the fracking process — as overblown as he pointed to a long track record of safe fracking in Ohio. "State agencies have not identified one single instance where groundwater has been damaged due to hydraulic fracking," Jordan said. With drilling likely coming soon to Eastern Ohio where the Utica and Marcellus shale formations await possible exploration, PolitiFact Ohio decided to check out Jordan’s claim. We started with Jordan, who stood by his statement. "From what I understand, none of the cases has come from fracking itself being involved in contaminating any water," said Jordan. "Any problems that have happened have been well construction issues." Jordan said he consulted with several people in Ohio’s oil and gas industry including Tom Stewart, a top official with the Ohio Oil and Gas Association for his information. Stewart and other oil and gas supporters directed us to several recent statements from state and federal EPA officials such as one made recently by Lisa Jackson, President Barack Obama’s top federal Environmental Protection Agency administrator. During a House committee hearing, Jackson said evidence was limited on whether hydraulic fracturing can affect water tables and aquifers. "There is evidence it can certainly affect them. I am not aware of any proven case where the fracking process itself impacted water although there are investigations ongoing," she told lawmakers. The U.S. EPA began a study in January 2011 of possible environmental problems caused by fracking. The first findings from that study aren’t expected until late 2012. ODNR officials also said they haven’t seen water contamination from fracking in Ohio. "ODNR’s Oil and Gas Program has not identified any instances of groundwater contamination related to hydraulic fracturing since the technology was first used here in the early 1950s," ODNR spokeswoman Heidi Hetzel-Evans said in an email. When considering these statements, however, it’s important to understand exactly what they are saying—and also what they are not saying. What they are saying is that there are no documented cases of groundwater contamination directly from the process of pumping the chemical-laced water and sand into the ground to break the rock apart. They are not talking about the actual drilling of the hole that is fracked or the construction of the drilling well that is used for the fracking process. "There is definitely a lot of misinformation out there," said Hetzel-Evans. "I don’t think the general public understands that the drilling process isn’t fracking." And while there aren’t any groundwater problems due directly to fracking in Ohio, the drilling of wells to prepare for the fracking process has lead to water contamination in at least one case in Ohio. Meanwhile, the first study of its kind in the country is turning up similar evidence. In December 2007, a home exploded in a residential neighborhood in Bainbridge Township in Geauga County, Ohio. A panel assembled by ODNR ultimately found that a poorly-constructed well casing — think of it as a cement seal around the drill hole -- allowed gas to migrate upwards along the edge of the casing and up the pipe. Ultimately, this gas seeped into the home in Bainbridge and caused the explosion. Meanwhile, there is new evidence outside of Ohio that poorly constructed drilling wells used for fracking are leading to problems with groundwater. Duke University researchers found that methane levels were 17 times higher in water wells within one kilometer of hydraulic fracking sites in New York and Pennsylvania than in water wells farther away. The methane levels in those wells showed the same characteristics as methane produced from fracking, as opposed to naturally-occurring methane. Robert Jackson, the professor of environmental sciences who headed up the research, said that the "methane migration" was likely caused by problems with the casing around the drill hole rather than from the methane migrating thousands of feet through the rock from the fracking zone. But he wonders whether the new high-pressure water treatment used in fracking could be the cause. "What I haven’t seen anyone address is whether hydraulic fracturing makes it more likely to cause well casings to leak," he said. "It may be the high pressure involved in fracking makes leaks more common and bigger." Meanwhile, the gas exploration boom in Pennsylvania has begun turning up evidence that the shale gas exploration involving the fracking process could be contaminating groundwater supplies with methane. The state’s Department of Environmental Protection ordered Houston-based Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. to provide and maintain potable water and gas mitigation for residents in Dimock, Pa., who sued over wells polluted in 2009 with methane gas and other contaminants. Another group, from Lenox Township, Pa., sued Houston-driller Southwestern Energy Co. in 2010 claiming their wells were contaminated with fracking fluids. Both suits are tied up in court. So where does that leave Jordan’s claim that "state agencies have not identified one single instance where groundwater has been damaged due to hydraulic fracking." That statement squares with ODNR’s records. But regulators in Ohio have linked water contamination problems in at least one incident to other aspects of drilling such as the construction of the drilling wells. That’s additional information that provides clarification. On the Truth-O-Meter, Jordan’s statement grades out at Mostly True.	None	Kris Jordan	None	None	None	2011-07-14T06:00:00	2011-06-15	['None']
pomt-11459	"Since 1990, production of metals in the U.S. has held roughly constant, but the number of people employed in the industry has fallen steadily."	true	/punditfact/statements/2018/mar/08/noah-smith/has-automation-driven-job-losses-steel-industry/	As President Donald Trump weighed imposing tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum, some commentators have warned that this would be a misguided approach. Noah Smith, a columnist for Bloomberg View and a former finance professor, wrote a column in which he noted, among other things, that a crucial issue facing metals-producing industries isn’t foreign competition — it’s automation. Tariffs, Smith wrote, won’t "bring back good jobs at steel and aluminum factories. Since 1990, production of metals in the U.S. has held roughly constant, but the number of people employed in the industry has fallen steadily." That’s due to technological improvements, he wrote: "Productivity has improved, even as demand has stayed more or less constant. Mathematically, that means fewer jobs for steel and aluminum workers. Tariffs won’t change that equation. If anything, by hurting downstream industries like car and equipment manufacturers, the new import taxes will probably kill more factory jobs than they save." We can’t predict what will happen in the future, but we wondered whether Smith is right about the trend lines for production and employment in the American metals-producing sector since 1990. And when we took a closer look, we found that he’s on target. We found data for employment in the primary metals-producing sector, which incorporates five subcategories: iron and steel mills, steel product manufacturing from purchased steel, aluminum production and processing, production and processing of metals other than iron and aluminum, and foundries. Employment levels in this sector have declined reasonably steadily since 1990, despite a period of stable employment during the late 1990s, a sharp but temporary fall during the Great Recession, and a modest uptick over the past year or two in which metals employment growth has outpaced that of the overall economy, said Jed Kolko, chief economist at the jobs site Indeed.com. Overall, since 1990, employment has declined by about 42 percent. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com At the same time, production in primary metals has remained roughly the same since 1990 except for the Great Recession. For most of that period, production has ranged between 90 percent and 110 percent of the benchmark level (the amount produced in 2012): See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com If you put these two statistics together, the overall pattern becomes clear: As production stays roughly the same and as fewer workers make it happen, productivity rises over time. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com The idea that steel in particular has experienced a productivity revolution due to technology "is the same story I have been telling since the early 1990s," said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. "The basic story is that one person can produce a lot more metal today than he or she could produce" a few decades ago. Burtless said he has a brother who’s been working in the coke oven of a steel plant since the mid 1970s and who has "seen first-hand the dramatic reduction in person-power needed to keep integrated steel mills running at full capacity" — as well as improvements in quality. Michael J. Hicks, the director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Ball State University, agreed that Smith’s analysis is on target. "I would agree that the most likely cause of the productivity gains are technology, though I would interpret technology broadly to include not just machinery but the way that factories organize production, such as internal logistics and the reduction of redundant operations that might be enabled by technology," Hicks said. And J. Bradford Jensen, a professor of international business at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business, added that "imports did have something to do with the loss of employment in steel and aluminum, but the more important factor is technological change and productivity growth," he said. "Tariffs won't change that, much like relaxing regulations on coal and pollution will not bring back many coal-mining jobs," he said. Our ruling Smith wrote, "Since 1990, production of metals in the U.S. has held roughly constant, but the number of people employed in the industry has fallen steadily." His numbers are solid, and experts agree that automation has done significant harm to employment levels in the metal industry. We rate the statement True.

pomt-13980	Says Bernie Sanders "wins California landslide, But ⅔ of his votes aren’t counted."	pants on fire!	/california/statements/2016/jun/10/blog-posting/pants-fire-viral-rumor-bernie-sanders-won-californ/	Polls showed Californians ‘Feeling the Bern,’ shortly before the state’s June 7 primary. Bernie Sanders had pulled even or surged slightly ahead of Hillary Clinton in the Democratic presidential race after barnstorming from Chico to Chula Vista. But early results on Election Day showed Clinton crushing Sanders by more than 20 percentage points. That gap closed steadily as officials tallied more votes (to 12.6 points as of midafternoon June 10, 2016), but remained large enough for media outlets and professional pollsters to declare Clinton the winner. Still, there are those who point to millions of uncounted ballots in the state, and say Sanders was robbed. Justice Gazette, a group that describes itself as a counter to traditional media, is one of them. "Bernie Sanders Wins California Landslide But ⅔ of his Votes Aren’t Counted," the Justice Gazette wrote in an eye-popping headline on June 7. The article added: "In view of the information from polling place workers about Sanders winning by more than a 2 to 1 margin and in view of the removal of 2/3 or more of his votes from the official results, the Justice Gazette declares Bernie Sanders the landslide winner of the 2016 California Primary Election." The Gazette article has been shared widely on Facebook and shows up prominently on web searches about Bernie Sanders and the California primary. Screen shot of Justice Gazette June 7, 2016 headline and article There’s no doubt Sanders ran a strong race in California. But the Gazette’s claim seemed outlandish and ripe for a fact check. Our research Three days after the election, Clinton had more than 2 million votes to Sanders’ nearly 1.6 million, for a lead of about 450,000 votes, according to the California Secretary of State’s website. If there’s any landslide victory, at this point, it’s by Clinton. Of course, the results are not official, as nearly 2.6 million ballots remained unprocessed as of Thursday, June 9, also according to the California Secretary of State. Most are expected to include votes in the Democratic presidential primary. Reports surfaced on Election Day about broken voting machines, incomplete voter rolls and confusion among unaffiliated voters over how to obtain a Democratic ballot. Many voters received provisional ballots that were not immediately counted. Once they are, pollsters expect the gap to narrow, but not close. Mark DiCamillo, director of the Field Poll, told PolitiFact California he does not think Clinton’s lead is in jeopardy. Clinton’s lead "might go down into the single digits, but it’s still going to be a Clinton win," DiCamillo said. The Field Poll surveyed voters who had yet to cast ballots shortly before Election Day and found Sanders had the edge, but only by one percentage point. DiCamillo estimated Sanders would have to win the remaining votes by roughly a 2 to 1 margin to overtake Clinton. "You’re smoking something if you think that’s going to happen," he added. Of the Justice Gazette claim of two-thirds of Sanders’ votes being uncounted, DiCamillo said "nobody can claim to know that." Neither during his speech in Santa Monica on election night, nor since, has Sanders protested the California results. A representative for the Sanders campaign said it had no affiliation with the Justice Gazette story. "No one’s questioning the fundamental integrity of the election," Ben Tulchin, Sanders’ national pollster, told PolitiFact California, in an interview on June 10, 2016. Tulchin added that the campaign believes California can do more to make it easier for independents to vote in a Democratic primary. The Sanders pollster said the campaign expects the California "race to close substantially," perhaps "to low single digits," once all the votes are counted. As for overtaking Clinton’s lead, Tulchin said "there’s a small chance. But it would be highly unlikely." A representative for the Gazette could not be reached. Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., speaks at a rally Tuesday, June 7, 2016, in Santa Monica, Calif. (AP Photo/John Locher) Our ruling After early California primary results showed a big Clinton lead over Sanders, the Justice Gazette posted the headline on June 7: "Bernie Sanders Wins California But ⅔ of his Votes Aren’t Counted." Three days later, Clinton continues to lead Sanders by about 450,000. There are more than two million uncounted votes. But based on polling shortly before the race, showing Sanders even or slightly ahead with voters who had yet to cast ballots, professional pollsters and news outlets say Clinton’s lead could shrink somewhat but is not in danger. Sanders would have to win the remaining votes by a huge margin, something no polls showed in advance of Election Day. There is evidence that California’s complicated voting rules led to problems. That may have prevented some Sanders supporters from voting for him and, for that matter, some Clinton supporters from voting for her. But there’s no proof to back up the outlandish claim that Sanders won California or that two-thirds of his votes were not counted. We rate the Gazette’s claim Pants On Fire.

pomt-04142	"The problem with raising tax rates on the wealthiest Americans is that more than half of them are small business owners."	false	/ohio/statements/2013/jan/03/john-boehner/john-boehner-says-half-wealthiest-americans-are-sm/	As President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner dickered over how to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff, the issue of who might pay more in taxes was a persistent stumbling block. The White House said there could be no deficit deal unless Republicans agree to raise tax rates on the wealthiest households and proposed increasing rates on incomes greater than $250,000 a year for married couples ($200,000 for individuals). Republicans wanted to focus the talks on spending and entitlements. Ultimately a deal brokered by Vice President Joe Biden and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, was approved. It allowed rates to rise on incomes above $450,000 for married couples. But during the negotiating, Boehner balked at increasing the maximum 35 percent tax rate on high-income taxpayers at all because of the effects for small business. "The problem with raising tax rates on the wealthiest Americans is that more than half of them are small business owners," Boehner said in a news conference. "Raising tax rates will slow down our ability to create the jobs that everyone says they want." PolitiFact has examined a similar claim Boehner made about small business owners before, and rated it False. FactCheck.org also has looked at the issue, calling it "an incorrect talking point" and a "bogus claim." But we wondered about current figures behind the claim, and several readers asked about its accuracy. We asked Boehner's office how he backed up the statement. His staff said the tax increases would hit half of all small business income, and they pointed us to a January 2012 report from the President’s Council on Jobs and Competitiveness. The council's report states: "About half of business income now accrues to pass-through entities such as S corporations and partnerships; although the income of such pass-through entities is subject to tax at the individual level, it is excluded from the corporate tax." In other words, Boehner's staff said, many small businesses file their taxes as individuals, not corporations, and 53 percent of all business income is taxed through the individual code. Boehner's staff also cited a report by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation in Congress which said the tax hikes would affect roughly 940,000 small business owners. It, too, found that 53 percent of business income would be reported on tax returns in the top brackets on which Obama would raise taxes. That does show that some small business owners would see taxes go up. But it falls short of supporting Boehner's statement. While the JCT report found that 53 percent of business income would be reported in the top two tax brackets, that is not at all the same as saying that half of the earners are being taxed at that rate. In fact, the JCT estimated that just 3.5 percent of taxpayers with business income in 2013 would fall in the tax brackets that would rise under Obama's proposal. And the JCT said its figures "do not imply that all of the income is from entities that might be considered 'small.' For example, in 2005, 12,862 S corporations and 6,658 partnerships had receipts of more than $50 million." S corporations and partnerships are "pass-through" businesses in which profits pass from the business to individual shareholders for tax purposes. They include sole proprietorships and such partnerships as big law firms and financial funds. Goldman Sachs was classified as a partnership before it went public in 1999. So what is a small business? The Office of Tax Analysis at the U.S. Treasury Department issued a study in 2011 that recognized the need for a clear definition. The authors acknowledge that defining a small business is a matter of setting some subjective parameters. The ones they set include a limit of $10 million in income or deductions to be counted as "small," and a minimum labor deduction of $10,000 to distinguish businesses that don’t have any employees. Other tests they applied excluded businesses on the very low end of the scale, such as those with $4,600 or less net annual income. They defined an "owner" as someone who gets at least one-fourth of income from a small business. Not surprisingly, by narrowing the definition, far fewer tax filers qualified as small businesses. The analysis found that: Only one-fifth of small businesses are employers, using their definition. Only 8 percent of small-business owners have income of $200,000 or more. So 92 percent of small-business owners wouldn’t have been affected by Obama’s proposal. Slightly more than half of small businesses reported total income of less than $50,000, and half of those businesses reported a tax loss for the year. Only 0.5 percent of small businesses reported a profit in excess of $1 million. For those businesses, investment and rental income comprised roughly half of their reported income. Of the taxpayers in the top two brackets that would be increased, only 11 percent reported any small-business income, and only 9 percent qualify as small business owners. Boehner's statement was: "The problem with raising tax rates on the wealthiest Americans is that more than half of them are small business owners." That is wrong on two points -- the "half" and the "small business owners." Of the business income reported on tax returns, half of it would have been taxed at the top two rates, the Joint Committee on Taxation found. But that doesn’t mean half of the earners are paying those rates. And it’s incorrect to call small business owners and millionaires who would see a tax increase one and the same. For top earners who report business income, it is often just a fraction of their total income. They are not the folks operating small manufacturing plants or neighborhood pizza parlors. In fact, only 0.5 percent of small businesses make that kind of money. More often, small businesses are small in every sense -- most have incomes of less than $50,000 and almost all have profits of less than $1 million -- and they wouldn’t be affected by the millionaires tax. Boehner’s statement is not accurate. On the Truth-O-Meter, his claim rates False.	None	John Boehner	None	None	None	2013-01-03T06:00:00	2012-11-09	['United_States']
pomt-10256	McCain "still thinks it's okay when women don't earn equal pay for equal work."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/27/hillary-clinton/no-hes-just-not-okay-with-one-bill/	Democrats continue trying to drive a wedge between the Republican presidential candidate and female voters, and the equal-pay issue continues to be a theme. The party's most prominent woman, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, took her turn during her much-anticipated convention speech. Sen. John McCain, she said, "still thinks it's okay when women don't earn equal pay for equal work." That's flatly contradicted by statements McCain has made. On April 23 he said he is "all in favor of pay equity for women," then said in July, "I'm committed to making sure that there's equal pay for equal work." So how can Clinton argue the opposite? The answer lies in a Senate vote earlier this year on an issue involving Lilly Ledbetter, a former manager at a Goodyear Tire and Rubber plant in Alabama. Ledbetter discovered that she was being paid less than her male counterparts and sued for discrimination. The case reached the U.S. Supreme Court in 2007, and Ledbetter lost. The majority said a 180-day statute of limitations in the law had started from the first instance of discrimination, meaning that her suit about more than a decade of discrimination was untimely. Ledbetter became a folk heroine among Democrats (and spoke at the Democratic National Convention). Democrats in Congress responded quickly to the Supreme Court decision, putting together a bill that would allow employers to be sued for every paycheck stemming from a discriminatory pay system, not the discriminatory decision itself. The bill passed the House, and Senate Democrats tried to schedule a vote to pass it there, too. Under Senate rules, 60 votes were needed to consider the bill, and just 56 voted yes on April 23. Barack Obama, Joe Biden and Clinton all voted yes. McCain missed the vote, which was not unusual during his presidential campaign. He later said he would have voted no. McCain was pressed further on the issue – by a 14-year-old girl who quizzed him at a town hall meeting a few weeks later. Here's what McCain said then: "I don't believe that this would do anything to help the rights of women except maybe help trial lawyers and others in that profession." It's a stretch for Clinton to argue that McCain thinks it's acceptable for women not to get equal pay for equal work, when McCain has said the exact opposite. He doesn't support a specific piece of legislation that could make wage-discrimination suits more painful to employers. It's an important bill, it's the most significant equal-pay issue under consideration right now and there's probably a fair way to phrase this attack and make it stick. But opposing that bill is not the same as thinking it's okay if women don't get equal pay for equal work, so we rate the claim False.

pomt-04748	"A Gallup report recently said that nearly 50 percent of small business owners aren't hiring because of what they call ‘regulatory uncertainty.’"	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/29/sher-valenzuela/sher-valenzuela-says-regulation-big-factor-holding/	At the Republican National Convention, the GOP candidate for lieutenant governor of Delaware picked up a frequent complaint of Republicans -- that government regulation is hampering hiring by businesses, particularly small businesses. "A Gallup report recently said that nearly 50 percent of small business owners aren't hiring because of what they call ‘regulatory uncertainty," Valenzuela said. We wondered whether that was correct. We found a survey conducted by Gallup in January 2012 that addresses this point -- the Wells Fargo Small Business Survey, which interviewed 600 small business owners by phone. It has a sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. Valenzuela can find some support for her comment in the poll results. One of the questions asked was, "Why are you not looking for new employees? For each of the following, please indicate if it is a reason why you are not looking to hire." When offered the option, "Worried about new government regulations," 46 percent of business owners surveyed said yes. That’s fairly close to half. However, that leaves out some important context. For starters, 53 percent -- a majority -- said they did not consider government regulations to be a barrier to future hiring. At least as important, government regulation ranked pretty far down the list of factors offered. Of the eight factors suggested (not counting "other"), concern about government regulations ranked sixth. More popular answers were "don't need any additional employees at this time" (76 percent), "worried revenues or sales won't justify adding more employees" (71 percent), "worried about the current status of the U.S. economy" (66 percent), "worried about cash flow or ability to make payroll" (53 percent) and "worried about the potential cost of health care" (48 percent). In its analysis of the survey data, Gallup took a middle-of-the-road analysis. "The debate over why U.S. small-business owners aren't hiring more aggressively tends to hinge on whether overall business conditions, including a lack of growth and revenue, are the primary culprit as opposed to the potential cost of healthcare and government regulations," Gallup wrote. "Apparently, both sides of the debate are correct. "Small-business owners hire when they need to respond to increased business activity and have the opportunity to grow. Although some small businesses in selected industries and markets have been growing, the weak economy of the past four years has limited overall small-business growth. ... "Given this difficult operating environment, it is not surprising that many small-business owners also worry about potential new health care costs and government regulations. While small businesses are always finding ways to deal with their changing operating environment, including government regulations and health care, these added challenges can be seen as exacerbating an already uncertain and difficult situation. In turn, they become additional reasons to hold back on hiring." Our rating Valenzuela is close to correct when she says that "a Gallup report recently said nearly 50 percent of small businesses owners aren't hiring because of what they call ‘regulatory uncertainty.’" (It’s a bit short of 50 percent, and it was a survey from nine months ago.) However, this claim leaves out some important context. Five other factors ranked higher on a list of eight factors that might be impeding hiring. Essentially, Valenzuela cherry-picked one of the factors to make her point, which suggested that it was the only, or main, reason for the lack of hiring. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-00852	Says "Jeb Bush has released 10 percent of his emails."	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/mar/18/james-carville/jeb-bush-revealed-much-more-10-his-emails-governor/	Hillary Clinton might be in a bit of hot water for using a private email account for official business as secretary of state, but Democrats eagerly point to similar email issues with presumptive Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush. As governor of Florida, Bush burnished his tech and public access credentials by using a personal email account to supplement the one the state provided. Prior to Clinton’s troubles, Bush set up a special website for the public to browse any of those emails that dealt with official business. Like Clinton, Bush himself determined which ones were private and which would be made public, but the move was largely seen as a way to mark Bush as a candidate who walks the walk when it comes to transparency. This led Democratic activist James Carville to challenge how transparent Bush really is. "Jeb Bush has released 10 percent of his emails," Carville said on ABC’s This Week, March 15, 2015. "He had a private email server. He destroyed his emails." We decided to check Carville’s numbers. Carville’s assistant, Kees Nordin, gave PunditFact the underlying math. "The fact is that of Jeb Bush's 3 million emails (public and private) he's only released 275,000 or just under 10 percent," Nordin said. According to Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell, Bush posted nearly 280,000 emails from his personal email account on a website he set up, jebbushemails.com. Back in 2007, Bush gave an off-the-cuff estimate that during his eight years in office he received about 550,000 emails at his personal address jeb@jeb.org. We tried to confirm that number, but Campbell said "It’s immaterial as they are not subject to public records request and not required by law to be retained." In the same interview in 2007, Bush said an additional 2.5 million emails came through other email accounts run by the state. So this is how Carville gets to a grand total of 3 million emails. The question is, did Bush reveal just 275,000 -- or 280,000 -- of them? The answer is no, because most of them have been, and remain, publicly available. Under Florida law, most of Bush's emails to his government accounts are a public record and accessible to people who request them, said Barbara Petersen, president of Florida’s First Amendment Foundation. (The First Amendment Foundation advocates for government transparency and receives major support from foundations and Florida’s news organizations, including the Tampa Bay Times.) "Anything relating to public business is a public record in Florida," Petersen said. "If you comment on a policy, even if the rest of the email is personal, it will be subject to a public records request. It’s a fairly broad definition." Importantly, all of the emails sent to accounts run by the state would have been seen and vetted by state workers, not private staffers or lawyers employed by Bush. They remain the custodian of those records, and Petersen said she believes most of the Bush emails from his official accounts have been retained. The first stop for those emails would be the Citizen Services office, which fields all incoming communications to the governor. While some emails might be purely personal or otherwise exempt and would not be released, they were still part of the state’s public record. The point being, only the 550,000 emails sent to Bush’s personal account would have remained under his exclusive control. The rest remain housed with the state government. What's the point? We can confidently say that the 280,000 emails on the Bush website represent just a fraction of the total number of emails that are "public." While the precise figures are unclear, if 2.5 million emails went to one of the state-run email accounts then all of those were subject to a public records request. So in a rough sense, close to 90 percent of the universe of 3 million emails are public in some form. If you look at just Bush's private emails, about 50 percent are public. Neither number is close to the one Carville cited. We reached out to state officials to see if they can add any information about the number of official emails that are part of Bush's record. We will update this item if we learn further details. A few notes Carville said Bush had a private email server. According to press reports, Bush used a server located in the governor's office. He took the server with him when he left office. Carville also said Bush destroyed the emails he hadn’t revealed. We asked how he knew that and got no reply. Petersen had the same question and noted that Florida law presents a hurdle to destroying emails. "If you made a public record request of Jeb’s email and you thought you didn't get them all, you can file suit in civil court and request an in camera inspection by a judge," she said. Petersen said the state judges which records have archival value and which ones are trivial and can be disposed. Our ruling Carville said that Bush revealed 10 percent of his emails and he destroyed his emails. The numbers don’t add up. The numbers used by Carville himself include 2.5 million emails sent to state run accounts. Those emails are subject to a public records request. It is completely inaccurate to say that Bush only revealed 275,000 or 280,000 emails out of a total of 3 million. A more accurate reading would be that he revealed about half of the emails sent to his private account, and the rest were already available to the press, although some might be held back if they were strictly personal in nature. We rate the claim False.	None	James Carville	None	None	None	2015-03-18T17:53:10	2015-03-15	['Jeb_Bush']
pomt-03870	Florida is "second in the nation in the uninsured."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2013/mar/08/christopher-l-smith/chris-smith-says-florida-no-2-uninsured/	Florida Democratic Senate leader Chris Smith of Fort Lauderdale has found himself in unfamiliar territory lately: agreeing with Republican Gov. Rick Scott. "Medicaid expansion, Obamacare, teacher raises. Who is this guy?" Smith tweeted on Feb. 21 in response to Scott’s announcements that he would support Medicaid expansion and raises for teachers. Flash forward to March 5, when Scott gave his annual State of the State address. The former state budget slayer and foe of Obamacare gave a speech in which he called for helping the poor, the disabled and teachers. So how does a Democratic leader -- whose role is to attack the Republican Scott -- respond? By telling voters that while the Democrats believe Scott is now on the right track in some areas, the state still has far to go to help the middle class and the poor. Smith’s speech criticized Scott’s past education funding record and called for Scott to give state workers a raise, protect the environment and undo past changes to Florida elections law that contributed to long lines in November. Smith also called on Scott to work with the Legislature to ensure that it supports Medicaid expansion, despite opposition in the House. Scott announced his support for the expansion in February, but has said it isn’t one of his top priorities. Expanding Medicaid would give health care coverage to more of the poorest Floridians. Currently, the program is restricted to children, the elderly, the disabled and pregnant women. "We ask for you to provide true leadership, work with the Legislature and make sure that the House goes on with our Medicaid expansion. We are second in the nation in the uninsured. We need to make sure we expand Medicaid and use the federal dollars that will help our state budget," Smith said. Is Florida No. 2 in the nation for uninsured? Research ranking the number of uninsured We found there are a couple of different ways to account for the uninsured among the states. A spokeswoman for Smith cited an August 2012 article in the Huffington Post that ranked Florida at No. 2 in its share of uninsured residents based on 2010 U.S. Census data. Texas came in first with 26.3 percent, followed by Florida at 25.3 percent, and Nevada at 25.1 percent. The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation keeps track of state health facts and also draws on research from the U.S. Census Bureau. Kaiser examines state populations up to age 64, since people who are 65 and older can get Medicare. By that ranking, the states with the highest percentages of uninsured in 2010-11 were Texas (27 percent) followed by Nevada (25 percent). For third, Kaiser showed a tie between New Mexico and Florida, but Florida was a pinch higher at 24.18 percent compared with 23.85 percent for New Mexico. When looking at only the sheer number of uninsured under the age of 65, Florida was third place with 3.7 million, behind California (7.1 million) and Texas (6.1 million). Finally, the polling organization Gallup interviews residents nationwide about their insurance. A 2011 Gallup poll placed Florida in third for its percentage of uninsured, at 22.9 percent, behind Texas (27.6 percent) and Mississippi (23.5 percent). Why Florida’s rate is so high Smith’s claim about Florida’s high uninsured rate raises questions about why it is so high. John Rother, President and CEO, of the National Coalition on Health Care, which supports health care reform, sent us a list of seven reasons: • The state has many small and low-wage employers who do not offer insurance. • Florida has many seasonal workers who tend to be uninsured. • Florida attracts many pre-Medicare retirees who have lost their workplace coverage but are not yet old enough for Medicare. • Many with pre-existing conditions cannot get coverage. • South Florida is an especially high-cost area in terms of medical claims. • The state has relatively weak and underfunded safety net programs for the uninsured. • Immigrants have a particularly hard time obtaining insurance due to paperwork requirements. Our ruling Sen. Chris Smith said "We are second in nation in the uninsured." There are different ways to measure the uninsured. In terms of sheer numbers, Florida is third. We found the most useful measure is to count Floridians under the age of 65, which includes only those not eligible for Medicare. That measure shows the state in third place in the percentage of uninsured, after first place Texas and second place Nevada. Smith is slightly off on his numbers, but his point is on solid ground.

pomt-07912	Says there have been 50 million abortions since Roe v. Wade was decided.	true	/texas/statements/2011/feb/01/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-there-have-been-50-million-abortio/	Gov. Rick Perry marked the 38th anniversary of what he called "the tragedy" of the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark Roe v. Wade decision by speaking to fellow abortion opponents at the Jan. 22 Texas Rally for Life outside the Capitol building. Perry said that since the 1973 decision, which established abortion as a constitutional right, "50 million, 50 million children have lost their chances. That is a catastrophic number." PolitiFact Texas readers asked us to check Perry's statement. But before diving in, we noted two issues with Perry's use of "children" -- a flash point in the political, moral and scientific national debate over abortion. One, abortion rights supporters dispute calling unborn fetuses "children." Second, an unknown share of the 50 million aborted pregnancies referenced by Perry would not have resulted in live children, due to the natural risk of miscarriages and stillbirths. For our inquiry, we focused on the number of U.S. abortions since Roe was decided. The Roe v. Wade ruling, issued Jan. 22, 1973, struck down a Texas law prohibiting nearly all abortions and held that the right to privacy "is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy." It said states could not prohibit a woman from having an abortion before viability, the time at which a fetus can survive outside a woman's body. It noted that viability "is usually placed at about seven months (28 weeks) but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks." After fetal viability, the court said, states could limit abortions provided that their policies met certain requirements, including an exception to protect the life of the woman. Since then, other Supreme Court rulings have affirmed states' rights to approve further restrictions. During the early 1960s, every state except Pennsylvania allowed abortions when needed to protect a woman's life, according to a March 2003 article published by the universally respected Guttmacher Institute, which studies and advocates on issues related to reproductive health. At the time Roe was decided, 17 states allowed abortions in certain other situations such as when pregnancy was the result of rape or incest. In 1972, the year before the Roe ruling, about 587,000 legal abortions were reported to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to a 2005 CDC report. And since 1973? Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier pointed us to a January 2010 report from the National Right to Life Committee, a Washington-based group that opposes abortion, that says about 52 million abortions took place from 1973 through 2009. According to the report, the group arrived at the total using figures from the Guttmacher Institute for 1973 through 2005; estimating a number for the next four years; and finally adding 3 percent to account for under-reporting. The National Right to Life publication says 3 percent is the under-reporting rate estimated by Guttmacher. Using a similar methodology, National Right to Life has since updated its numbers. The new report says that more than 53 million abortions took place from 1973 through 2010. Rachel Jones, a senior research associate at Guttmacher, told us the institute doesn't adjust its numbers — which are estimates based on surveys of facilities where abortions are performed, including hospitals and clinics — for under-reporting. She said a 1994 Guttmacher study had found that some small facilities weren't included in the institute's survey, which indicated that the number of abortions in 1992 was actually 3 percent to 4 percent more than reported. Our attempts to reach officials at National Right to Life were unsuccessful. Next, we sought the most up-to-date abortion data from Guttmacher. Spokeswoman Rebecca Wind provided us with a 2011 report that includes annual data on abortions from 1973 through 2008. The total: 49.3 million. We also sought abortion numbers from other sources. Data from the CDC indicate that there were 37.8 million abortions from 1973 through 2006. However, according to the CDC's website, states are not required to report abortion information to the agency, so in some years, the numbers are incomplete. For example, the CDC's 2006 data do not include information on abortions in California, Louisiana or New Hampshire. Representatives of abortion rights organizations Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice Texas told us that the Guttmacher Institute is the best source for this information. Summing up: Perry's statement indicating that there have been 50 million abortions in the United States since 1973 appears to be on target. The Guttmacher Institute estimates that there were 49.3 million abortions in the U.S. through 2008 — 700,000 shy of 50 million. Considering that Guttmacher says there were more than 1 million abortions in both 2007 and 2008, it's reasonable to conclude that the United States has reached the 50 million mark. We rate Perry's statement True.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2011-02-01T06:00:00	2011-01-22	['None']
pomt-02641	San Antonio has seen "67% growth" in water customers "in the last 25 years, 0% more water used."	false	/texas/statements/2014/jan/17/robert-puente/san-antonio-water-customers-52-only-used-21-more-w/	San Antonio’s growth was coupled with an eye-popping statistic during the latest Texas Tribune Festival public policy conference. Robert Puente, CEO of the San Antonio Water System, said during a Sept. 20, 2013, panel discussion that the city-owned utility has seen "67 percent growth in the last 25 years, 0 percent more water used." San Antonio has been called a "poster child" for water conservation. As it has risen to become the seventh-largest city in the United States, its leadership has used multiple approaches to tackle the water worries facing all of Texas, where the population is rocketing and the future looks dry. But did 67 percent more customers settle in without using more water? By phone, Puente said the percentages he aired "need to be updated." The water system’s vice president for public affairs, Greg Flores, told us by email that Puente’s rates covered 1984 through 2009. During that period, according to a chart Flores sent us, the population served by the utility rose from 800,627 to 1.34 million while water produced fell from 191,431 acre-feet to 186,112 acre-feet (an acre-foot is the amount needed to cover an acre to a depth of 1 foot, equal to 325,851 gallons). That’s a nearly 68 percent increase in population served and a 2.9 percent decrease in water produced. Then again, the cited period wasn’t the latest 25-year time span when Puente spoke. Flores said the chart was generated from the utility’s 2008 statistics. Flores sent a web link to the most recent edition, the utility’s "2011 Stat Book," and gave us the numbers for 2012, which we used to check the six most recent 25-year spans for which data is available. The 2012 data was not available when Puente spoke at the conference, Flores said, though data through 2011 was. "Compilation of data for a particular year is typically not completed until the end of the following year," he said. The 25-year spans showed fluctuations partly explained by the weather: Flores noted that 2011 was "the single hottest, driest year in Texas" and said water use remained atypically high through the 2011-13 drought. 2007 was a very wet year for San Antonio, he said. 25-year span Population served Acre-feet used 1987-2012* Up 55.2% Up 23.4% 1986-2011 Up 51.8% Up 21% 1985-2010 Up 55.6% Up 5% 1984-2009 Up 57.6% Down 0.6% 1983-2008 Up 59.9% Up 21.5% 1982-2007 Up 69.1% Down 7.3% *2012 data were unavailable when Puente made his claim. The oldest span we checked, 1982-2007, showed more dramatic change than Puente’s statement: 69 percent growth and a 7 percent drop in water use. But the most recent span for which data was available when he spoke, 1986-2011, saw a 52 percent increase in customers alongside a 21 percent increase in water used. That’s still not bad, a long-time Sierra Club leader told us by phone. Ken Kramer, water resources chairman for Sierra’s Texas chapter, told us, "It’s still very significant. Especially as compared to other major cities around the state. … It is great that San Antonio is doing this, and it does provide a model for other cities that haven’t had that success yet." The trend statewide is toward less water use, Kramer said. State and federal standards, with such requirements as water-efficient showerheads and toilets, have reduced Texans’ per-person water use. Texas as a whole averaged out to about 151 gallons used per person per day in 2007-11, according to the Texas Water Development Board, with the state’s nearly 26 million people using 169 gallons apiece a day during hot, dry 2011. Flores said, and the utility’s stats confirm, that San Antonians reduced per-person water use from around 200 gallons a day in the 1980s (the utility’s stats show the decade averaged out at 197 gallons per day, to be precise) to about 140 gallons a day now (2007-11 average out at 137 gallons per day). Daily water use per capita for 2011 in Texas’ six largest cities shook out this way, according to the water board: Houston, 191 gallons; San Antonio, 148 gallons; Dallas, 197 gallons; Austin, 156 gallons; Fort Worth, 166 gallons; El Paso, 143 gallons. What got San Antonio saving? "A big federal hammer," Puente told us. "Back in the early 1990s, a federal judge actually was going to lay down pumping rules, limit our ability to pump water out of our aquifer, and gave us till the end of the legislative session to pass certain rules that we would impose on ourselves," he said. San Antonio and nearby areas, he said, were hit by the federal deadline because of endangered species that relied on the Edwards Aquifer. Flores outlined some of the Alamo City’s approaches: Smarter use of water pulled from the Edwards, including the nation’s largest direct recycled water delivery system, routing treated wastewater to users such as golf courses, the River Walk and local industry. Pumping all the Edwards water it’s allowed to every year, and storing what it doesn’t use in the Carrizo Aquifer -- which isn’t porous like the Edwards, but hard-packed sand, Flores said. The Edwards water sits there, in fact barely commingling with the Carrizo water, and San Antonio has been extracting it as needed for the past three years. New sources such as a $145 million desalination plant set to start tapping a deeper, saltwater aquifer in 2016. Not pumping as much water in the first place, aka conservation. The water utility educates users and subsidizes ways to use less, both in residential and commercial systems. Flores said the utility has approved conservation projects based on the $400 price to buy rights to an acre-foot of Edwards water for a year. If the project was cheaper than buying the water, the utility implemented the plan. Giving away 325,000 low-flow toilets, even hiring plumbers to help low-income residents install them, cost less than the unsaved water would have, Flores said. Same for helping Coca-Cola retool to clean bottles with pressurized air. Last year, though, mindful of the rising cost of water from the Edwards and other sources, the utility raised the ceiling: Now a project has to save more than buying the water at $1,100 per acre-foot, he said. Outdoor water usage, Puente said, is the next area of focus, with the utility offering rebates to water customers who want to convert a parched part of their lawn to a deck or patio. Our ruling Puente said San Antonio has seen "67 percent growth in the last 25 years, 0 percent more water used." Those are cherry-picked, out-of-date stats, vintage 1984-2009. Up-to-date figures available when Puente spoke, covering 1986-2011, show that as the population served grew 52 percent, water usage increased 21 percent. San Antonio may outpace other cities in water conservation. This claim still washes out as False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-01492	Says Mary Landrieu voted to fund benefits for illegal immigrants ahead of veterans.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/25/bill-cassidy/bill-cassidy-says-mary-landrieu-put-illegal-immigr/	Rep. Bill Cassidy, a Republican running for Senate in Louisiana, mixed two buzzwords of the 2014 campaign cycle — immigrants and veterans — in an ad attacking Democratic opponent Sen. Mary Landrieu. How are the two related? Cassidy said Landrieu chose to fund one but cut from the other. "What would you choose? To fund benefits for veterans or for illegal immigrants? I would never put illegal immigrants ahead of veterans. But Mary Landrieu did," Cassidy said in the ad. "Instead of fully funding veterans’ benefits, she voted to give benefits to those here illegally. No wonder she supports Barack Obama and his amnesty plan." That’s quite the charge, but is it accurate? We decided to take a look. Cassidy is referring to the budget agreement reached in December 2013 between Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. — the top budget negotiators for their respective chambers. The bill prevented another government shutdown and provided some relief from sequestration. (Forgot about the sequester? It’s the 10-year, across-the-board budget cuts that were supposedly so deep and detested by both parties that Congress was expected to reach a grand budget compromise to avoid them, but never did.) Under the agreement, budget caps for discretionary spending are set at $1.012 trillion for fiscal year 2014 and $1.014 trillion for fiscal year 2015. For 2014, that figure is $45 billion more than it would have been under sequestration, and it’s $18 billion more for 2015. How did Congress pay for that? In part, by reducing the cost-of-living adjustments for the retirement pay of veterans under the age of 62. That provision sparked immediate blowback from veterans groups and some members of Congress. But the budget agreement passed the House on Dec. 12, 2013, overwhelmingly, 332-94. Cassidy voted for it. When the bill moved to the Senate, Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., blocked any amendments so the fragile agreement could get an up-or-down vote as it passed the House (another government shutdown was looming in January). But Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., tried to reopen the amendment process so he could introduce an amendment that would have restored the pension cost-of-living reduction for veterans. To pay for increased spending caps, Sessions wanted to instead close a loophole that allowed some undocumented immigrants with children to collect the Additional Child Tax Credit. Sessions' amendment never came up for a vote. The Senate did take up a procedural vote, however, on whether to reopen the amendment process so Session’s amendment, and possibly others, could be heard. However, that vote failed on Dec. 17 largely along party lines, 54-46, with Landrieu voting with her Democratic colleagues. The next day, the bill passed the Senate on a vote of 64 to 36. Cassidy spokesman John Cummins said Landrieu in the Senate could have voted to open the budget agreement to amendments and chose not to. Cassidy did not have that opportunity in the House because Republican leadership pushed it through under structured rule, meaning no amendments were allowed. (For what it's worth, we didn't see any statements from Cassidy lamenting this.) Even if we agreed with this line of reasoning — which we don’t — it doesn’t absolve Cassidy from voting for, and defending, the same reductions to veterans benefits. As both FactCheck.org and the Washington Post Fact Checker noted, on the very day the Senate passed the budget agreement, Cassidy defended the cuts to military pensions on conservative commentator Laura Ingraham’s radio show. Ingraham: "You supported this budget deal and now we find out that military folks who have sacrificed so much are being asked yet again to sacrifice — this in terms of their pensions — and yet we can’t seem to close loopholes for welfare benefits going to illegal aliens and yet you supported this. Why?" Cassidy: "There are no benefit cuts to people who are retiring, there is an adjustment to their cost of living, which starts off not for all, but those who retire before age 62." Cassidy went on to further defend the cut to military pensions as logical reforms without really touching on the second aspect of Ingraham’s question about tax credits for undocumented immigrants. Finally, the House and Senate voted to restore those cuts to veterans benefits the following February. Under the restructured agreement, anyone who signed up for military service before 2014 would not see a change to their benefits. Both Cassidy and Landrieu voted for this, and Obama signed it into law on Feb. 15. Our ruling Cassidy said, "I would never put illegal immigrants ahead of veterans. But Mary Landrieu did." There are several problems with this statement. First is the false dichotomy that Landrieu had a choice between funding undocumented immigrants and veterans in the budget agreement. That amendment never actually came up for a vote. But even putting that aside, Cassidy suggests that his position is vastly different than Landrieu. In fact, they both voted in favor of the same budget agreement to reduce future cost-of-living adjustments for veterans benefits (they both also voted to restore them), with Cassidy going on conservative radio to defend these cuts. Cassidy ignores his own record to inaccurately criticize Landrieu’s. That extra level of hypocrisy bumps his claim to ridiculous, and we rate it Pants on Fire.

pomt-14775	A Muslim immigrant in Michigan can list his second, third or fourth wives as "extended family" and qualify for welfare.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/07/chain-email/youtube-video-says-michigan-muslims-can-list-multi/	A widely shared YouTube video makes outrageous claims about Muslims, multiple wives and welfare. The year-old video, which is based on a chain email, says polygamous Muslim men who live in Michigan can receive welfare benefits for up to four wives through a loophole. "It's official. The camel's nose is in the governmental bureaucratic tent in Michigan, feeding on our hard-earned money we pay in taxes!" the video says. "Muslim men are allowed four wives. So when they immigrate to America, they simply list wife number two, three and four as ‘extended family,’ to qualify for welfare and a myriad of other taxpayer-funded government programs." A few readers wanted to know if the video has any truth to it. Are Michigan taxpayers actually paying for Muslims to rake in welfare benefits for up to four wives? Why Michigan? Why Muslims? The video seems to have originated from cleantv.com, which claims to offer "family-friendly television broadcasting and Video On Demand services…[and] Internet-ready television sets." The site’s YouTube channel features dozens of politically charged videos. (Check out Snopes for an in-depth look at the video’s entire narrative.) We can’t be sure why the video focuses on Michigan. The state does have one of the largest Arab populations in the country, and various Michigan state government agencies offer Arabic versions of documents to accommodate those residents. But there’s nothing unique about Michigan’s applications for welfare compared to other states. As for polygamy, it is illegal in the United States. The U.S. government only recognizes one legal spouse. There are no reliable estimates for the number of American Muslims living in polygamous families, though NPR quoted experts putting it between 50,000 and 100,000. Still, the idea that a Muslim man could simply bring himself and multiple wives through the American immigration system is off-base. The immigration process for spouses is lengthy and complicated. Even if a man successfully sponsors his wife for an immigrant visa, the State Department specifically outlines that "in cases of polygamy, only the first spouse may qualify as a spouse for immigration." Any other wives would have to apply for an immigrant visa on their own. When the immigrants legally settle in the United States, they can apply for welfare programs, such as cash through Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, food stamps or Medicaid, provided they meet requirements for residency, expenses and assets. A man could only claim one wife for purposes of welfare benefits, because multiple wives is a no-no. The video suggests that a Muslim man could register his second, third or fourth wives as "extended family" for extended benefits. Is that really how it’s done? It wouldn’t exactly work like that, experts said. "For cash assistance and Medicaid, as per federal rules, only one spouse can be included in a group for determining eligibility," said Bob Wheaton, a spokesman for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. "Any other non-related members of the household can’t be included." In a polygamous home, the other wives would not be recognized as legal family members. Food stamps However, a family doesn’t face those same requirements when applying for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps. Federal rules for SNAP eligibility depend on the number of household members. So it’s theoretically possible for a Muslim man, or any man, to collect food assistance for multiple wives. "Whether those household members are related or not does not matter under federal rules," Wheaton said. "What matters is whether they live in the same household and prepare food together." Of course, that would apply to any polygamous family, not just Muslim ones. A 2008 CBS report showed how fundamentalist, polygamist families in Colorado City, Ariz., receive big welfare checks: The man marries one wife legally and then weds and has kids with multiple other wives recognized by the church. Then, the other wives register for benefits as single women with children. (For reference, the maximum monthly allotment for food stamps is $1,169 for a family of eight. Each additional person in the household brings in an extra $146.) Michael Wiseman, a research professor at George Washington University, said this is legal under SNAP rules. "The SNAP benefit formula recognizes ‘economies of scale,’ so that breaking the subfamilies apart increases total benefits paid," he said. "Thus it is not fraud, as long as any contributions to the second family from the first are reported by the second family and included in benefits calculation." The states could theoretically crack down on these loopholes in the system, but Wiseman said it might not be worth the trouble. "The problem is, of course, deciding how to write rules that prevent this and yet ensure that some groups are subject to more intense investigation than others," he said. "My guess is the fiscal impact is minimal." Our ruling A viral YouTube video said that in Michigan, a Muslim man "lists one wife as his, and signs the other two or three up as extended family on welfare." The video and the chain email its based off of is highly misleading and ignores important realities of the U.S. immigration and welfare system in an attempt to drum up anti-Muslim sentiment. For one, the rules of the immigration system make it very hard for immigrants who may have multiple wives to enter the country, as the United States does not recognize polygamy. There is also no evidence that Michigan or any other state would allow or encourage Muslims to sign up extra wives as "extended family." For most welfare programs, it would not be possible for additional wives to qualify for assistance. However, a Muslim man with multiple wives (and meets the right income and residency requirements) could theoretically benefit through food stamps because it is based on the number of people in the household, not just legally recognized family members. But this would be true for any polygamist family, not just Muslims in Michigan. Flaws in the system don’t exactly mean the government is subsidizing polygamy. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-09719	When White House communications director Anita Dunn said that Mao Tse-tung was "one of her favorite philosophers, only Fox News picked that up."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/27/bill-oreilly/oreilly-accuses-media-not-following-foxs-lead-anit/	In a recent segment with conservative commentator Ann Coulter, Fox News Channel host Bill O'Reilly slammed other media outlets for failing to cover a story — unearthed by Fox — that a senior aide to Barack Obama had told high school students that one of her "favorite political philosophers" was Mao Tse-tung, the late Chinese communist leader who is blamed for the deaths of millions of people. The O'Reilly-Coulter exchange, aired on Oct. 23, 2009, came amid a war of words between the White House and Fox. Anita Dunn, the White House communications director and a longtime Democratic operative, emerged this month as one of the leading figures in a White House push to discredit Fox News, telling the New York Times ' Brian Stelter, "We're going to treat [Fox] the way we would treat an opponent. ... We don't need to pretend that this is the way that legitimate news organizations behave." Dunn's comments added heat to an already simmering feud, and it wasn't long before Glenn Beck — the conservative Fox host who frequently riles the White House and its allies — responded in kind. On the Oct. 15, 2009, episode of his Fox show, Beck aired a video of a speech Dunn made to high school students. In it, Dunn imparted a series of life lessons to the students, the third of which "actually comes from two of my favorite political philosophers: Mao Tse-tung and Mother Teresa, not often coupled together, but the two people that I turn to most to basically deliver a simple point, which is, you're going to make choices. You're going to challenge. You're going to say why not. You're going to figure out how to do things that have never been done before." Dunn then told an anecdote about how Mao triumphed as an underdog over his rival, nationalist leader Chiang Kai-Shek, during the Chinese civil war. Asked how he would win, Mao said, according to Dunn, "You know, you fight your war, and I'll fight mine." Dunn continued, "And think about that for a second. You don't have to accept the definition of how to do things, and you don't have to follow other people's choices and paths, okay? It is about your choices and your path. You fight your own war. You lay out your own path. You figure out what's right for you. You don't let external definitions define how good you are internally." Beck's discovery that a senior Obama White House official had said nice things about a Communist leader with a bloody place in history was catnip for Fox, and for a host of conservative bloggers. Let's explore whether O'Reilly is correct that "only Fox News picked that up. Nobody else picked that up." It's certainly true that Fox played the story to the hilt: In a 10-day span after the story broke, Fox shows mentioned the incident, either in depth or in passing, roughly two dozen times. As for other news organizations, we found they rarely treated it as a news story. But there was a fair amount of discussion about Dunn's remark, usually in commentaries or analyses of the Fox-White House feud: — In opinion columns . Two syndicated columnists based at the Washington Post wrote about Dunn's Mao comment. Kathleen Parker, a conservative with a maverick streak, wrote a pox-on-both-their-houses column, while Charles Krauthammer (a frequent panelist on Fox) penned one that was critical of Dunn and favorable to Fox. Both ran on the Post 's op-ed page and were reprinted in newspapers across the country. A handful of newspapers also wrote editorials that cited the episode. Meanwhile, Philadelphia Inquirer columnist Dick Polman published a column in the paper (and later an expanded version online) that took Fox and Beck to task. "How helpful is Beck, after all, when he morphs into Joe McCarthy on Fox News, and attempts to red-bait a top Obama aide by painting her as a communist sympathizer in thrall to Mao Tse-tung?" Polman asked. "Last week, Beck characterized Anita Dunn as a 'fan of a guy who killed millions of people.' He then aired a video clip that showed Dunn quoting Mao during a June speech. Shocking! What Beck naturally neglected to tell his credulous viewers is that politicians of all stripes have been quoting Mao for years. Such as: 'In the words of Chairman Mao, it’s always darkest before it’s totally black.' (That was John McCain). Such as: 'Mao said politics is war without bloodshed. Clearly there are some metaphors that sit nicely with politics.' (That was Christian conservative leader Ralph Reed.)" — As media criticism . The Washington Post' s media critic, Howard Kurtz, made brief references to the Mao controversy as he dissected the Fox-White House feud in two of his daily Media Notes blog posts. — In remarks by TV commentators . On the Oct. 18, 2009, edition of CNN's State of the Union with John King , commentators discussed the war between the White House and Fox. Bill Bennett, a conservative, brought up the Dunn-Mao connection. Saying it "isn't a small thing — it's a big thing," Bennett told the panel, "Now, look, I am not a right-wing nut, and when people go after Obama and say 'socialism and Marxism,' I say, take it easy, you know, calm down. But when she stands up, in a speech to high school kids, says she's deeply influenced by Mao Tse-tung, that — I mean, that is crazy." Meanwhile, Lou Dobbs, on his nightly news show on CNN, gave a brief hat tip to Beck's story (adding that Mao may have been responsible for "as many as 100 million" deaths) before proceeding into a plug for his syndicated radio show, where viewers could "hear more of my thoughts on all the president's czars and their fascination with Mao Tse-tung." On CNN (which has had its own war of words with Fox, its longtime cable news rival), the Situation Room put resident curmudgeon Jack Cafferty on the Mao story, asking viewers what they thought. "T.J." wrote to Cafferty, "Enough already. Stop reporting anything about Glenn Beck. He is an insane nut job. His opinion is of no value to anyone, except other nut jobs. Stop enabling this psychotic fraud by constantly reporting what he has to say about, well, anything." "J.R. in Idaho" wrote, "When you report on the stories you have created, you have become illegitimate. Fox is 'balloon boy.'" Others were critical of the White House for taking on a fight it was unlikely to win. — Only rarely as straight news . The day after Beck aired the video, CNN's Suzanne Malveaux and Ed Hornick posted a Web story in which Dunn said that the Mao quote "is one I picked up from the late Republican strategist Lee Atwater from something I read in the late 1980s, so I hope I don't get my progressive friends mad at me." She added that "the use of the phrase 'favorite political philosophers' was intended as irony, but clearly the effort fell flat — at least with a certain Fox commentator whose sense of irony may be missing." On Oct. 18, the Associated Press moved a story that recapped the controversy in a straightforward way. (It was written by the AP's television writer, David Bauder, not one of its national political writers.) A day later, the Los Angeles Times ' Top of the Ticket blog briefly mentioned the Mao-Dunn flap in an item about the larger Fox-White House conflict. And the New York Times ' Caucus blog took up the issue twice. The first time, on Oct. 16, 2009, Sheryl Gay Stolberg wrote a post explaining the Dunn-Mao controversy, saying that "the war of words between the White House and Fox News is intensifying — and getting personal." Two days later, the blog offered an update on the Fox-White House war, adding the following quote from Dunn: "Let it be noted that I also quoted Mother Teresa, but no one is accusing me of being a saint!" So let's recap. If O'Reilly's point is that few media outlets played the story as worthy of straight news coverage, he's probably right. With only a few exceptions, the media coverage we found consisted either of opinion columns (both pro and con), purposeful mentions of it by TV commentators or as a subject for laughs. However, if we stick to his precise wording, O'Reilly is certainly incorrect that "only Fox News" picked up the story. While Fox beat the drum more heavily than anyone — not surprising, since it was the network's story to begin with — CNN and the blogs of several major newspapers also mentioned it. In addition, syndicated versions of two Washington Post columns appeared in many newspapers around the country. We rate his statement False.

pomt-03901	Due to the sequester, "people are going to be unsafe. Homes are going to burn."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/mar/01/ami-bera/rep-ami-bera-says-due-sequester-people-are-going-b/	With an across-the-board federal cut looming, Rep. Ami Bera, D-Calif., took to the House floor to sound a sequester fire alarm. "Mr. Speaker, the American public is tired of the blame game. They want to see real solutions. Irresponsible, across-the-board spending cuts are not a real solution. If we don't act to avoid these spending cuts, we threaten the very safety of our community and our country. "There will be $50 million cut from firefighting funding. In my own district, that's $1.5 million in SAFER grants. Let me translate that. My fire chief, Kurt Henke, says that's the equivalent of one engine company and slower response times. People are going to be unsafe, homes are going to burn. We have to act. "Mr. Speaker, I urge you to lock us in a room and cut a deal. Let's figure out how to avoid sequestration. This is devastating to our economy and our country." Really? Homes are going to burn because of the sequester? Let’s recap how the sequester works. Unless a deal is struck, most types of federal spending must be cut by a uniform amount -- tentatively 7.9 percent for most types of defense discretionary funding and 5.3 percent for non-defense discretionary funding. (Certain programs are shielded from sequestration cuts entirely, including Social Security, federal retirement payments, veterans compensation, Medicaid, Pell Grants, food stamps, Supplemental Security Income, and veteran's health programs. Medicare would be cut by 2 percent.) The uniform cuts must be applied to any "program, project or activity" that isn’t otherwise exempted. We found two main federal firefighting grants programs: Staffing for Adequate Fire & Emergency Response (or SAFER) Grants, which focus on personnel, and Assistance to Firefighter Grants (AFG), which focuses on non-personnel expenditures such as equipment. The Sacramento example The Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District, the one headed by Chief Henke, won grants from both in December 2012. including a $5.6 million SAFER grant for "hiring." (It also won an AFG grant worth $370,277 for "wellness and fitness programs," but we won’t factor that in since Bera didn’t mention it.) If all SAFER grants nationally were to be cut by an equal amount, then a 5.3 percent reduction in Sacramento’s SAFER funding would be roughly $300,000. That’s less than the $1.5 million Bera cited, and Bera’s office acknowledged to PolitiFact that the congressman may not have given the correct figure. Here’s a fuller explanation. In an interview, Henke said his department has lost millions of dollars because of a decline in property tax receipts. The fire department closed three firehouses and sidelined six engine companies, which led to "significantly longer response times," Henke said. To improve its response to calls, the department sought SAFER grants to cover the cost of two additional engine companies. Henke said they would help the department meet the "two in, two out" rule, which requires that two firefighters remain outside a burning building before two can enter it. Because $1.5 million is the ballpark estimate for the cost of one engine company, that’s where Bera got his number. But that’s speculation; that’s five-times the proportionate cut we calculated. So Bera’s number was a significant exaggeration. The national outlook Beyond Sacramento, is it accurate for Bera to say that, due to the sequester, "people are going to be unsafe. Homes are going to burn"? We spoke with experts who said there is some truth to that. They said cuts to firefighting grants will put more pressure on existing fire services and, on the margins, could result in greater damage or casualties, though the extent is certainly speculative. "In some cases, response will be affected," said James Pharr, a professor in the Eastern Kentucky University College of Justice and Safety who previously served as a firefighter, fire investigator, fire chief, fire marshal and emergency management director. "Slow or inadequate response can reduce the ability to prevent death or serious injury." Thomas J. Cova, director of the Center for Natural and Technological Hazards at the University of Utah, emphasized that sequester comes on top of budgetary strains caused by the recession. "Budgets have already been reduced in the last four years at all levels -- local, state, and federal -- to the point that more cuts could noticeably compromise response capabilities," Cova said. "All the obvious corners have already been cut, and that means, unfortunately, that further cuts could result in structures burning that otherwise wouldn’t, due to reduced response times, personnel, and equipment." Shawn S. Kelley, the director of strategic services for the International Association of Fire Chiefs Kelley, said rural departments stand to be hurt more than big cities because the rural agencies are more dependent on federal grants. Still, we see several reasons why Bera’s claim is exaggerated. • Federal funds are a small portion of most fire departments’ budgets. In Sacramento’s case, this year’s total budget is $153 million, meaning that the SAFER grant accounts for 3.6 percent of the budget. That means the sequester could hold back two-tenths of 1 percent of the department’s entire budget. We were unable to find specific data nationally, but several experts agreed that Sacramento’s case is not unusual. "Most municipal fire departments are locally funded," said William John Siembieda, who heads the city and regional planning department at California Polytechnic State University. "Federal dollars are not a large part of annual budgets." In other words, Bera didn't have enough justification to sound such a strong alarm. The kind of rhetoric Bera used "been rejected" by firefighter organizations in trying to fend off proposed cuts, said Anthony Brown, an Oklahoma State University professor who specializes in fire and emergency management. • Not every locality will be losing federal firefighting money due to the sequester. Both programs are competitive grants, meaning that a locality will apply for federal funds and, if it’s lucky, it will get a grant. Many localities will either decline to apply for the grants or fail to receive them. So while Sacramento may lose money due to sequester cuts, not every local fire department in the country will. Those departments that didn’t receive grant money in the most recent round won’t be directly affected by such sequester cuts at all. • It can be difficult to determine whether local cuts or sequester cuts are at fault for personnel decreases. SAFER funds are, in effect, responding to what is happening at the local level. If a firefighter is laid off, or is about to be laid off, and then sees his job restored by a SAFER grant, then sees that funding taken away due to the sequester, is that all the fault of the sequester, or is it partially the fault of the local budgetary situation? We think it’s a mixture of both, and thus it’s a stretch for Bera to blame the sequester. • The Obama administration proposed even bigger cuts for these programs in its fiscal year 2013 budget proposal. In its 2013 budget, the Obama administration proposed an amount 17 percent lower than its level two years earlier, an average of more than 8 percent per year. That’s a bigger cut than the sequester itself. So if the administration or its allies are going to cry foul at sequester cuts, the same charge could be leveled at the administration’s own policies. Our ruling Bera said that due to the sequester, "people are going to be unsafe. Homes are going to burn." The precise impact of sequester cuts on firefighting is speculative, but it’s safe to assume there will be some impact on the margins, at least in places that receive federal firefighting grants. Still, Bera’s language is overheated, both on Sacramento’s case in particular and in the overall picture. In the communities lucky enough to receive SAFER grants, such funds typically account for a small portion of the total departmental budget. In addition, firehouse woes do not begin and end with the sequester; local budgets and policies also deserve some blame. Finally, blaming the sequester obscures even larger cuts the administration itself proposed prior to the sequester. On balance, we rate Bera’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-05215	"In Galveston, Texas, they have allowed people to privatize part of their Social Security. And people are building wealth."	true	/virginia/statements/2012/jun/08/ew-jackson/ew-jackson-says-galveston-has-privatized-plan-lieu/	When Republican E.W. Jackson extols free markets, he points to the gulf coast in Texas. "Right now, in our own country, in Galveston, Texas, they have allowed people to privatize part of their Social Security. And people are building wealth," he said in a recent debate between the four Republicans running in the June 12 primary for the U.S. Senate. We decided check out Jackson’s statement. It required two determinations: 1) Does Galveston have a private retirement plan in lieu of Social Security taxes and; 2) If so, how does the system build wealth? The Galveston Plan Greg Aldridge, a spokesman for Jackson’s campaign, pointed us to a number of news stories about Galveston’s alternative to Social Security. The plan has been considered as a potential model for changing the federal entitlement. The program is an oddity in American retirement-security policy. In 1981, municipal employees of three adjoining Texas counties -- Galveston, Matagorda and Brazoria -- voted to withdraw from Social Security and initiate a system of individual accounts to provide retirement, survivor and disability benefits. In 1983, the federal government barred any more such moves by local governments. Today, there are about 10 million Americans in the workforce who do not contribute and will not benefit from Social Security. Most of them are employees of school districts and higher education institutions that opted out before the ban. Here’s how the Galveston plan works: Instead of paying into Social Security, county government workers contribute a similar amount to their investment accounts. The General Accounting Office wrote in 1999 that the plan made "very conservative" investments in bonds and preferred stocks. The investments are made through fixed annuity contracts with private firms that guarantee minimum annual rates of return. While each worker is assigned an individual account, the employee does not control all investment decisions. The interest earned on investments is deposited in each worker’s account. Employees can put extra money beyond the required amount into their accounts. The required retirement contribution is 9.7 percent of gross pay -- of which 6.1 percent is paid by the employees and 3.6 percent by the county. Social Security traditionally collects 12.4 percent in payroll tax on up to $106,800 in total salary, with workers and employers evenly splitting the levy. But under President Barack Obama’s FICA tax cut over the last two years, the federal government has collected only 10.4 percent -- of which 4.2 percent is paid by the worker. Social Security invests the contributions in government securities. When the Texas county employees retire, they may choose to take the entire account’s earnings in lump sum, take monthly payments for a specified number of years, or accept smaller monthly payments in a lifetime annuity. The Galveston plan does not offer cost-of-living increases to those receiving monthly checks. Social Security provides a lifetime annuity with annual cost-of-living adjustments. And, unlike the Galveston system, it also provides increased payment to beneficiaries with spouses and dependents. Does it build wealth? Jackson supports a Republican proposal that would create individual Social Security accounts and phase in investment options. He says on his website that the proposal would "allow participants to obtain better returns on the market" than they do under the current system. But Jackson, while extolling the Galveston plan during the debate, did not claim that it was outperforming Social Security. Aldridge said that Jackson, in saying the program was "building wealth," simply meant that individuals have ownership and some control over their retirement account. Galveston plan designer Rick Gornto, who is president of First Financial Benefits Inc., claimed that as the major advantage to the plan. "The key thing is you don’t have ownership in Social Security or a right to that except the right that they decide to give you, which can change," he said. Gornto could not provide an average annual return for plan investors because each chooses a mix of mutual funds to go along with the more stable bond investments in the fund. But, he said, retirement funds must, by contract, increase annually by at least 3.75 percent or 4 percent. During good times, Gornto said employees have seen annual returns of 10 percent or better. Does the Galveston plan outperform Social Security? The most recent studies of this question are 13 years old and provided a complicated answer. The GAO and the Social Security Administration each analyzed the Galveston plan in 1999. They generally agreed that the higher an employee’s salary, the more he or she would benefit from the counties’ system. But middle- and low-income earners would likely collect less from Galveston plan than they would from Social Security. We spoke to Eric Kingson, professor at Syracuse University’s School of Social Work and co-chairman of Strengthen Social Security, a group that wants to maintain benefits from the federal entitlement. He said the Galveston program is a "savings plan, not a retirement insurance plan" that best serves a small group of workers. "The only people who might do better are single persons who have higher incomes," he said. "Particularly for low and moderate income persons, they are not better off. If you are not married, not going to drop dead early, not leave widows or survivors and don’t want automatic life insurance for children, then it could be better." Our ruling Jackson is correct that Galveston, Texas, has a privately run retirement plan in lieu of Social Security. The program benefits municipal workers in Galveston County and two neighboring counties. It’s debatable whether the Galveston plan, overall, offers workers a superior financial alternative to Social Security; in some cases it does, in others it doesn’t. But, as Jackson said, the plan does build wealth because it allows workers to create individual retirement accounts that are guaranteed to earn interest each year. The employees have some control over their accounts and can leave them to their survivors. So we rate Jackson’s claim True.	None	E.W.

pomt-06379	Says "Essex County residents suffer the second highest property taxes in the nation."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/nov/02/joseph-chiusolo/essex-countys-property-taxes-among-highest-nation/	Essex County residents have a second-place finish to marvel at -- only it’s not one they may be too happy about. In his bid to unseat county Freeholder Leonard Luciano, Republican candidate Joseph Chiusolo pointed to the county’s high property taxes in an Oct. 25 press release. In fact, according to Chiusolo, "Essex County residents suffer the second highest property taxes in the nation." PolitiFact New Jersey found that Chiusolo’s statistic was accurate to some degree. In terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of the median household income, Essex County ranks second in the nation. But when two other types of measurements are considered, Essex County is up there, but not second. "The bottom line is, if you’re sixth or two, the taxes are high," Chiusolo told us. "People out there are hurting." Let’s explain where Chiusolo received his numbers. Chiusolo, the deputy mayor of Cedar Grove, referred us to data compiled by the Washington, DC-based Tax Foundation, a business-backed group that studies tax policy. The data represents five-year averages for the period between 2005 and 2009. For that time period, the Tax Foundation ranked property taxes in owner-occupied homes in counties according to three measurements: median property taxes paid; taxes as a percentage of the median home value; and taxes as a percentage of the median household income. Each statistic comes with a margin of error. On that last measurement, Essex County ranked second among 2,922 counties with property taxes representing about 8.04 percent of the median household income. The only county above Essex was neighboring Passaic County, where property taxes were about 8.44 percent. So, Chiusolo is right on that point, but according to those two other measurements, Essex County didn't score as high. Essex County’s median property tax bill was about $7,489, ranking it sixth in the nation. At about 1.9 percent of the median home value, Essex County ranked 92nd. Thomas Ammirato, a consultant working on Chiusolo‘s campaign, pointed out how an earlier press release specified that the ranking refers to the percentage of income. But we told Ammirato that this fact-check is based on the Oct. 25 press release. Still, Chiusolo’s overall point is accurate that Essex County has some of the highest property taxes in the nation -- and as far as other New Jersey counties, it’s not alone. Among the top 10 counties for the five-year average of median property taxes paid, seven of them are in New Jersey: Hunterdon, Bergen, Essex, Somerset, Morris, Union and Passaic. One of the major factors behind the rankings is the high property values in New Jersey, according to Mark Robyn, an economist with the Tax Foundation. Kim Rueben, who directs the state and local program of the nonpartisan Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, added that part of the reason for high property taxes in the Garden State is that a lot of money to pay for local schools comes from property taxes. New Jersey also has more generous government services than other states, Rueben said. "It’s a high government-service state," Rueben said. "New Jersey has relatively high taxes and relatively generous public spending." Our ruling In a press release, Chiusolo claimed "Essex County residents suffer the second highest property taxes in the nation." That’s true if you’re looking at property taxes as a percentage of the median household income. But Essex County’s property taxes rank sixth and 92nd according to two other measurements.

pomt-04674	"The auditor [for the city of Providence] was not locked out" of access to the city's finances.	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/sep/07/david-cicilline/u-s-rep-david-cicilline-says-when-he-was-mayor-pro/	U.S. Rep. David Cicilline is facing a tough reelection campaign, in part, because by the time he finished his tenure as mayor of Providence, the city was in horrible financial shape and Cicilline, during his 2010 congressional campaign, had characterized the city's fiscal status as "excellent." Making matters worse are allegations that Cicilline tried to hide the problems from Providence's internal auditor. Not surprisingly, the issue came up Sept. 4 when he debated his opponent in the 1st District Democratic primary, Anthony Gemma, on WPRO radio. "The fact of the matter is he locked out the city auditor," Gemma said of Cicilline. "So why would you lock out the city auditor, when the auditor needs to file for a Freedom of Information request to get in to do the very job that he was supposed to do, when you're not trying to hide something?" Cicilline called the allegation "absolutely false. The auditor was not locked out and so that is absolutely untrue." Cicilline's emphatic denial seemed ripe for an audit of its own. At the center of this dispute is James J. Lombardi III, who served as Providence's internal auditor and, as an employee of the City Council, had a sometimes contentious relationship with the Cicilline administration. He is now the city's treasurer. (The city also has an external audit done every year by an outside company. That report, dated January 2011, confirmed the financial problems.) In the fall of 2010, when Cicilline was winding down his tenure as mayor and in the middle of a tough race for the U.S. House, Lombardi was complaining that Providence's finances were in trouble and he was having trouble getting access to information. We found some justification for Gemma's assertion that Lombardi was "locked out." Two Providence Journal stories by two different reporters in March 2011 reported that Lombardi said the administration had canceled his computer access when he began to ask questions about the city's finances, forcing him to seek information by filing formal requests under the Rhode Island Access to Public Records Act. Lombardi now says that he was never locked out of his computer. His computer access to city financial records was never canceled, he said, because he never had such access in the first place. Nor was he ever physically locked out of his office or anywhere else where he tried to get records. That would mean Cicilline is correct in the strictest sense of the phrase "locked out." But you can still be figuratively locked out if you are denied access to something you're legally entitled to. Providence's City Charter requires the City Council to appoint an internal auditor who "shall have access to the books and records of all offices, department and other agencies of the city." That section of the charter offers no limitation. The auditor reports to the council, not the mayor. Lombardi, whose complaints about his inability to get information from the mayor's office go back to 2004, told us that in this case the problem wasn't that he was denied the information. The problem was the timeliness of the responses he was getting. A key issue was whether the city's reserve fund -- sometimes called the rainy-day fund -- was being severely depleted. City records show that on Jan. 11, 2010, Lombardi had requested copies of all authorization forms transferring money in and out of the reserve fund in January 2010, which the Cicilline administration was tapping because of its budget problems. Three days later, he wrote to the city solicitor's office asking it to assist with the request because, if that request was treated like other requests he had made in the past, "I will never see it." Lombardi said if that couldn't be done, he would request the data under the state open records law, adding that he thought it was "ridiculous" that he would have to do such a thing. He did not get the information until October 2010, according to a report he filed with the City Council. That's nine months. When we asked the Cicilline campaign about the delay, spokesman Eric Hyers said "there was absolutely not any plan to delay him, to do anything secretly or to stonewall him." Hyers said Lombardi "had access to whatever he needed. He oftentimes had very unrealistic expectations as to what the turnaround time should be and how soon he should be provided with certain information. At times he assumed that City Hall officials were his own personal staff; they had their own jobs to do." Hyers said "this constant tug of war over what he was entitled to and when he should have it was not unique to 2010. It started several, several years ago." We saw two other examples. In May, according to city records, Lombardi requested a cash flow analysis and was told by the Cicilline administration that (a.) one didn't exist and (b.) the administration was not obligated to generate one just for him under the open records law. Also in May, he asked Bruce Miller, the city's finance director, for a schedule detailing how the Cicilline administration planned to balance the city's budget. He was told that, until the plan was finalized, he wasn't entitled to see it under the open records law. Lombardi said he ultimately received the information he wanted in October 2010. That was after the Democratic primary, where Gemma was one of Cicilline’s opponents, and before the general election, where Cicilline ran against Republican John Loughlin. Loughlin was able to use that information in a Channel 12 debate, during which Cicilline, while touting his accomplishments as mayor, made the now-infamous declaration that Providence was in "excellent financial condition." That record would become seriously tarnished after the election when an independent audit made the full extent of Providence's financial problems painfully clear. Our ruling Former Providence Mayor David Cicilline said that the internal auditor for the city "was not locked out" of access to the city's finances. The auditor now says that he was not locked out in the usual sense of the word. But there's a fine line between being locked out and stonewalled. Cicilline's spokesman emphatically says that "neither of those happened." But the record shows that Lombardi faced many months of delay in getting information he was entitled to by the City Charter. He was forced to use the state’s open records law to get information and waited months for it. And key information -- that Cicilline had been tapping the rainy day fund -- wasn’t provided until October 2010, after Cicilline’s primary victory. Whether it was part of a long-running political wrangle between the mayor and the City Council, which hires the internal auditor, is irrelevant. Open record laws require the release of information regardless of the motives of the person seeking it. The auditor was not locked out in the strictest sense. But the inability of the internal auditor to get information that might have led to a timely disclosure of the city's serious financial problems had the same effect. Because the statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-13786	"Hillary Clinton invented ISIS with her stupid policies. She is responsible for ISIS."	false	/florida/statements/2016/jul/20/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrongly-blames-hillary-clinton-creati/	Donald Trump and his vice presidential candidate Mike Pence gave their first joint interview to 60 Minutes and used the show to point the finger at Hillary Clinton for ISIS. Trump told CBS’s Lesley Stahl that the United States will have to declare war against ISIS -- and he vowed to do it with very few troops on the ground to wipe out ISIS. "Hillary Clinton invented ISIS with her stupid policies," Trump said in an interview that aired July 17. "She is responsible for ISIS." Trump has made this claim repeatedly. It’s wrong, and we’ll explain why. The roots of ISIS Trump was referring to Clinton’s actions related to Iraq, Libya and Syria, said Trump spokesman Stephen Miller, who referred us to a previous Trump speech on the topic. The sources of ISIS are complex and interconnected, said John Pike, an expert on defense and director of GlobalSecurity.org, a website that provides information on defense. "She may ‘share some of the blame’ but there is more than enough share to go around. She was in no sense the singular author of the thing," Pike said. For starters, the terrorist group’s roots pre-date Obama’s presidency and Clinton’s role as secretary of state. It has gone by several names since 2004, when long-time Sunni extremist Abu Mus‘ab al-Zarqawi established al-Qaida in Iraq (AQI), also known as the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) and more recently the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), according to the National Counterterrorism Center. After he was killed in a 2006 U.S. airstrike, the group became the Islamic State of Iraq. In 2013, the group was referred to as the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham and then just the Islamic State in 2014. Given the timing, Democrats blame President George W. Bush for the creation of ISIS, because al-Qaida flourished after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. Obama’s decision to leave Iraq after 2011 contributed to the security vacuum that gave ISIS the chance to put down roots there, said Michael O’Hanlon, a security expert at the Brookings Institution, a centrist-to-liberal group. (O’Hanlon is one of hundreds of voluntary advisers to the Clinton campaign but has a minor role.) You could say the blame touches both Bush, for creating a strong space for al-Qaida in Mesopotamia, and Obama, for giving the group a chance to regroup. As for Clinton, Trump’s campaign points to her vote as a senator to authorize force in Iraq in 2002. She later said she regretted that vote. Republicans have blamed Obama for not keeping 10,000 troops in place in Iraq, which they say could have deterred the opening for ISIS. However, Obama inherited a timeline to exit Iraq from Bush, and there was no agreement to leave a large force behind. Trump’s campaign also points to Clinton’s positions on Syria and Libya. In 2011, she echoed Obama’s support for regime change in Syria in 2011. "The transition to democracy in Syria has begun, and it's time for Assad to get out of the way," she said while secretary of state in August 2011. Regime change in Libya also gave ISIS an opening, said Christopher Preble, a defense expert at the libertarian Cato Institute. "Clinton's enthusiasm for regime change in Libya in 2011, which Obama endorsed, resulted in the collapse of order there, which ISIS and others have exploited," he said. "That is a fair criticism, in my opinion." It’s possible to argue that these factors -- withdrawing from Iraq, the administration’s lack of support to anti-Assad rebels in Syria and the decision to intervene in Libya -- contributed to the power of ISIS, said Austin Long, a Columbia University international and public affairs professor. "Then Sen. Clinton's vote for the Iraq war could also be seen as contributing the preconditions for the emergence of al-Qaida in Iraq," Long said. "So Trump's argument cannot simply be dismissed out of hand." However, Clinton was in favor of supporting Syrian rebels and was overruled by Obama and advocated strongly for maintaining a moderate troop presence in Iraq after 2011. "So on both of those points, I don't think it was Clinton leading Obama -- rather, it was the reverse," Long said. "The Libya intervention and the vote for the Iraq war are thus the only points in the argument that actually stand up to scrutiny." On her vote related to the Iraq war, Clinton was many of many in both parties who supported the intervention advocated by Bush. "On Libya while this clearly appears to have been a mistake in hindsight it was a fairly minor contribution to the emergence of ISIS, which grew out of the Iraq and Syrian conflict," Long said. Our ruling Trump said "Hillary Clinton invented ISIS with her stupid policies. She is responsible for ISIS." There were several factors that contributed to the growing power of ISIS, but it’s misleading to pin the responsibility solely on Clinton. For starters, the roots of ISIS trace back to 2004, when Bush was president and before Clinton was Obama’s secretary of state. She did vote to authorize force in Iraq in 2002 while a senator, but that was advocated by the Bush administration and the vast majority of senators. The intervention in Libya, which she supported, did give ISIS an opening, but Trump is overstating her role by saying she is responsible for ISIS. This claim is inaccurate.

pomt-06885	Says that when he was governor of Utah, he worked with the state Legislature to create a flat tax that "cut income taxes by 30 percent."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/28/jon-huntsman/jon-huntsman-touts-record-enacting-flat-tax-how-ac/	Every Republican candidate claims to be a tax-cutter, but former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman says he's done something that few other Republicans can claim: he simplified the state's income taxes and passed a flat tax. During a recent house party in Belmont, N.H., Huntsman responded to a voter's question about whether the aim of the federal tax system should be to raise revenue or influence behavior. "That's one of those trick questions, right?'' Huntsman asked. "Possibly,'' said Bill Goetz, a retired, manufacturing executive living in Belmont. Huntsman went on to describe his philosophy and pointed to his record in Utah. "We got a flat tax out of it, we cut income taxes by 30 percent, it was a cost-neutral affair where we took out the deductions, we took out the biases almost completely, some we didn't get out, and you know what? The state came to life in part because of that.'' Republicans frequently talk a good game about supporting a flat tax, but they often have difficulty getting political support to change the complicated tax laws. So we wondered if Huntsman and the Utah legislature had succeeded in overhauling the state law to the point where it can be considered a flat tax -- and whether they cut income taxes by 30 percent. The Huntsman campaign pointed us to published reports this spring and in 2007 that explained how Huntsman began pushing for the changes soon after he took office in January 2005. "We need a tax policy that is not only friendly to our citizens, but also creates a competitive environment for business. Business as usual will leave us behind our neighboring states," he said during his first State of the State speech in January 2005. Huntsman and the Legislature achieved their goal with two changes in tax law over two years. When Huntsman took office, there were six income tax brackets ranging from 2.3 percent to 7 percent. Ultimately, Huntsman and the Legislature approved a single rate of 5 percent. They created a much flatter tax, stripping away most of the deductions and credits. Utah taxpayers still adjust their income in ways such as counting interest earned on bond income or deducting from income the withdrawals they make from medical savings accounts. The research arm of the Utah Legislature maintains it was not a flat tax in the purest sense. "Although the new system has a single statutory rate of 5.0 percent, it is not a proportional or 'flat' income tax system. Rather, Utah’s new income tax system remains progressive through tax credits,'' said a January 2010 report of the Utah Office of Legislative Research and General Counsel. (A progressive tax system is one in which richer people pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes than poorer people do.) Roughly 90 percent of taxpayers get to claim as a credit from state taxes some of what they claim as deductions and tax exemptions under the federal tax code. The credit phases out and goes away from those making very high incomes in the state. This makes the effective tax rate about 3 percent for Utah taxpayers earning $70,000 a year in 2008 and 4 percent for a household with $100,000 in taxable income, according to the legislative group's analysis. "There's no question this is a single rate tax -- but with the credit, the overwhelming majority of taxpayers do not pay 5 percent of their income,'' said Phil Dean, the policy analyst who authored the 2010 study. Conservative groups give Huntsman high marks for the overhaul and have said they consider it to be a flat tax. The libertarian Cato Institute gave Huntsman the highest score of any governor on tax policy in 2006. Likewise, the Club for Growth praised Huntsman's tax reform while adding there were some "minor blemishes"' that included other tax increases during his tenure. (It's worth noting that both groups fault Huntsman for increases in state spending that occurred under his watch.) In general, most taxpayers ended up paying less in taxes. The Office of Legislative Research and General Counsel estimated that about 97 percent of taxpayers were paying the same or less compared to the 2005 system. As for Huntsman's claim that they "cut income taxes by 30 percent," we find that is a significant exaggeration. He is close to correct if you compare the statutory rate in the top tax bracketbefore and after the tax system changed. The top rate declined from 7 percent to 5 percent, which is a decrease of 28.6 percent. But there are two problems with this measurement. First, it doesn’t address the lower tax brackets. Remember, the lowest rate went up from 2.3 percent to 5 percent. So Huntsman’s 30 percent decrease in the statutory rate didn’t apply to them. That said, it’s worth noting that residents in the lowest tax brackets didn’t necessarily end up paying more in taxes, because under both approaches they got credits that reduced their tax bill. (In fact, about 97 percent pay the same or less in taxes than they did under the old system.) Which brings us to the second problem with Huntsman’s 30 percent description -- that just looking at the drop in the statutory rate, as Huntsman does, says very little about how a taxpayer actually fared after the change. Even after the imposition of the new system, a Utah resident’s tax bill is heavily dependent on their specific circumstances. The 2010 report found that very few taxpayers saved more than $300 on their tax bill, and those who did were mostly in the top 10 percent of earners. Instead, for the bottom 70 percent of earners, the typical savings was between zero and $200. And a $200 savings for someone earning $55,000 is about four-tenths of 1 percent. That’s a much more modest in-pocket savings than a listener would assume from hearing Huntsman’s 30 percent figure. "In dollars and cents, for single taxpayers the annual income tax cut worked out to between $25 and $100,'' Dean said. "Most married taxpayers got a tax cut of $50 to $200." Dean added that a cut in the sales tax effectively doubled the overall tax cut for most families. But even that wouldn’t make the savings approach a 30 percent tax-bill reduction for the vast majority of taxpayers. Our ruling Huntsman said he passed a flat tax and "cut income taxes by 30 percent." On the flat tax question, the changes under Huntsman certainly made it a flatter tax than the one it replaced, since the changes he oversaw combined several tax brackets into one. But the tax remains more complicated to calculate than a pure flat tax would be. In fact, Utah’s system of tax credits make the tax somewhat progressive in practice, which is something a true flat tax would not be. Meanwhile, Huntsman’s 30 percent claim is more misleading. It’s true that the statutory rates in the top bracket declined by almost that much, but the actual reduction in tax dollars paid was far smaller for the overwhelming majority of taxpayers -- usually less than 1 percent of a taxpayer’s adjusted gross income. We think most people hearing Huntsman's comment would believe he was touting a 30 percent cut in what people actually pay at tax time, and the numbers aren’t close to that. So we rate his claim Mostly False.	None	Jon Huntsman	None	None	None	2011-07-28T17:20:24	2011-07-04	['Utah']
pomt-08445	Says gas pumps in different parts of Texas are missing state inspection stickers and/or their inspections are out of date--and that's cheating consumers.	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/oct/16/hank-gilbert/hank-gilbert-says-gas-pumps-every-texas-department/	Hank Gilbert, Democrat for state agriculture commissioner, stood outside a Tyler gas station in September, saying the station's pumps hadn't been inspected by the state to make sure they're working properly since July 1997. "All over the state, we found stations in every (Texas Department of Agriculture) region that either haven't been inspected in years or they have no inspection stickers on them," Gilbert said, according to the Sept. 16 video his campaign posted online. "If this was inspection stickers for vehicles and you had 20 percent of all the vehicles on the road without inspection stickers, it would be in the news media every day and the state would raising all kinds of Cain because of the revenue being lost to the state. But the revenue is not being lost to the state here, the only people here that are getting cheated are the consumers." Sticker-gate? Roll in the Truth-O-Meter. Background: State law requires each gas pump to be inspected at least every four years by a Texas Department of Agriculture inspector, or more often if a consumer makes an inquiry. The department says an inspector "will place an 'out of order' tag on any pump not dispensing the correct amount of fuel within the allowable tolerance." The pump must be repaired, then re-tested by a TDA inspector who will place a new seal on the pump before it can be used again. Agency spokesman Bryan Black told us in an e-mail that from 2007 to Oct. 4, 2010, the agency inspected 390,837 fuel pumps, with the time between inspections averaging 2.6 years, meaning some pumps have been inspected more than once. So, how often are inspection stickers missing from pumps? Also, how often does the state fail to inspect them in the required time? We came up empty on those questions, though a list of inspected stations posted online by the agriculture department shows that in each of the department's five regions, some pumps flunked inspections in the latest review period. From Aug. 5 to Oct. 4, 2010, the agency found 190 stations (including four in Austin) with pumps out of compliance. When we inquired about the number of stations around the state with pumps that have not been inspected, Black replied that the burden to seek inspections is on retailers that sell gas. He said in an e-mail that fuel retailers are required by law to register annually with the department and that violators are investigated and held accountable. Black said in an e-mail: "Since 2007, TDA has quadrupled the penalty for noncompliance with our state's weights and measures laws, created new consumer protections for fuel quality, begun posting violators on the agency website, implemented unprecedented market blitz inspections for those not complying with our laws, and heavily published a toll free hotline for all Texas drivers to use to report noncompliance to TDA." Next, we sought to interview Gilbert about the pumps he says lack inspections or have out-of-date inspection stickers. Gilbert's campaign manager, Vince Leibowitz, said in an e-mail that Gilbert wouldn't talk to PolitiFact Texas, which he said Gilbert considers slanted toward Republicans. Later, Leibowitz sent us e-mails listing 15 stores where he said Gilbert identified pumps out of compliance with the inspection law. In Amarillo, according to Gilbert, seven stores had pumps with no inspection stickers. In the Tyler area, the list shows two stores with pumps having expired stickers and two with pumps lacking inspection stickers. Gilbert's campaign says a store in Trinity has a sticker indicating it was last inspected in the second quarter of 2004 and most pumps at two stores in Round Rock, north of Austin, lacked stickers, meaning they had no proof they'd been inspected. Leibowitz said Gilbert also spotted a store in Weslaco with out-of-date pump stickers. Using a map of agriculture department districts, we confirmed that the identified stations are spread among all the agency's regions, as Gilbert said in Tyler. We lacked travel resources to eye most of Gilbert's proclaimed sightings, but Austin American-Statesman colleagues stopped by the two Round Rock stores. On an Oct. 9 visit by Jay Godwin, a Quix convenience store at Highway 79 and Interstate 35 in Round Rock had 2007 inspection stickers posted on three pumps, with seven pumps lacking stickers. Roger Ingram, general counsel for Strasburger Enterprises, Inc., which owns the store, later told us he didn't know why the pumps lack stickers. "They can be peeled off by just about anybody," Ingram said. On Oct. 11, the newspaper's Miguel Liscano checked a Wag a Bag store noted by Gilbert, on Interstate Highway 35 South; none of its six pumps had an inspection sticker. Cary Rabb, president of Wag a Bag, later told us the pumps were changed out about three months ago, and the company expects the state to inspect the replacement pumps. Separately, Black guided us to an agency website that displays the inspection status of stations county by county. On the site, we tried to check the inspection status of the stations identified by Gilbert, finding several--including the Round Rock stores--with inspections within the past four years, as the law requires. In other parts of Texas, five stores named by Gilbert had their pumps inspected within four years, according to the site, and two Tyler stores had pumps inspected after Gilbert aired concerns there, with some pumps not passing. We found no record on the state site of six Gilbert-identified stores. Gilbert's camp responded to our findings with a statement from Gilbert: "A pump that does not bear a current inspection sticker is, as far as the consumer knows when he or she fills up with gas, uninspected. If it was inspected at some point in the last four years and doesn't bear seals, it is still non-compliant." In an e-mail, Black confirmed that every gas dispenser should have a state inspection seal on it. Possible reasons a pump lacks a sticker, he said, include a flunked inspection, a replaced or refurbished "pump cabinet," someone peeling off the state sticker, a station shifting its pumps without notifying the state and a station opening pumps without registering them with the state. In a later e-mail, Black cautioned against concluding a pump without a sticker has not been inspected, saying any such claims would need to be verified in the agency's database. Scott Fisher, vice president for policy for the Texas Petroleum Marketers and Convenience Store Association, told us that it's "unrealistic" to think all of the hundreds of thousands of pumps across the state would always show inspection stickers. And Chris Newton, the association's president, pointed out in a subsequent e-mail that big ol' Texas leads the nation in pumps subject to regulation. Another factor in pumps lacking stickers, he wrote, is that "many pumps are re-manufactured devices that feature an older façade with an older (state) sticker. The device may in fact be properly registered, but may not have a new sticker." Our call? We're persuaded there are pumps in every TDA region missing inspection stickers, as Gilbert says. However, the absence of stickers doesn't always means pumps haven't been duly inspected, our peek into the state database suggests. Gilbert's grab-your-pocketbook punch line--that consumers are being cheated--isn't proved out. We rate Gilbert's statement Half True.

pomt-14977	The gun industry is "the only business in America that is wholly protected from any kind of liability."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/16/hillary-clinton/clinton-gun-industry-wholly-protected-all-lawsuits/	At the first Democratic debate of the 2016 presidential race, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton criticized opponent Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., for supporting a 2005 law that shields the gun industry from certain lawsuits. Clinton voted against this law when she was a senator, and she has lambasted it several times on the campaign trail this month. "Probably one of the most egregious, wrong, pieces of legislation that ever passed the Congress when it comes to this issue is to protect gun sellers and gun makers from liability," she said in Iowa Oct. 7. "They are the only business in America that is wholly protected from any kind of liability. They can sell a gun to someone they know they shouldn't, and they won't be sued. There will be no consequences." Is Clinton right? Are gun makers and dealers "wholly protected" against any kind of lawsuit, and do no other industries have similar immunities? Short answer: No. The gun industry is susceptible to some lawsuits, and there are federal laws restricting liability for a number of other types of businesses. As support, Clinton’s staff sent us a public health journal article that argues the gun industry’s "broad immunity" against litigation inhibits safe manufacturing and distribution of firearms, though it does not directly address her claim. Exceptions The law at issue is the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which was signed into law by President George W. Bush and seen as a victory for gun rights advocates. The purpose of the law is to protect gun dealers and manufacturers from lawsuits when their products are misused. For example, if a person buys a gun legally and then uses the gun to intentionally kill someone, the gun dealer and manufacturer cannot be held liable for the crime under the law. While opponents argue that the law stops some victims from having their day in court, supporters say the law protects gun dealers and manufacturers from frivolous and expensive legal proceedings. In any case, Clinton goes too far in saying the gun industry is "wholly protected from any kind of liability." The law lists several situations that are not protected from liability. It does not protect gun dealers who transfer a gun knowing it would be used for criminal purposes, nor those who knowingly break state or federal law if the violation results in harm. Gun manufacturers can also be sued if the gun, when used properly, causes injury because the product is defective. "The statement is incorrect insofar as it suggests that gun makers are totally free from liability," said Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California Los Angeles who specializes in gun law. Some opponents of the law argue that the liability protection is so broad and ambiguous, and the exceptions so narrow, that some legitimate lawsuits won’t have a chance to appear in court. But this is different from saying the gun industry is wholly immune to all lawsuits. Clinton also said the gun industry is the "only" business in America with this total liability protection. We know that it doesn’t have total protection, but do other sectors have something similar? Not the only one The act "is not the first federal law to grant a particular industry immunity from tort liability," said Timothy Lytton, a law professor at Georgia State University, who edited a book on gun industry litigation. Possibly the most analogous rule -- in that it protects a specific group of potential defendants from a specific liability theory -- is one that offers some immunity to online service providers, said John Goldberg, a law professor at Harvard University and an expert in tort law, in an email to PolitiFact. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act blocks victims of online defamation from suing service providers (like Comcast) and content providers (like YouTube) for failing to monitor or remove defamatory posts uploaded by customers. In a prior interview with NPR, Goldberg called the gun industry law particularly "aggressive" in terms of the liability protections granted. Most of the experts we surveyed also mentioned a vaccine manufacturer liability law passed in the 1980s. Under the law, victims of injuries that they say were caused by defective vaccines are not allowed to sue vaccine manufacturers. This differs from the gun legislation, however, because it established the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, through which alleged victims can make a claim and receive compensation. "By contrast, (the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act) simply prohibits certain kinds of tort claims against the gun industry without providing plaintiffs any alternative means of pursuing their claims," Lytton said. There’s also some liability protection in the medical devices and airline industries, noted Walter Olson, senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute and expert in tort law. For example,the 1994 General Aviation Revitalization Act said small aircraft manufacturers cannot be sued for accidents involving aircraft more than 18 years old. "It’s not at all unique to the gun industry. It’s a version (of liability law) Congress developed for an industry that was under very heavy attack," Olson said, referring to the slew of litigation against gun sellers and makers that prompted Congress to pass the law. Our ruling Clinton said the gun industry is "the only business in America that is wholly protected from any kind of liability." Clinton is talking about a law that says the gun industry is protected from liability in certain instances, but the law also specifies several situations in which the gun industry is susceptible to lawsuits. Further, Congress has passed a number of laws that protect a variety of business sectors from lawsuits in certain situations, so the situation is not unique to the gun industry.

pomt-09668	The Senate health care bill "would leave 24 million people without insurance coverage."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/20/mike-enzi/se-mike-enzi-says-senate-health-care-bill-will-lea/	Republican Sen. Mike Enzi, whom Democrats had once hoped to woo for bipartisan support of a health care bill, attacked the version put forth on Nov. 18, 2009, by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. "Like the Pelosi bill, the Reid bill is government-centered, not patient-centered," Enzi said "It’s chock-full of new taxes and higher health care costs that would threaten jobs, weaken our economy, punish families and small businesses trying to make ends meet, and stick our children and grandchildren with the bill." That's all pretty standard fare from Republican opponents of the Democratic health care plans being debated in Congress. But we were intrigued by another criticism leveled by the Wyoming senator, that the Senate bill "would leave 24 million people without insurance coverage." That uninsured figure cited by Enzi comes from an analysis of the Reid bill by the Congressional Budget Office. The report concludes that under the Reid bill, the share of legal nonelderly residents with insurance coverage would rise from about 83 percent currently to about 94 percent. Specifically, the report estimated that the number of nonelderly people who are uninsured would be reduced by about 31 million by 2019, leaving about 24 million nonelderly residents uninsured. So who are those 24 million who would be left uninsured? About a third of them are illegal immigrants, the CBO report states. So who are the other two-thirds (16 million) left uninsured? We asked three health care experts: John Holahan at the Urban Institute; Leighton Ku, a professor of health policy at George Washington University; and Kathleen D. Stoll, director of Health Policy at Families USA. They said those people mostly fall into several main categories: • People who are deemed able to afford health insurance but simply decide the tax penalties are not high enough to persuade them to buy it. Some young, healthy people, for example, may decide it's cheaper to simply pay the tax penalty rather than purchase insurance, Stoll said. The same is true for some wealthy people who are self-insured. "These are basically people who say, 'It's not worth it to me,' " Ku said. • People exempt from tax penalties because the cost of health insurance comes to more than 8 percent of their income, even if they are getting federal subsidies. These are generally people with a lower income, but not so low as to qualify for Medicaid. Without a penalty, many of those people may decide to continue not to buy insurance. "These are people on the lower end of the income scale, but not the poorest of the poor," Ku said, generally people who make anywhere from 133 percent to 300 percent of the poverty level. • People who are eligible for Medicaid, but simply don't sign up. Some people just think it's a hassle to sign up for insurance, even when it's free, Ku said. About 60 percent of people eligible for Medicaid today simply don't sign up, Holahan said. "People with very low incomes don't always know how to navigate a lot of things in life. People don't necessarily value health care, and they don't take the time to fill out the necessary paperwork." • Then there are those who are in transitional stages of life -- perhaps a job change -- and don't take steps to close the insurance gaps between jobs. The CBO report found that the Senate bill was less effective in reducing the number of uninsured compared to the version of the health care bill that passed the House. While the Senate version was estimated to reduce the number of uninsured by 31 million (leaving 24 million uninsured), the House plan was estimated to reduce the number of uninsured by about 36 million, leaving about 18 million uninsured. That's largely because the House tax penalty for not getting insurance is a lot harsher. Under the House bill, people who refuse to purchase health insurance will be hit with a tax penalty equivalent to 2.5 percent of their adjusted gross income. The Senate plan calls for a tax penalty of $95 in 2014, going up to $350 in 2015, $750 in 2016, and graduated up in ensuing years based on inflation adjustments. Given differences between the House and Senate bills that cause the Senate plan to leave more uninsured, we certainly think it's fair for a senator to criticize the plan in that regard. But since this criticism comes from a Republican senator, we would be remiss if we did not point out several other political realities. A CBO analysis of the main Republican health care plan, which was put forward by House Republican leader John Boehner, concluded it would reduce the number of uninsured by only about 3 million people (as opposed to 31 million in the Reid plan). "It has not been a particularly high priority for the Republican Party to expand the number of people who get health insurance coverage," Ku said. Again, a third of the people who would remain uninsured under the Reid plan are illegal immigrants. You may recall that many Republicans criticized Democrats for not taking enough precautions to ensure that illegal immigrants are barred from a public option and also argued that illegal immigrants ought to be prohibited from buying insurance in any government-sponsored health insurance exchange. And the biggest factor accounting for fewer uninsured in the Reid plan, as opposed to the House plan, is that the Senate plan has less severe penalties for those who do not buy insurance. But many conservatives have criticized Democrats for the mandate, arguing that the government ought not get involved in requiring health insurance. Still, the bottom line is that Enzi said the Reid plan would leave 24 million people uninsured, and the CBO confirms that figure. We rate his statement True.

pomt-00381	"When Abraham Lincoln made the Gettysburg Address speech, the great speech, do you know he was ridiculed? He was ridiculed."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/sep/07/donald-trump/was-lincolns-gettysburg-address-initially-ridicule/	Few people would have had "Gettysburg Address" on their bingo card for President Donald Trump’s Sept. 6 rally in Billings, Mont. But Trump did riff on the famous mid-Civil War speech by President Abraham Lincoln. The 273-word address, memorized by countless schoolchildren, was delivered for the dedication of the National Cemetery of Gettysburg in Pennsylvania, at the site of a bloody but pivotal battle in the Civil War. Here’s what Trump said at the rally: "You know, when Abraham Lincoln made the Gettysburg Address speech, the great speech, do you know he was ridiculed? He was ridiculed. "He took the horse and carriage up from the White House, he wrote it partially in that carriage and partially at a desk in the Lincoln Bedroom, which is incredible, by the way, in the White House. And he went up to Gettysburg, and he delivered that speech, the Gettysburg Address. And he was excoriated by the fake news. They had fake news then. He was excoriated. "They said it was a terrible, terrible speech. They said it was far too short. It's not long. Many of us know it by memory. It was far too short, and it was far too flowery. It was too flowery, four score and seven years ago, right? Too flowery. And he died. "Fifty years after his death, they said it may have been the greatest speech ever made in America." Some portions of Trump’s description are inaccurate (the president rode the train to Gettysburg rather than taking a horse and carriage) while others are fairly accurate (he is generally believed to have written a large portion of the speech at the White House before completing it and making revisions after his arrival in Gettysburg). The part that raised our eyebrows is the notion that Lincoln, despite being lionized for his words in subsequent generations, was "ridiculed" for the address at the time. Trump has a point, but the speech’s reception is more complicated than he lets on. The Harrisburg Patriot & Union example Trump may have been thinking of the example of the Harrisburg Patriot & Union, which attracted national attention in in 2013, as the 150th anniversary of the address approached. The paper, located less than an hour away from the battlefield, wrote a scathing account of the speech. About Lincoln’s portion, the newspaper opined, "We pass over the silly remarks of the President. For the credit of the nation we are willing that the veil of oblivion shall be dropped over them and that they shall be no more repeated or thought of." A century and a half later, the newspaper's take officially changed. The Harrisburg Patriot-News and pennlive.com, under the leadership of editorial page editors John L. Micek and Matthew Zencey, ‘fessed up to the paper’s past editorial misstep in a 2013 fashion modeled on Lincoln’s original address: "Seven score and ten years ago, the forefathers of this media institution brought forth to its audience a judgment so flawed, so tainted by hubris, so lacking in the perspective history would bring, that it cannot remain unaddressed in our archives. … No mere utterance, then or now, could do justice to the soaring heights of language Mr. Lincoln reached that day. By today's words alone, we cannot exalt, we cannot hallow, we cannot venerate this sacred text, for a grateful nation long ago came to view those words with reverence, without guidance from this chagrined member of the mainstream media. ... The Patriot-News regrets the error." The newspaper’s self-deprecating retraction went viral, even inspiring a recurring character on Saturday Night Live’s "Weekend Update" -- Jebidiah Atkinson, the unrepentant, arrogant "speech critic" for the 1860s Harrisburg Patriot & Union, played by cast member Taran Killam. (Watch his inaugural SNL appearance, in which Atkinson haughtily disses famous speeches by everyone from Patrick Henry to Jesus.) See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com So one particularly high-profile case backs up evidence for Trump’s remarks in Montana. Was this a common occurrence? The Harrisburg Patriot-News’ negative reaction was not isolated, but it was not unanimous. The poet and historian Carl Sandburg wrote in 1954 that "the American correspondent of the London Times wrote that 'the ceremony was rendered ludicrous by some of the sallies of that poor President Lincoln. ... Anything more dull and commonplace it would not be easy to produce.'" And the Chicago Times wrote, "The cheeks of every American must tingle with shame as he reads the silly, flat, and dishwatery utterances." But others offered high praise indeed. The Chicago Tribune wrote, "The dedicatory remarks by President Lincoln will live among the annals of man." Sandburg reported that the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin wrote that "not many" who read Lincoln’s speech "will do it without a moistening of the eye and a swelling of the heart." And the Providence Journal added, "We know not where to look for a more admirable speech than the brief one which the president made." The key determinant of a newspaper’s positive or a negative review? Politics, historians say. Lincoln was a Republican. "The Patriot was a Democratic organ dedicated to the defeat of Republicans," said William Blair, a Penn State University historian and author of With Malice toward Some: Treason and Loyalty in the Civil War Era. "The Democrats were being increasingly dominated by a peace faction that was calling for an armistice of an indistinct nature but with the possibility of bargaining with the South for reunification while preserving slavery. The Democrats increasingly criticized Republicans for a seeming willingness -- in their eyes -- to waste more and more white lives for the ending of slavery while refusing to consider negotiating to end the war." In other words, Blair said, what seems to modern ears like an apolitical speech appealing to universal values was actually seen at the time as a statement of policy -- in favor of continuing the war, and seeking emancipation. "It was a brilliant speech that pressed forward two important policy measures without seeming to do so," Blair said. "The Patriot’s response was to an extent predictable. Republican newspapers were very supportive" of Lincoln’s speech in the immediate aftermath. Trump does have a point about the address' changing assessment over time, said Eric Foner, a Columbia University historian who specializes in slavery and the Civil War. "The speech definitely was seen as iconic 50 years later but not at the time," Foner said. "A few (newspapers) recognized that this one was really special. But generally, in 1863 Lincoln was much more revered for the Emancipation Proclamation than the Gettysburg Address." Our ruling Trump said, "When Abraham Lincoln made the Gettysburg Address speech, the great speech, do you know he was ridiculed? He was ridiculed." Lincoln was definitely ridiculed by some newspapers, primarily on the basis of politics. Those sympathetic to Democrats and the South blasted it for seeming to support a continuation of the war and the goal of emancipation. It's worth noting that other newspapers -- those whose sentiments aligned with the Union -- lavished the address with praise. The statement is accurate but requires additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-11056	"Burka clad woman runs over baby, gets away with crime for one stunning reason ..."	false	/ohio/statements/2018/jun/26/blog-posting/blog-site-wrongly-claims-muslim-woman-escaped-puni/	A conservative blog falsely claimed that a Muslim woman recently escaped punishment after striking and killing a 7-month-old baby with her car. The problem with that headline? The crash actually occurred June 2, 2016, and the driver received three years in prison and a lifetime suspension on her license, according to local reports. "Burka clad woman runs over baby, gets away with crime for 1 stunning reason," said a June 12, 2018, headline from Daily Headlines, a website offering "unapologetic news (and) commentary from a conservative perspective," according to the about section of its Facebook page. On its website, Daily Headlines said it is neither satire nor "fake news." Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Citing a Nov. 22, 2017, article from America Now, a blog site, the story said a Somali native drove her car off the road and into a house, injuring a man and killing his child in what was her second car accident in four days. The man was walking his son in a stroller. "After 2 car accidents in 4 days, one of which injured a father and took the life of his 7-month old baby before the car drove into a house, a Somali native has been arrested, charged, and convicted of aggravated vehicular homicide and was then let free to roam around until her sentencing hearing," the story said, adding that the woman, Muhuba Mohamed of Columbus, Ohio, was driving on a temporary permit at the time of the accident. But according to local reports from the Columbus Dispatch and others, Mohamed was not set free following the crash. After a judge found her guilty of aggravated vehicular homicide on Oct. 5, 2017, Mohamed surrendered her passport and remained free on bond while she awaited sentencing, which occurred Nov. 29, 2017. Mohamed’s bond was set at $10,000, according to court records. Judges often set criminal defendants free on bond as a means of securing their agreement to return to court for their remaining criminal proceedings. In this case, Mohamed returned to court for sentencing, where she received three years in prison and a lifetime license suspension. So yes, Mohamed was able to "roam around until her sentencing hearing," so to speak. But she surrendered her passport and was bound to return to court by a high bond. She also did not get away with her crime, as the Daily Headlines headline falsely stated. (Daily Headlines did not respond to a request for comment submitted via the contact page on their website.)

pomt-02455	"We’ve got close to 7 million Americans who have access to health care for the first time because of Medicaid expansion."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/feb/25/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-medicaid-expansion-has-brought-h/	After the troubled launch of President Barack Obama’s health care law last fall, the numbers of health insurance sign-ups has increased -- and so has the spin. Speaking at a dinner with the Democratic Governors Association on Feb. 20, 2014, Obama said the law had brought health care to millions of people. He provided a breakdown: "Right now, we’ve already got close to 4 million Americans who have signed up for exchanges. We’ve got 3 million Americans who were able to stay on their parents’ plan because of the law. We’ve got close to 7 million Americans who have access to health care for the first time because of Medicaid expansion. So we’ve already got well over 10 million Americans just in the first few months, despite problems with healthcare.gov in the first month and a half, who suddenly have the financial security that in some cases they’ve never known before." One of these numbers has attracted particular scrutiny -- the "7 million Americans who have access to health care for the first time because of Medicaid expansion." This refers to an expansion under the law of the federal-state Medicaid program. Obama’s law lifted the income limits on who is eligible for Medicaid coverage, newly opening the program to those who had incomes that were very low but still too high to qualify. The federal government would initially pay 100 percent of the cost, with the federal share eventually dropping to 90 percent. In its landmark decision affirming most of the law, the Supreme Court made an exception for the Medicaid provision, saying that states could opt out of the Medicaid expansion. So far, 25 states plus the District of Columbia have decided to expand their Medicaid program, and four more are still considering it. The remaining 21 -- mainly states with Republican political leadership -- have opted out. Our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker gave Obama’s claim the worst rating on their scale -- Four Pinocchios. We thought we’d take a look, too. We asked the White House if it would like to explain Obama’s claim, but the press office did not offer any additional information. (The White House didn’t talk to the Post’s Fact Checker, either.) But we think we have a pretty good idea where the president got his number from -- a report released Jan. 22 by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, titled, "Medicaid & CHIP: December Monthly Applications and Eligibility Determinations Report." According to that report, the cumulative number of individuals determined eligible for Medicaid (or a related but separate State Children’s Health Insurance Program) by state agencies during October, November and December 2013 was a little more than 6.3 million. That’s not 7 million, but it’s approaching that number. However, the report notes some caveats about the 6.3 million figure. The number, according to the report, "includes those newly eligible under the Affordable Care Act and those eligible under prior law and, for some states, renewals." In other words, the number includes people who were already eligible under the old, pre-Obamacare Medicaid rules and "came out of the woodwork," so to speak, during the last three months of 2013. This means they did not suddenly gain "access to health care for the first time" due to Obamacare, which was the standard Obama used in his speech to the governors’ group. The number also includes some people who simply renewed lapsed Medicaid coverage -- people who also wouldn’t be getting "access to health care for the first time." So how many people actually got health coverage due to the Medicaid expansion? That’s a tougher nut to crack, because the data is scattered among different states and different categories. Two private-sector efforts to estimate the number produced divergent figures. Charles Gaba, a website developer and blogger in Michigan, has been tracking enrollment figures at his ACASignups.net site. His most recent estimate from late February shows 2.6 million Medicaid sign-ups once you subtract those falling into three categories -- those who signed up in states that didn’t expand Medicaid, those who were previously eligible and who "came out of the woodwork" to sign up, and an estimate of the typical "churn" for Medicaid sign-ups in those states. Meanwhile, Avalere, a health-care consulting firm, concluded that over the three-month period, between 1.1 million and 1.8 million people newly enrolled for Medicaid due to Obamacare. Avalere developed its estimates in part by comparing the CMS data on new enrollments to enrollment rates from the summer of 2013. The idea is to see how much of a "bump" in enrollments materialized due to the Medicaid expansion. There’s a significant difference between 1.1 million and 2.6 million, but the important factor for our fact-check is that both numbers are well short of Obama’s 7 million figure (and CMS’ 6.3 million figure). Our ruling Obama said, "We’ve got close to 7 million Americans who have access to health care for the first time because of Medicaid expansion." Obama’s 7 million figure was a stretch even compared to his own administration’s 6.3 million figure. But more problematic is a disconnect between what he said and what the administration data is showing. The administration’s 6.3 million figure includes a lot of the "churn" in Medicaid that has nothing to do with the new law’s Medicaid expansion, as well as new sign-ups of people who were previously eligible for Medicaid -- and thus were not granted "access to health care for the first time because of Medicaid expansion," in Obama’s words. The actual number is estimated to be between one-seventh and two-fifths of what Obama said it was. We rate the claim False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2014-02-25T18:26:20	2014-02-20	['None']
pomt-03561	Says Sam Houston opposed slavery and as governor said Texas should not leave the union over slavery.	half-true	/texas/statements/2013/may/22/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-sam-houston-opposed-slavery-and-sa/	As the Texas-headquartered Boy Scouts of America moved closer to a vote on allowing openly gay members, Texas Gov. Rick Perry revisited his opposition to such a change, while calling for leadership that hews to principles even when they are unpopular. Speaking May 6, 2013, via video as part of the national, conservative Family Research Council’s "Stand With Scouts Sunday" webcast, Perry cited the example of Sam Houston, Texas’ first president and seventh governor, whose portrait hung behind Perry on a wall in the Governor’s Mansion. "From this library that I speak, he made a powerful decision that cost him his governorship," Perry said. "He was against slavery, and he stood up and very passionately said, you know, ‘Texas does not need to leave the Union over this issue of slavery. We need to stay. We’ve only been’ -- he thought, a terrible decision. He was right. But it cost him his governorship." That’s "the kind of principled leadership" we need today, said Perry, a former Eagle Scout who wrote a 2008 book defending the organization’s "American values" and saying it was the object of an anti-religious "cultural war" being waged to force the inclusion of gays, agnostics and atheists. His comments touched off an Internet flurry of debate over whether opposing slavery could or should be equated with opposing gay admission, but we wondered about the underlying facts. Did Sam Houston, the leader of Texas’ military insurrection against Mexico, oppose slavery and say Texas shouldn’t split from the United States over it? Houston did lose his job as governor over secession, ending a career of representing Texans in elected office almost continuously from the Texas Revolution to the start of the Civil War. The military hero of San Jacinto became the first president of the Republic of Texas in 1836; then a representative in the Republic’s legislature; president a second time; U.S. senator when Texas became a state in 1845; and, finally, governor starting in 1859. But Texas’ secession convention removed Houston as governor March 18, 1861, after he refused to sign an oath of loyalty to the Confederate States of America. Historians have written that Houston’s views on secession had earlier cost him his seat in the U.S. Senate. As a senator, according to the Texas State Historical Association’s Handbook of Texas, Houston angered pro-slavery factions by voting in 1848 to prohibit slavery in Oregon; supporting the delicately balanced slavery/anti-slavery decisions in the Compromise of 1850; and opposing, in 1854, the Kansas-Nebraska Act that let territories decide their own slavery status, repealing previous law that banned slavery north of latitude 36°30'. What guided Houston’s thinking in these disputes was his belief in the "glorious Union" he had worked hard to get Texas into. The Handbook says, "As senator, Houston emerged as an ardent Unionist ... a stand that made him an increasingly controversial figure. He stridently opposed the rising sectionalism of the antebellum period and delivered eloquent speeches on the issue." Perry spokesman Josh Havens referred us to the 2004 biography "Sam Houston," in which author James Haley described Houston the politician as treading a fine line on slavery for decades: "He disliked it," Haley wrote, but "recognized it as a fact of life to be dealt with." Via email, Haley told us, "Gov. Perry is right that Houston was against slavery, but as a Southern senator he was chained to it and could not openly oppose it." Haley pointed us to a key speech by Houston on slavery, delivered Feb. 22, 1855, in Boston, in which the senator said the Union should not be sundered for "political opinions," that slavery was natural to the Southern economy and that the North would still have slaves if it were profitable there. Emancipation, Houston said, would cast the freed man into jobless destitution: "You might call him free, but he would be an object of want and wretchedness." Haley wrote, "To Sam Houston, what was paramount at that time, and in that place, and during that crisis was keeping the Union together." Houston’s personal views on slavery are unclear. He was a slaveowner; according to his biography online at Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, an inventory of his property upon his death in 1863 listed "12 slaves valued at $10,530.20." Yet "almost all acts other than his ownership of slaves support the idea that he disagreed with slavery as an institution," the university biography said. Among examples given: "While in office as president of the Republic of Texas and later as governor, he refused to permit payments to bounty hunters of escaped slaves. He also prohibited slave ships from trafficking in Texas." One of Houston’s slaves recalled hearing him speak against the institution on the day Abraham Lincoln was elected president. In the 1940 memoir "My Master," Jeff Hamilton said, "I heard the General say that slavery was a damnable thing at best, and that he didn’t believe in human slavery nor in secession or disunion either. He said he hoped God might in some way perform a miracle as of old and save the country from destruction." After Houston had helped shepherd Texas into the United States, he spoke publicly and often against ripping the Union apart over slavery. His pro-Union views and Senate votes made him anathema in Southern politics. His Senate career, the Handbook of Texas says, "was effectively ended when, in 1855, the Texas Legislature officially condemned his position on the Kansas-Nebraska Act," which Houston opposed "because it allowed the status of slavery to be determined by popular sovereignty, a concept he saw as potentially destabilizing to the nation." Somewhat of a lame-duck senator, Houston returned to Texas and ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1857. Opponent Hardin Runnels advocated reopening the slave trade with Africa, which Houston had called an "unholy and cruel traffic" as Texas’ president. Houston was portrayed as a traitor to the South; the press accused him of "voting against all bills in the interest of slavery," according to a July 1914 analysis in the Southwestern Historical Quarterly that summed up his defeat: "The people had not yet forgiven Houston for his support of the Kansas-Nebraska bill." Before leaving Washington for good, Houston defended his Kansas-Nebraska vote in March 19, 1858, remarks to the Senate: "I was not the enemy of slavery, nor was I its propagandist, nor will I ever be." Houston ran for governor again as a pro-slavery candidate, according to T.R. Fehrenbach’s 2000 "Lone Star: A History Of Texas And The Texans": In 1859, Houston, now past his sixty-fifth year, determined to appeal to the people once again. His platform was clear: he supported slavery, he supported the Constitution, but he pledged allegiance to the Union, come what may. It was not a popular platform, but Houston could not believe that the Texans were prepared to forsake the greater nation he had done so much to build. From the gubernatorial pulpit, Houston kept arguing against secession on practical grounds. In a Sept. 22, 1860, speech in Austin, Houston said slavery was not threatened if Southern states stayed in the Union: "We still have the institution of slavery. All the legislation on the subject for the past twenty years has been to secure it to us, so long as we may want it." Civil war would destroy the Southern states, he said, and there was no need for secession: "Are our rights invaded and no government ready to protect them? No! Are our institutions wrested from us and others foreign to our taste forced upon us? No! … if the battle is to be fought for the Constitution, let us fight it in the Union and for the sake of the Union." The institution of slavery "is our own," Houston said, "and the North has nothing to do with it. The North does not want it, and we have nothing to do with that. … We have the right to abolish slavery -- they have the right to establish it. It is in our interest to have it. Climate, soil, association -- all make the institution peculiarly suited to us. If it were to their interest, the people of the North would have it." In a Nov. 14, 1860, open letter to residents of Huntsville who wrote to seek his advice on secession, Houston said a revolution should not be launched without "some more weighty reason for overthrowing the Government, than rash enthusiasts have yet given." As Texas moved toward secession, Houston told the Legislature in a Jan. 21, 1861, message that the slave states should be able to keep their rights, but "hasty" action could be disastrous for cash-strapped Texas. "The millions now spent by the United States, the support of our postal service, the defense of our commerce, must all come from the pockets of our people." Houston’s appeals failed, but Lincoln was impressed by his courage and according to the Texas State Library’s web site "made secret contact with him through intermediaries, offering the old general command of 50,000 troops and the rank of major general if he would lead a force to restore federal control of Texas." Houston turned down the offer in a March 29, 1861, letter; some accounts say he sat up late into the night discussing the question with friends in the mansion’s library and then dropped Lincoln’s offer into the fire. We asked Havens for reaction to our findings, and asked whether the Lincoln offer or another event was the "powerful decision" Perry had referred to. Haley’s book mentions a "family tradition" that says Houston paced the mansion’s floors all night before refusing to sign the Confederate oath. Havens said, "Gov. Perry was referencing Gov. Houston’s strength of character, standing up for what he believed was right in the face of public opposition. There were a collection of events that occurred over that period of time, including burning Lincoln’s letter in the mansion library, when Houston was pondering an issue that would not only shape the fate of our state, but also his personal future." Houston did not live to see the war’s end; he left Austin to return to Huntsville, where he died of pneumonia on July 26, 1863, at age 70. Our ruling Perry said his long-ago predecessor "was against slavery, and he stood up and very passionately said, you know, ‘Texas does not need to leave the Union over this issue of slavery.’ " Houston’s personal views are unclear; politically, he took actions that were viewed as anti-slavery as well as actions that were pro-slavery. But he did exhort Southerners and his fellow Texans not to secede over slavery -- an unpopular stance he stuck to in hopes of preserving the Union he revered. We rate Perry’s statement as Half True.

pomt-12504	Says Texas House rules authorized by the Texas Constitution supersede the state law permitting anyone to record a public government meeting.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2017/apr/27/charlie-geren/mostly-true-texas-house-can-supersede-state-law-pe/	State troopers arrested a Texas woman after she persisted in shooting video of a legislative hearing in keeping with a decades-old state law. That law says: "A person in attendance may record all or any part of an open meeting of a governmental body," including legislative panels. Amy Hedtke, a 2017 Waxahachie school board candidate and self-described anarchist, streamed on Facebook Live a portion of the March 22, 2017, hearing of the House State Affairs Committee in a building on the Capitol grounds. Hedtke transmitted the live video, we confirmed, despite the panel’s chairman, Rep. Byron Cook, announcing at the hearing’s outset that anyone making a recording who lacked media credentials would be asked to leave. According to a March 22, 2017, Texas Department of Public Safety statement provided by the agency at our inquiry, Hedtke, 42, was removed "after she ignored repeated requests by the House Sergeant-at-Arms to stop recording/live video streaming during the meeting. Signs posted in the meeting room prohibit such action without proper media credentials." Anthony Holm of Austin, who brought Hedtke's removal to our attention, noted an April 2017 news report about Hedtke by WFAA-TV, Channel 8 in Dallas. Hedtke’s removal was reported earlier by the Waxahachie Daily Light. Holm asked that we look into whether officials had the authority to act against someone simply taping a hearing as the open-meetings law permits. Our initial inquiries led us to the House's legal explanation in a letter from a House leader, Rep. Charlie Geren, R-Fort Worth, to the TV station that essentially said House rules in keeping with a state constitutional provision let members rule their proceedings regardless of conflicting laws. And is that accurate? A House chairman's explanation Hedtke’s video plus video shot by another person show her refusing requests that she stop taping and being carried by troopers to a DPS sedan. By phone, Hedtke later told us that she was then taken to the Travis County Jail where she was charged with criminal trespass for failing to depart when asked; a court hearing, she said, is scheduled for May 2017. Hedtke’s video from the hearing shows Hedtke telling an unidentified House aide: "State law says that open meetings, you cannot prohibit attendees from recording." The aide replies: "The rules of the House have precedence over that — the Constitution, as well." Geren, chairman of the powerful House Administration Committee, said the same in his April 11, 2017, letter to the TV station, which we fielded by email after asking Jason Embry, a spokesman for House Speaker Joe Straus, why Hedtke was stopped from recording and carried out. Geren's letter says the station’s news account mistakenly indicated the law allowing individuals to record government meetings prevails over House rules giving members control of its proceedings. Constitutional provision and House rules Article III, section 11 of the Texas Constitution, Geren wrote, "authorizes each house of the legislature to determine the rules of its own proceedings." In its entirety, the section says: "Each House may determine the rules of its own proceedings, punish members for disorderly conduct, and, with the consent of two-thirds, expel a member, but not a second time for the same offense." Geren, chairman of the House Administration Committee, further wrote that the House’s 2017 rules deem those rules to be "the only requirements binding" on the 150-member body. Correct: House rules adopted by members at the start of the 2017 legislative session open: "Pursuant to and under the authority of Section 11, Article III, Texas Constitution, and notwithstanding any provision of statute, the House of Representatives adopts the following rules to govern its operations and procedures. The provisions of these rules shall be deemed the only requirements binding on the House of Representatives under Section 11, Article III, Texas Constitution, notwithstanding any other requirements expressed in statute." We asked Geren if he wished to elaborate on his letter, which WFAA-TV subsequently excerpted in a note preceding a web version of its story; he did not. In the latest House rules themselves, meantime, we didn’t spot any provision that a House member can obviate the open-meetings law including its provision that people can record meetings. Otherwise, the rules require the House to post video of public meetings and specify that permission to make live or recorded television, radio, or Internet broadcasts in or from the House chamber when the House is in session may be granted only by the administration committee. Murky? Section 551.023 of Texas’s government code, part of the open-meetings law that came to be in 1973, says: "A person in attendance may record all or any part of an open meeting of a governmental body by means of a recorder, video camera or other means of aural or visual reproduction." But, the law says, a governmental body "may adopt reasonable rules to maintain order at a meeting, including" rules relating to the location of recording equipment and how the recording is made. The law also says those rules "may not prevent or unreasonably impair a person from" recording during a meeting. So, what gives? Angling to sort this out, and with help from Kelley Shannon of the Freedom of Information Foundation of Texas, we queried Austin attorneys steeped in Texas open government laws. Each one agreed that no court has ruled on the ability of the House or Senate to invoke the constitutional provision about the bodies setting internal rules to bypass the permission spelled out in the Texas Open Meetings Act for people to record meetings. Likewise, we found no sign of any such court interpretation when we reviewed materials available at the Texas State Law Library. The lawyers diverged, though, on whether Geren’s explanation holds up. "It gets murky," said David Donaldson of Austin, a retired lawyer whose past clients include the Austin American-Statesman, one of the newspapers that sponsors PolitiFact Texas. By phone, Donaldson added: "The answer may be that we don’t know the answer yet." Over the course of a couple days, Donaldson told us, he was swayed by conflicting arguments both for and against a person being able to record a legislative meeting. Bob Heath, who has advised lawmakers in the past, and Buck Wood, who helped write the open-meetings law, each said the constitution’s language supports what Geren told the station. To his chagrin, Wood said by phone, House members reinforced such a stance by adopting the provision leading its rules stating the body’s rules shall be deemed the "only" requirements binding on the House, regardless of state laws. In contrast, attorneys Bill Aleshire and Jennifer Riggs each suggested a portion of the open-meetings law signals an overarching legislative commitment to complying with the open-meetings law. Section 551.003 of the state’s Government Code states: "In this chapter, the legislature is exercising its powers to adopt rules to prohibit secret meetings of the legislature, committees of the legislature, and other bodies associated with the legislature, except as specifically permitted in the constitution." By email, Aleshire maintained that the section protects the open-meetings law from being preempted by lawmakers any which way. He noted also that the Constitution doesn’t say the Legislature has the power to outlaw recordings. Another hearing, another approach While checking this claim, we noticed that days after troopers carried Hedtke out, a different House chairman, Rep. Phil King, R-Weatherford, let people at a hearing, including Hedtke, take pictures and shoot video. According to House-posted video, just after the start of the March 28, 2017, meeting of the Homeland Security & Public Safety panel, King said: "We want to talk a little bit about cameras and things like that. I’m going to be a little flexible there." King directed anyone taking photos to do so from the back of the Capitol hearing room. "The rule of the day," he said, "is don’t disturb other people when you do it." Hedtke told us, and King confirmed, that she later got King’s permission to move her camera closer to the front of the room; intermittent noise from the hallway was marring her recording from the back. King, asked why he laid out guidelines for people to record the meeting, told us he recognized before the hearing that people following issues before the panel wanted to record or livestream. By phone, King said he’s aware of the law that says anyone can record a government meeting. Yet, he said, his decision to let people take photos or video was based on his discretion under House rules to run the hearing as the committee’s chairman. King said it’s the duty of any chair "to make sure the meeting is smooth, efficient and not disrupted." How did the permission to record affect the hearing? "It was fine," King told us. "Everybody behaved themselves." Our ruling Geren wrote that House rules authorized by the Texas Constitution supersede the state law permitting anyone to record an open government meeting. We find that a constitutional provision plus sweeping House-adopted language that arguably lets the body operate without regard to any law support the chairman's statement. But it's also worth clarifying that the rub with the 1973 law allowing anyone to record a government meeting has yet to be dissected by a court. We rate the claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. UPDATE, 12:20 p.m. May 25, 2017: On May 25, 2017, a Travis County state district judge sided with Hedtke, issuing a temporary order requiring Cook to let Hedtke take photographs and video-record hearings that Cook chairs. See the Austin American-Statesman's news story on the ruling here. This action wouldn't bear on our past rating of Geren's statement in that the judge acted after Geren made his claim.

pomt-05746	"We supported the first new nuclear power plant in three decades."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2012/mar/02/barack-obama/obama-says-he-supported-first-nuclear-power-plant-/	Countering Republican attacks on gas prices, President Barack Obama gave a hard-hitting speech on energy policy in Miami on Feb. 23, 2012. In his speech, Obama laid out a defense of his oil-related policies and reiterated his commitment to diverse energy sources. One of his speech’s shortest lines caught our attention: "We supported the first new nuclear power plant in three decades." Thirty years -- really? And why has it been so long? To satisfy our curiosity, we decided to check it out. (We fact-checked Obama’s claims about drilling in a separate report.) If you haven’t been keeping tabs on the nuclear energy industry, it has indeed been awhile since a new reactor was built. But Obama’s 30-year claim hinges on licensing. On Feb. 9, 2012, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved a license for two new nuclear reactors in Georgia. The electricity giant Southern Co. intends to build them at its Vogtle site south of Augusta. (The White House pointed us to news coverage of the approval when we asked for evidence of Obama’s statement.) Prior to this year, the last time the commission granted a license to build a new reactor was in 1978, which was 34 years ago, according to a commission spokesperson. The permit was for the Shearon Harris plant operated by Carolina Power & Light near Raleigh, N.C. But it takes a long time to build nuclear reactors, so the plant didn’t get operational approval until 1986. And the North Carolina plant isn’t the most recent to go operational. That distinction goes to the Tennessee Valley Authority’s Watts Bar site in Tennessee. It received a construction license in 1973 and an operating license in 1996, or 16 years ago. Still, as we ran this claim by people who watch the nuclear industry closely -- both those opposed to nuclear energy and those in favor of it -- they agreed Obama’s claim to have "supported the first new nuclear power plant in three decades" was largely accurate. A technical note: The Georgia project adds two reactors to an existing electricity generation site with two existing reactors. We wondered if that diminished the accuracy of Obama’s statement, but the experts said it’s fair to call each reactor its own "power plant." Nuclear’s long wait So why has it been so long since a license was granted? Interestingly, the experts we spoke with said it’s not because of bureaucratic hassles or super-stringent rules. Rather, it’s because building new plants is expensive, and the dynamics of the energy market haven’t made new reactors a good deal for energy producers. The Nuclear Information and Resource Service opposes nuclear energy as "dangerous, dirty and expensive," said executive director Michael Mariotte. It’s the expensive part that’s made for the long wait, he said. Energy companies have struggled to build plants in a cost-efficient manner, and the Georgia plants are a long way from being finished, he said. The Southern Co. is trying to construct two reactors at once, which makes for more operational complexity. "If history repeats itself, then they won’t get built. We’ll have to see how much the industry has learned in the past three decades in terms of managing construction costs," he said. His group is part of a lawsuit to stop the construction, on the grounds that the reactor designs need to be updated with lessons learned from the recent nuclear disaster near Fukushima, Japan. (The Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the license on a 4-1 vote; the dissenting vote was cast for that reason.) A sunnier take on the three-decade wait is that the nuclear industry has been really good at innovating and getting more electricity out of its existing plants. That’s what Steve Kerekes of the pro-nuclear Nuclear Energy Institute told us. "From essentially a static number of facilities -- a little over 100 --we’ve increased our electricity output roughly 40 percent. That’s the equivalent of nearly 30 new reactors since 1990, and we’ve done that from existing facilities," he said. Nuclear executives say they would build more plants if the current energy markets were different. The Georgia plant is going forward in a state where regulations allow utilities to bill customers for construction costs before the plant is finished. By way of contrast, the Illinois-based nuclear energy company Exelon operates in many states where that’s not the case. Exelon executives have said plainly it makes little economic sense for them to build new plants, citing two more factors. First, natural gas prices are very low. Second, Congress has abandoned plans to address global warming through a cap-and-trade system or other attempts to limit carbon emissions from coal-fired electricity generation. Both those things work against the business case for building new reactors. (Exelon executives, by the way, donated to Obama’s 2008 campaign, as we noted in this fact-check.) The administration’s support Obama said in his speech that his administration "supported" the new nuclear plants. Again, experts agreed this was so, particularly since the administration is in final negotiations to support the Southern Co.’s construction with $8.33 billion in federal loan guarantees. Back in February 2010, when the project received conditional approval, Obama himself praised the deal, connecting it to the need for climate change legislation. "To meet our growing energy needs and prevent the worst consequences of climate change, we need to increase our supply of nuclear power, and today’s announcement helps to move us down that path," he said. Our ruling Obama said, "We supported the first new nuclear power plant in three decades." He is right that it’s been that long since a new nuclear reactor has been licensed. However, because it takes so long to construct nuclear power plants, the most recent plant actually opened in 1996. The experts we spoke with, both those who support nuclear power and those who oppose it, said that Obama’s statement was largely accurate, given that the last time a nuclear reactor received federal approval was 1978. And, his administration has so far supported the recent approval of new reactors in Georgia with $8.3 billion in federal loan guarantees. We rate Obama’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-08140	"In Florida, illegal immigration costs taxpayers nearly $4 billion (a year). This amounts to $700 for every household in Florida."	false	/florida/statements/2010/dec/06/vern-buchanan/vern-buchanan-says-illegal-immigration-costs-flori/	Sarasota-area congressman Vern Buchanan, a Republican who many think could run for the Senate in 2012, released a video Dec. 2, 2010, arguing against the DREAM Act -- a controversial piece of immigration legislation that would create a path to citizenship for youths brought to the United States illegally. The minute-long video included some sobering figures on the cost of illegal immigration to Florida taxpayers. "In Florida, illegal immigration costs taxpayers nearly $4 billion. This amounts to $700 for every household in Florida," Buchanan said. "Incredibly, some in Congress are still trying to pass a law to grant amnesty. The so-called DREAM Act would grant amnesty to as many as 2 million illegal immigrants. Amnesty rewards people who break our laws and encourages more illegal immigration." PolitiFact just recently ruled False the claim that the DREAM Act would grant amnesty to as many as 2 million illegal immigrants, noting that the 2 million figure is the number of people who would be potentially eligible for citizenship. It's also a matter of debate whether the path to citizenship can be called amnesty. You can read that analysis here. The Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act would allow children brought to the United States by illegal immigrants to obtain permanent legal status if they complete two years of college or enlist in the military. There are currently several versions of the DREAM Act kicking around in Congress, but under the version introduced in March 2009, people under 35 who arrived in the United States before the age of 16 and have lived here at least the last five years would be able to apply for legal permanent resident status on a conditional basis if they have obtained a U.S. high school diploma or GED. That conditional status would be upgraded to permanent after six years if they successfully complete at least two years of college or military service and if they maintain "good moral character." In this item, we wanted to check Buchanan's figures on the cost to taxpayers. Buchanan's press secretary, Sally Tibbetts, said the number comes from a 2009 study by the group the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR). It is a group that opposes the DREAM Act and advocates against congressional action that includes amnesty for illegal immigrants, or a path to citizenship. The group also wants to reduce legal immigration to the United States. The FAIR study examined projected government spending on education, health and incarceration for illegal immigrants and found that illegal immigrants cost Florida taxpayers $3.8 billion. To determine the "cost" of illegal immigration to Florida, FAIR identified the average cost of government services according to, in many instances, other private studies, and then multiplied those figures by the number of illegal immigrants in the population. One of the problems with that kind of analysis, however, is that there's no official number of illegal immigrants living in Florida (illegal immigrants being a group that aren't exactly eager to raise their hands and be counted, after all). For example, FAIR ranked Florida's illegal immigration population fourth in the nation, with an estimated 950,000 immigrants in 2008. In contrast, the Department of Homeland Security ranks Florida third in the nation, with 720,000 illegal immigrants in 2009. But that's not the only problem. The FAIR report tries to identify spending on illegal immigrants in three different areas -- education, health care and incarceration. Of the $3.8 billion estimate, the lion's share -- $3.4 billion -- is spent on education. FAIR uses estimate after estimate to create a "fact." The group used its estimate of the illegal immigrant population in Florida to craft an estimate of illegal immigrant school-aged children -- a number they peg at about 146,000. Then, they use another estimate, a per-pupil figure from the National Center for Education Statistics of $8,234, to say that K-12 illegal immigrant children cost Florida taxpayers "at least $1.2 billion per year." Then, they create another estimate for the sons and daughters of illegal immigrants who were born in the United States -- and thus are American citizens. That number, they say, is 204,000. Add the cost for them in (an estimate) and you get an additional $1.7 billion in cost per year, or $2.9 billion combined. We admit, we can't offer you better estimates for the number of illegal immigrant schoolchildren or the number of legal sons and daughters of illegal immigrants -- because those numbers don't exist. But we can tell you, for instance, that the Florida Department of Education says its per pupil spending is $6,871, not $8,234. And if you use the state number, and not the one from the National Center for Education Statistics, the total cost is $2.4 billion not $2.9 billion. That's $500 million saved by using a different, and at least as reputable figure -- without even dealing with the other estimates, mind you. The remaining education funding, about $566 million FAIR figures, comes from teaching English language instruction for non-native English speakers. FAIR estimates that 80 percent of all children in English language training, a number they estimate to be around 250,000, are the children of illegal immigrants. They multiply that number by another estimate -- they say the amount of additional cost for these students is $2,264 -- to reach a taxpayer cost of $566 million. More estimates on top of estimates. FAIR bases its health care costs on a 2002 Florida Hospital Association survey that found unreimbursed emergency medical care for illegal immigrants topped $40 million. But the survey includes responses from private hospitals that are not funded by the state. So the cost to taxpayers is overestimated. And FAIR produces the state's incarceration costs for illegal immigrants based on the state Department of Corrections' "illegal alien" count of inmates. However, no such count exists. Instead, the state keeps tabs on all inmates who are not U.S. citizens, whether they're in the country legally or illegally. While many of those inmates are eventually released to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for further immigration processing, including possible deportation, the state does not track whether its inmates are legal U.S. residents. (We covered some of this ground already in a fact check from June about this same FAIR study). "I would take FAIR's numbers with a big shaker of salt," said Daniel Griswold, director of the Center for Trade Policy Studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian Washington, D.C., policy group. "The organization exists to portray immigrants in a bad light." One of the easiest ways to see just how malleable the numbers are is to look at FAIR's 2010 state-by-state report. In 2010, FAIR said illegal immigrants cost Florida taxpayers almost $5.5 billion -- that's about a $1.7 billion or 44 percent increase in a year. Nothing that we've discussed, for the record, accounts for the money illegal immigrants pay in state sales taxes and federal income taxes. All people are required to pay state sales taxes. And while some illegal immigrants are paid cash under the table, many are paid by payroll check just like everyone else. Recent estimates suggest illegal workers are now paying $9 billion to $12 billion a year into Social Security through payroll taxes, for instance, with no legal way to get that money back in retirement benefits. (Illegal immigrants provide faked documentation and fake Social Security numbers). So while there is a cost, there also is a revenue side to the equation. In 2009, FAIR said illegal immigrants contributed $1.6 billion in taxes in Florida. In 2010, the number dropped more than $1.3 billion, to $261 million. Eric Ruark, FAIR's director of research, said the group greatly overestimated the amount of disposable income of illegal immigrants that would be subject to sales tax. In defending the study, Ruark notes that FAIR does not estimate the increased tax payments that Florida would gain from having legal workers replace illegal ones, or the cost to the state in payments to Floridians who are unemployed because of the presence of illegal workers in the labor force. The point is, the actual cost could be higher. The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress, tried back in December 2007 to quantify the fiscal impact of illegal immigrants on state and local governments. It couldn't, and found problems with studies that did. The CBO noted that illegal immigrants who just arrive in the United States might use more government resources than those well or better integrated into American society, that it is difficult to capture all revenues and costs, and that there is little information on how much illegal immigrants contribute to American life through taxes, or how much they utilize government services. Instead, the CBO made a series of more general findings. Among them: * State and local governments incur costs for providing services to unauthorized immigrants and have limited options for avoiding or minimizing those costs. * The amount that state and local governments spend on services for unauthorized immigrants represents a small percentage of the total amount spent by those governments to provide such services to residents in their jurisdictions. * The tax revenues that unauthorized immigrants generate for state and local governments do not offset the total cost of services provided to those immigrants. To us, that's a more appropriate and tempered analysis. A quick side note: In his comments, Buchanan said the per-household cost of for illegal immigrants is $700 a year. To get there, Buchanan again uses FAIR, which divided their cost figure for taxpayers ($3.8 billion) by the number of households headed by native-born residents (5.65 million). FAIR excludes households headed by non-native-born residents regardless of whether those heads of household are citizens or living in the United States legally. If they included all households (7 million), the cost per household would be about $550. We're unclear why FAIR, for instance, excluded citizens not born in the United States as well as legally documented residents -- who are all paying taxes -- from their calculations. Let's review. Buchanan said: "In Florida, illegal immigration costs taxpayers nearly $4 billion (a year). This amounts to $700 for every household in Florida." He is mostly quoting accurately from a study performed by the group Federation for American Immigration Reform, though he doesn't cite FAIR in his comments. The FAIR study is highly suspect. It relies on estimate after estimate, and was conducted by a group that is hardly objective when it comes to analyzing the effects of illegal immigration. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office warned specifically against trying to put dollar figures on the costs associated with illegal immigrants because of the large number of unknown variables. We'd consider offering more leeway if Buchanan sourced his statement back to FAIR, so at least people could know the source and question it independently. But Buchanan makes his pronouncement sound like it's fact, when it's far from it. We rate this claim False.	None	Vern Buchanan	None	None	None	2010-12-06T18:42:32	2010-12-02	['Florida']

In television and radio ads he has played the part of playful provocateur, hiring a voice actor to play a pleading facsimile of the president. If you’ve hopped in your car for even a quick lunch break the last few days, you’ve probably heard this ad. However, it’s another Kingston ad that has us at PolitiFact wondering. In a spot titled, "Backward Priorities," Kingston takes aim at federal cuts to the defense budget. "Pres. Obama has it all wrong. He’s growing government with wasteful spending while drastically cutting our military, leaving us with the lowest number of active-duty troops since before World War II," Kingston says in the ad posted on his campaign’s YouTube channel on May 12. "Obama’s backwards priorities puts us all at risk." Kingston goes on to tout his own track record on military bases in Georgia, but this statement made us press the pause button. Is it true that troops are at their lowest since WWII? And if so, are we really at risk? We asked Chris Crawford, Kingston’s campaign spokesman, for the source behind the ad. Crawford forwarded us to a February press release from the Department of Defense, which detailed Pres. Obama’s proposed Pentagon budget for fiscal year 2015. Amidst the cuts were a series of reductions which included "shrinking the Army to its smallest size since before World War II." The proposal would shave off 15 percent of active-duty personnel over five years, from 520,000 to between 440,000 and 450,000. It acknowledged the fiscal reasoning behind the decision, noting cuts made through the Budget Control Act of 2011 ($487 billion over 10 years) and sequestration ($50 billion annually). Right off the bat, Kingston’s ad faces a problem. The 2015 fiscal year budget has a proposed five-year plan for military cuts – it hasn’t actually occurred yet, and will have to be approved by Congress. So Obama has not yet left the country with the lowest number of troops since WWII, even if he has proposed such cuts, though they are likely to go through given the fiscal constraints on the Pentagon. Crawford said this about the budget: "The President’s budget is a formal vision for the country and something behind which he uses the force of the entire federal government. It is a policy statement of the Administration under the President’s leadership. Keep in mind this comes from an administration that doesn’t let that repeatedly oversteps its bounds of executing the law rather than legislating it." But how do the numbers compare with past deployments? The folks at PolitiFact Wisconsin compiled a list of Army figures going back to 1775 while conducting a fact check of similar comments made by Wisconsin Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner. Kingston said active-duty troops will decrease to pre-WWII levels. On first blush, that seems true. That list, citing the Secretary of War Annual Report and Strength of the Army Reports, shows that in 1940, there were 264,118 active-duty troops. In 1941, after the United States joined the war following Pearl Harbor, that number shot up to 1.5 million troops. Kingston’s phrasing could use some fine-tuning. He seems to imply that the number of troops will be around 1940 levels through his comparison. But they are actually much closer to the numbers seen in the late 1990s and even early 2000s. There were only 479,026 active troops in 2000, and from 1998 to 2001, the number stayed close to 480,000. The current numbers are low, but historically speaking, they aren’t that low – especially when considering the nation’s unstable finances .Now for the second question: what risk does a smaller military pose for U.S. citizens? That’s a bit less cut and dry. Center for a New American Security fellow Travis Sharp addressed the issue in a policy brief, noting that the comparison to 1940 was "interesting," but "not particularly useful." "Since the 2014 Army is not going to fight in the 1940 strategic environment," Sharp wrote, "comparing them does not help us decide what to do today." He writes later that size does matter in many combat operations, but that decreasing ground forces in peacetime is "both precedented and logical," given budgetary concerns. For its part, the Defense Department report states that active duty strength will diminish, but will be replaced with continued investments in cyber capabilities, missile defense and nuclear deterrence. We called Ricky Smith, a senior army official and director of the Army Capabilities Integration Center, a military think tank, to get his take about the connection between today’s troops and their 1940 counterparts. "It really is an apples to oranges comparison. The quality of today’s individual soldier is so much higher than it was," Smith said. "What they’re able to do the squad level, versus World War II, is amazing." Smith said the Army should still be able to handle single operations, but might struggle from its diminished force when attempting to fight in multiple arenas, like when U.S. troops fought in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Technology does decrease the need for on-the-ground troops, but those units are also still necessary for the vast majority of tasks. The military’s status as a global force may be lessened by cuts. "You ultimately have to have some kind of human contact," Smith said. "There’s something to be said about putting boots on the ground and having tanks." But that desire is balanced with fiscal realities. "By reducing our capacity, you are in some ways accepting risk," Smith said. "The question is, what is prudent risk?" In short, Kingston accused the Obama administration of reducing active troops to pre-WWII levels and putting "us all" at risk. While it is true that the numbers are at their lowest since 1940, they are substantively similar to the active enrollment numbers seen in the 1990s and early 2000s. Changing technologies and strategies for deployment make the comparison to the pre-Pearl Harbor days a bit of a stretch. The reduction of active troops has a clear effect on the scope of missions the United States can take on globally. But whether citizens at home are seeing a greater risk is less clear. Though Kingston’s ad contains some truth there is a lot of context missing. We rate Kingston’s claim Half True.

pomt-06908	The Atlanta streetcar is expected to create 930 jobs during construction, totaling more than 5,600 jobs over the next 20 years.	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2011/jul/25/federal-transit-administration/fta-says-atlanta-streetcar-create-thousands-jobs/	The familiar clang of the Atlanta Streetcar Project sprang the Truth-O-Meter to action. Leaders fought hard for funds to build the line, which is slated to open in 2013. It will ferry passengers from Centennial Olympic Park to the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site, bringing new jobs and businesses to struggling downtown neighborhoods, they said. The $72 million project scored a crucial $47.6 million federal grant in October, but Republicans in Congress threatened to take the money back. Now, streetcar fans can breathe a sigh of relief. A Federal Transit Administration press release announced July 13 that the money’s finally ready, and construction can begin. The press release trumpeted reasons why the streetcar is good for Atlanta, including this one: "[T]he project is expected to create an estimated 930 jobs during construction and more than 5,600 jobs over the next 20 years." Wait a second. Didn’t the Truth-O-Meter debunk a similar streetcar job creation claim in March? Indeed, Democrat U.S. Rep. John Lewis, who represents the district where the streetcar will be built, said in a newsletter to constituents that building and running the streetcar is projected to create 1,399 jobs -- 460 to run it, and 939 to build it. The newsletter cited figures in the grant proposal that won the streetcar more than $47 million in federal money. Experts and civil servants came up with the numbers and vetted them, so Lewis’ staff thought they were safe to use. They weren’t. We ruled Lewis’ claim False. Those jobs weren’t actual positions. They were "job years." "Job years" means one job lasting for one year. So if a single position lasts five years, it counts as five "job years." But Lewis’ newsletter described the "job years" as "jobs," which would mislead typical readers. People think of "jobs" as actual positions, so constituents would think the streetcar would create more jobs than experts actually estimated. Since the FTA’s recent press release uses the same numbers, its statement has similar problems. The FTA said its 5,600 jobs figure includes the 930 construction jobs, plus those needed to run the streetcar and positions created when new residences and businesses pop up along the route. The agency, like Lewis, got its numbers from Atlanta’s grant application. (The FTA’s 930 construction jobs count is very close to the 939 the grant application used, so we won’t count this difference against the FTA.) The FTA’s press release portrays the construction jobs estimate accurately. It will take about one year to build the streetcar, so for this phase of the project, one job year does equal one actual job. But that doesn’t mean 930 people are projected to build the streetcar line, and the jobs aren’t all for locals. This is the construction phase’s "total employment" figure, which means the number of people who would be employed for construction, plus two other types of jobs created by the project: those to make materials such as steel to construct the line, and those created when workers spend their earnings on a new stereo or a package of cheese puffs. Planners expect to employ 467 workers for streetcar construction. The rest would be making steel, cheese puffs and the like -- often outside the Atlanta area. Now let’s deal with the rest of the jobs cited in the FTA release. These are the posts planners think the project will create over the next 20 years: 460 needed to operate the streetcar, plus about 4,200 created when the line spurs economic growth. When PolitiFact Georgia researched Lewis’ statement, we were unable to come up with enough evidence to evaluate job estimates for when the streetcar brings new business to the neighborhood. But we could evaluate the claim that 460 jobs are needed to operate the streetcar. This number also represents "job years," not actual positions. It will actually take an estimated 23 positions to run the streetcar, lasting over 20 years. In other words, this jobs figure is 20 times too high. How do we rule on the FTA? As we wrote earlier, a typical person thinks of "jobs" as actual positions, not "job years." And while experts may understand that the FTA’s jobs figures do not represent actual jobs, your average citizen would not. In fact, it will take an estimated 467 jobs to construct the line, plus 23 jobs that last 20 years or longer to run the streetcar. Experts think the remaining 4,600 jobs will be for those who produce materials needed to build the line or products workers purchase with their earnings, as well as employees of new businesses the streetcar brings to surrounding neighborhoods. This means that when the Federal Transit Administration announced the streetcar project would "create an estimated 930 jobs during construction," totaling more than 5,600 over the next 20 years, it gave a misleadingly high impression of the actual positions needed to construct and run it. If public officials keep exaggerating the number of jobs created by this project, PoiltiFact Georgia will keep turning up the heat. Pants on Fire.

pomt-06256	Says Mitt Romney has flip-flopped on his support for President Reagan’s policies.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/29/democratic-national-committee/dnc-calls-out-romneys-evolving-affection-reagan/	The Democratic National Committee is beating the flip-flop drum to attack Mitt Romney. A four-minute DNC video ad accuses the Republican presidential candidate of switching positions on a host of issues including President Barack Obama’s job stimulus package, abortion, global warming and health care reform. Another topic on which the DNC says Romney pulled a switcharoo: his support for former President Ronald Reagan. The ad, released Nov. 28, 2011, juxtaposes two clips of Romney talking. In the first, he says, "I was an independent during the time of Reagan-Bush. I’m not trying to return to Reagan-Bush." Next, he’s standing at a podium saying, "The principles that Ronald Reagan espoused are as true today as they were when he spoke them." It’s wrapped up with a clip of Reagan himself chuckling and saying, "There you go again." We’re looking separately at several claims in the ad. Here we ask, is Romney really a flipper when it comes to the Gipper? The video evidence The DNC provided us with a fact sheet laying out the source of each claim in the ad. The first clip of Romney, in which he seemed to be distancing himself from Reagan, comes from a 1994 debate when Romney was challenging the late Edward Kennedy in a race for U.S. Senate. The two were having a mostly philosophical discussion about poverty and families with Kennedy, a liberal Democrat, claiming that child poverty rates rose when Republicans occupied the White House. "Under the Reagan/Bush economic programs, under the economic programs you want to return to, the total number of children that are living in poverty, the total number of children out of wedlock -- this has happened, you know we’ve had Republican presidents during this period of time and the cutting back of support systems for children and most of all for families to get jobs," Kennedy said. "If you’re not going to provide a climate and an atmosphere for men and women to be able to work and provide for their children, you’re going to see the breakdown of the family as well." Kennedy said discussions about supporting families shouldn’t be used to score "political hits," prompting Romney to fire back that he wasn’t politicizing the issue -- Kennedy was. "I mentioned nothing about politics or your position at all. I talked about what I’d do to help strengthen families, and you talked about Reagan-Bush. Look, I was an independent during the time of Reagan-Bush. I’m not trying to return to Reagan-Bush," Romney said, distancing himself from the popular former president. In the second clip, Romney was speaking at the annual Reagan lecture at the Reagan library in Simi Valley, Calif., in May 2010. He was talking about America’s position in the world. "I have to tell you that I’m optimistic. I’m optimistic about the future because I recognize that there is a growing awakening among the American people that this administration has put us on the wrong track and that the principles that Ronald Reagan espoused are as true today as they were when he spoke them." Romney was interrupted by applause, and then continued by elaborating on policies emphasizing low taxes, balanced budgets and strong families. So the two clips are as the DNC presented them in the ad. They are not covertly edited or cut to leave a false impression about what Romney said. But is it a flip flop? The DNC ad is titled "Mitt v. Mitt, The story of two men trapped in one body." It opens with ominous-sounding music and white letters on a black background saying, "He wants to be president" followed by "but what does he really believe?" Then a voice in the background asks, "Who is this guy? Can you trust him?" and the Romney images unfold. The ad’s overt message is that Romney has changed his position on numerous issues, and that makes him an untrustworthy candidate. But the Reagan matter is not so simple as a candidate voting in favor of a concrete issue, then voting against it. We looked and couldn’t find any other references to Romney distancing himself from Reagan, beyond the 1994 debate comment. Prior to 1994, Romney was a businessman, not a politician. It’s true that Romney was not registered with any party for several years in Massachusetts, and in 1992, he voted for former Sen. Paul Tsongas, a liberal Democrat, in the Massachusetts Democratic presidential primary, according to a McClatchy newspapers story. (Romney’s spokesman responded then "that the vote for Tsongas was a vote against Bill Clinton and that not enrolling in either major party was common in Massachusetts.") Later, during his first presidential campaign in 2007, Romney blasted primary rival John McCain for voting against President George W. Bush’s tax cuts. "That's failing Reagan 101," Romney said, holding up Reagan as the standard to which Republicans should aspire. In a debate that year, he was asked whether the primary candidates would support the Republican nominee if it was someone else. Yes, Romney said, then added, "I want that nominee, however, to come out of the same mold as Ronald Reagan." In the 2010 Reagan library address, Romney had more flattering words for the former president. While speaking about the need to keep America strong for the sake of world peace, he paraphrased "that wonderful line" of Reagan’s: "(Reagan) said, ‘of the four wars that were begun during my lifetime, not one of them was begun because America was too strong.’ And he’s absolutely right," Romney said. And again in that speech, Romney approvingly quoted Reagan taking a jab at the left, recalling Reagan’s words, "it isn’t that liberals are ignorant, it’s just that what they know is wrong." Our ruling The DNC ad casts Romney as a flip-flopper on his support for the policies of former President Reagan. In the first clip, Romney in 1994, as a candidate running against a liberal icon in a liberal state, says he’s "not trying to return to Reagan-Bush." Then, 13 years later, he’s speaking approvingly of the former president saying that Reagan’s principles "are as true today as they were when he spoke them." Romney’s affection for Reagan’s presidency has grown warmer over the years and as he appealed to a different electorate. In 1994, Romney needed to win votes from the middle while gunning for the Massachusetts Senate seat. Running for the Republican nomination for president, it’s politically wise for him (and any Republican presidential candidate) to speak glowingly of Reagan. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-12658	"In year No. 1, 14 million Americans lose coverage," according to the CBO.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/22/chris-murphy/house-gop-health-care-bill-would-cause-14-million-/	Democrats continue to hammer Republicans over a health care overhaul that’s projected to set in motion steep drops in insurance enrollment nationwide. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., in a press conference said the "biggest headline" from an analysis of the House bill by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office was that 24 million fewer Americans would be insured by 2026 under the plan, with a big drop off starting next year. "In 2018, right off the bat, right in year No. 1, 14 million Americans lose coverage," Murphy said in a March 16 press conference. "This is because of the cuts to Medicaid, which will result in states dramatically curtailing Medicaid eligibility, but also because lots of Americans who today have private health care through these exchanges won't be able to afford that coverage, as well as people who will come off employer-sponsored care." We decided to fact-check Murphy's claim about the bill, formally called the American Health Care Act, that 14 million Americans would lose coverage. Murphy accurately identified several of the drivers behind the projected rise in the uninsured rate. But he left out that some of the reduced enrollment would result from the repeal of a deeply unpopular provision in the Affordable Care Act—the individual mandate that requires most Americans to get coverage or pay a penalty. 14 million fewer Americans insured next year The CBO report places the anticipated 14 million newly uninsured people into several categories. It projects 5 million fewer people will be covered under Medicaid; 2 million fewer people will be covered through their employer, and 6 million fewer will obtain coverage on the individual market, either through private insurers or exchanges set up under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Murphy accurately characterizes the CBO’s findings on reduced enrollment due to Medicaid. In addition to the 5 million fewer people expected to be covered under Medicaid next year, the CBO projects 14 million fewer people would be enrolled in Medicaid by 2026 as states that would likely expand Medicaid under Obamacare chose not to do so under the Republican proposal. The senator also fairly states the CBO’s conclusion on employer-based insurance. Beyond the roughly 2 million fewer people to get coverage through their employer in 2018, the Republican proposal is estimated to lead to roughly 7 million fewer people enrolled in employer-based insurance by 2026. But Murphy didn’t mention that some of these people would voluntarily drop their insurance. The House Republican health care overhaul would repeal the individual mandate penalty, and according to the CBO, this would be the single biggest driver of raising the uninsured rate by 14 million next year. "Most of that increase would stem from repealing the penalties associated with the individual mandate," the CBO report reads. "Some of those people would choose not to have insurance because they chose to be covered by insurance under current law only to avoid paying the penalties, and some people would forgo insurance in response to higher premiums" (emphasis ours). The CBO could not provide specific figures on how many people would opt out of coverage based solely on the removal of penalties, so it’s difficult to quantify. But there’s reason to think the figure would be significant. A RAND study from 2014 found that repealing the individual mandate would cause a sharp reduction in enrollment—with roughly one in five people in the individual market dropping coverage—while adding only relatively small increases to insurance premiums. Some conditions have changed since the study was published, but these findings seem to suggest millions of people would opt out of coverage if the penalties associated with the individual mandate were eliminated. Suffice it to say that while those people would no longer have coverage, they didn't technically lose it, as Murphy said, so much as voluntarily forgo coverage. And omitting this group as a driver of the projected rise in next year’s projected uninsured rate does not tell the whole story behind the 14 million figure. Keep in mind, the people required to buy insurance helped keep rates reasonable for people who are sick or had pre-existing conditions. Insurance markets set up under Obamacare have depended on a group of younger, healthier people blending into a diverse pool with older, sicker people. This arrangement led to a system where "young and healthy enrollees without large subsidies effectively cross-subsidize older, less healthy enrollees when they are required to purchase insurance or pay a penalty," according to a December CBO report. Our ruling Based on the CBO's analysis of the House Republican health care bill, Murphy said, "In year No. 1, 14 million Americans lose coverage." It is the CBO's estimate that 14 million more Americans would be off the health insurance rolls in the year following the bill’s passage. But Murphy overlooked that some of next year's newly uninsured population never wanted insurance to begin with and only got coverage under Obamacare to avoid tax penalties. This is particularly true of the people who "lose" coverage during the first year -- many of them are people dropping coverage because there is no longer a penalty. We rate Murphy’s statement Mostly True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Chris Murphy	None	None	None	2017-03-22T16:24:02	2017-03-16	['United_States', 'Congressional_Budget_Office']
pomt-15123	"I cut state spending more than anybody (in the 2016 GOP field)."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/09/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-cut-spending/	Jeb Bush, otherwise known as "Veto Corleone" in Florida, says he has the fiscal conservative track record to back up his nickname.

Bobby Jindal, who’s No. 2 in spending cuts according to the chart but No. 14 in the polls, begged to differ and tweeted at Bush with a different chart that shows the former Florida governor was actually the top spender in the field. (Jindal has used this chart to tout his own conservative bonafides before.) .@JebBush may claim to have cut government spending, but FL’s budget grew 52% under his watch https://t.co/BFGM4URs0a pic.twitter.com/VG5NUc6e7t — Gov. Bobby Jindal (@BobbyJindal) September 1, 2015 We were curious about Bush’s claim that he’s the top spending cutter. We found that neither Bush’s chart nor Jindal’s chart is a perfect way to compare state budgets — but Jindal’s chart is less perfect. Bush’s chart The Bush campaign told us his source was a Fox News fact-check that compared the track records of the GOP governors in the race. It looked at changes in state spending, expressed as a percentage change in each state’s budget. Here’s the original chart from Fox: "The chart above shows that Bush cut spending the most. Though he's criticized by conservatives as ‘too moderate,’ the former Florida governor cut spending by an average of 1.39 percent each year he was in office. Most cuts came from ‘public assistance,’ higher education, and state discretionary spending," the fact-check reads. Fox’s data comes from a National Association of State Budget Officers report, which breaks up state spending into four spending pools: general fund (the main fund and typically most flexible), federal funds, other state funds (which includes targeted revenue, such as gasoline taxes for transportation spending), and bonds. According to Brian Sigritz, the association’s director of state fiscal studies, Fox tallied up two of the pools — general fund and other state funds — and adjusted the numbers for inflation and population. We ran Fox’s analysis by a few experts who told us that while it’s a fair analysis, it’s not flawless. (We’ll get to its imperfections later.) On the positive side, taking the different population sizes of different states into consideration is a good start, according to Alan Auerbach, a professor of public finance at the University of California at Berkeley. It’s also fair to leave out federal funds and bonds. David Crane, who researches state fiscal policy at Stanford University, told us he also excludes those categories when crunching the numbers in California’s state budget. "If the goal is to learn if a governor cut spending, why would you include funds provided by a third party?" he said. "(Bonds) are generally issued for infrastructure, not operating costs." Overall, the analysis created a way to measure spending that is mainly under the control of state officials. "It is pretty close to a concept of ‘tax supported spending,’ but still imperfect," said Don Boyd, who analyzes state and local fiscal issues at the Rockefeller Institute of Government. "Overall, based on what Fox said they did, I think they did a pretty good job." Jindal’s chart What about Jindal’s retort? According to his chart, Bush was the top spender out of the eight governors in the 2016 race, and his budget increased by an average of 6.08 percent every year. We noted in a recent fact-check that it’s a more simplistic, and thus more imperfect, way to look at the state budget picture. For one, the analysis does not adjust for inflation. That’s not an issue if you’re comparing the same years for everybody, but the numbers may be distorted when comparing different time periods. (Bush was governor from 1999 to 2007, while Jindal took office in 2008.) "If you're looking at different time periods, inflation surely would have been different and it can't possibly be an accurate reflection of the consequences of policy choices," Boyd said. For another, Jindal’s numbers only consider the general fund. Given that some governors may spend more out of other state funds, just looking at one pool of money makes it more difficult to compare across states, according to Boyd. Limitations all around Experts, however, emphasized that there’s no one way or perfect way to compare budgets across states. "There is not one single measure of state fiscal conditions that we recommend using," said Sigritz of the state budget officers’ association. "There are pluses and minuses with using each indicator." Then there are limitations with the data itself. The association’s numbers are self-reported by the budget offices of each state, which Boyd said may affect the quality of the data. Moreover, the numbers also reflect spending that’s not supported by taxes, such as higher education spending supported by tuition. And because the governors all served at different times, it’s unfair to compare them because they were working with different economic conditions. Bush, for example, governed during an economic boom, and Jindal held office during a recession. "The Bush claim has some merit, but there are additional things one would want to control for — like economic conditions in Florida relative to other states — to get a better picture," said Auerbach. "And, of course, what any governor does depends on the state legislature to a reasonable extent." He and Sigritz both noted that economic downturns have significant impacts on state budgets, and spending usually decreases during recessions. To its credit, Fox tried to address the disparity by comparing each candidate to his contemporaries (i.e. Bush to other governors of the 2000s and Jindal to sitting governors). By that measure, Bush was still the top cutter. Beyond the question of who cut the most spending, experts said we shouldn’t ignore how they did it. "If, for example, a governor cut spending by underpaying pension contributions, or by deferring maintenance on roads and bridges, then look out below," said Boyd. As Fox notes, Bush’s cuts came from public assistance, higher education and state discretionary spending. Much of the reduction under Jindal, reported the Times-Picayune in 2011, is "explained by waning hurricane recovery appropriations and the end of federal stimulus aid." Our ruling Bush tweeted, "I cut state spending more than anybody." He cited a chart by Fox News that experts told us was a valid way of looking at budget reductions. It’s not perfect nor is it the only way to measure spending cuts. Bush’s claim is partially true but leaves out context. We rate it Half True.

pomt-11209	"Two-thirds of the people who use Medicaid are poor children, but two-thirds of the money is for long-term care for seniors, whether in a facility or at home."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/11/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-wrong-medicaids-role-children-elderly/	During an appearance at a fiscal policy summit in Washington, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., delved into who – and what — the Medicaid program pays for. Medicaid, the federal-state program that serves many poor Americans, is one of several mandatory spending programs putting pressure on the federal budget. At roughly 6:48 in this video, Pelosi said, "Two-thirds of the people who use Medicaid are poor children, but two-thirds of the money is for long-term care for seniors, whether in a facility or at home." Is this accurate? No — as Pelosi’s office quickly clarified after PolitiFact inquired. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Pelosi "misspoke," said Henry Connelly, Pelosi’s deputy communications director. Connelly clarified that she should have said that "children are close to half of Medicaid enrollees" and said she "inverted" the statistic about long-term care spending. "It’s not that two-thirds of Medicaid goes to long-term care, it’s that two-thirds of long-term care is paid for by Medicaid," citing data posted by the Alliance for Retired Americans. (To be precise, according to the group, the share of long-term care costs paid by Medicaid was 62 percent in 2015.) Let’s take a closer look at the actual data for age and long-term care spending. Children accounted for 48 percent of Medicaid beneficiaries in 2013, not the two-thirds Pelosi initially said. The percentage may have changed somewhat following the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, but experts said they did not expect there to have been a dramatic shift. Here’s the full breakdown: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com As for long-term care costs as a share of Medicaid spending, it’s quite a bit less than the two-thirds Pelosi cited. In 2016, various types of long-term care accounted for 21.4 percent of all Medicaid spending.

pomt-00896	"The governor must inform the Senate president about his or her absence from the state."	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2015/mar/05/jennifer-horn/nh-republican-party-says-governor-required-notify-/	Gov. Maggie Hassan traveled to private meetings in New York and Washington D.C. Monday, fanning speculation that she may consider a run for U.S. Senate in 2016 to challenge first-term Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte. In recent weeks, the New Hampshire Republican Party has taken aim at Hassan’s out-of-state travel schedule, claiming the New Hampshire Democrat is using the governor’s post as a "political stepping stone" to elevate her political career. Republican party Chairwoman Jennifer Horn filed several right-to-know requests seeking Hassan’s travel itinerary, and suggested that Hassan did not follow "proper protocol" by notifying the Senate President when she left the state. In a letter sent to Hassan’s office, Horn writes that "the governor must inform the Senate president about his or her absence from the state." In response to Horn’s letter, Hassan responded that -- at the time -- she had only traveled outside the state once in 2015, to the border with Maine to attend the groundbreaking for a bridge reconstruction project. She has since traveled out of the state twice more. We wondered, is the governor required to tell the Senate president every time she leaves the state, whether on official business, for vacation or simply to go out for dinner in Boston? State Republican Party spokesman Ryan William pointed to the New Hampshire Constitution, part 2 article 49, which outlines who acts as governor when the office is vacant, and what qualifies as a vacancy. That section states: "In the event of the death, resignation, removal from office, failure to qualify, physical or mental incapacity, absence from the state, or other incapacity of the governor, the president of the senate, for the time being, shall act as governor until the vacancy is filled or the incapacity is removed." The section furthers outlines when the powers of the governor are transferred as a result of an absence from the state in its concluding sentence: "While the governor or an acting governor is absent from the state on official business, he shall have the power and authority to transact such business." In other words, under Article 49, the only time gubernatorial authority would fall to the Senate President due to the governor’s absence would be when the governor is away on unofficial business, such as a private vacation, said Martin Gross, senior counsel at the law firm Sulloway & Hollis and an expert in New Hampshire constitutional matters. So, if Hassan leaves, is she required to notify Senate President Morse? The Constitution doesn’t directly spell it out. Williams says it’s good practice, for the safety of the state. "It’s important for Gov. Hassan to inform Senate President Morse when she is out of state. If she doesn't, he has no way to know he is acting governor (and) that would put the state at risk," Williams said. Still, good practice is not the same thing as a requirement. This is not a new issue; it has come up in state politics from time to time. The state attorney general’s office has rendered opinions on whether the governor is required to notify the senate president of an absence. "While there are instances when notice has been formerly given in the past, it is not mandated by the Constitution, which is wholly silent on the issue," wrote Attorney General Stephen Merrill in 1987. However, Merrill noted, the intention of the Constitution was to have an automatic transfer of powers. "Since the executive power must be kept functioning at all times, there can be no possibility of the gap which would occur while the Senate President awaits a notice from the governor," Merrill wrote. And Merrill added, "There appears to have been a custom in New Hampshire for a Governor to provide notice if he is to be absent or disabled for some significant period of time." Over the years, governors and senate presidents have worked out their own notification processes, and they vary widely. When Sen. Sylvia Larsen, a Concord Democrat, was Senate President between 2006 to 2010 then-Gov. John Lynch, a Democrat, didn’t tell her when he was leaving, she said. "In my four years (as Senate President) I don’t ever recall ever being notified," said Larsen, who did not seek reelection last year. "If I learned about it, it was just because we were friends." That wasn’t the case with Larsen’s successor, Peter Bragdon, a Milford Republican who was Senate President between 2010 and 2013, overlapping with both Lynch and Hassan’s terms. Lynch and Bragdon worked out an informal system, Bragdon said. Lynch’s chief of staff would notify Bragdon’s office when the governor would be out of state. It was the same when Hassan took over, he said. "It was pretty much a courtesy," said Bragdon, who is now executive director of Health Trust Inc., which was formerly part of the Local Government Center. Hassan’s office recently released documents showing that her chief of staff, Pam Walsh, emailed Morse’s chief of staff, Kristy Merill, on the morning of Thursday, Feb 19, 2015, to tell her Hassan would be out of state that evening through Monday. That was when Hassan went to Washington D.C. to attend the National Governors Association winter meeting. "She will be reachable by cell and email during the trip," Walsh wrote. Walsh again emailed on Feb. 27, to say Hassan would be out of the state until the morning of March 3 as she traveled to New York and Washington D.C. We’ll note that none of the governor’s powers were transferred to Morse during any of Hassan’s absences, according to the governor’s office. Our ruling New Hampshire Republican Party Chairwoman Jennifer Horn said Gov. Maggie Hassan "must inform the Senate president about his or her absence from the state." While according to the state Constitution the governor’s powers are passed onto the Senate president during certain gubernatorial absences, the Constitution does not specifically require notification. It has been a frequent practice for governors to notify the Senate president of their absence from the state (as Hassan has been doing by email) but this policy hasn’t been followed in every case.

pomt-09693	"I signed the largest single tax cut in the history of Florida, a $25 billion tax cut over five years, directed at property tax cuts."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/10/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-is-taking-credit-for-floridas-larges/	It's become part of Florida Gov. Charlie Crist's firewall when confronted with criticism that he isn't conservative enough. "I signed the largest single tax cut in the history of Florida, a $25 billion tax cut over five years, directed at property tax cuts," Crist said while speaking to a group of Michigan Republicans in September. "My state goes back to 1845; the largest tax cut since 1845 in the Sunshine State." Crist touts his tax-cutting record over and over, in news releases, political speeches and in the first radio ad for his U.S. Senate campaign. The line is good politics. But is it true? The property tax changes proposed by Crist and the Legislature in early 2007 were sold as the antidote to citizens' complaints that local government spending had spiraled out of control. Crist famously predicted taxes would "drop like a rock." On June 21, 2007, the governor signed House bills 1B and 5B — the two-pronged tax package. House Bill 1B required local governments to reduce their property tax rates to 2006 levels and mandated deeper cuts based on how much a local government collected in property tax dollars. The reported savings to taxpayers: $15.6 billion over five years. House Bill 5B, meanwhile, let voters consider further property tax changes. Also known as Amendment 1, the changes — which included an additional homestead benefit, limited property value increases for non-homesteaded property and created portability for Save Our Homes — were approved by voters in January 2008. The savings: $9.3 billion over five years. Combined, that's the $25 billion Crist is talking about. We have to address two questions to see if Crist's claim is right: Are the estimates correct? And do they constitute the largest state tax cut ever? Caution: The following information is considered highly wonky. Crist's tax math To estimate the financial impact of the 2007 and 2008 property tax changes, analysts at the governor's office first forecast a future as if the changes had not occurred. The process was relatively simple. Analysts estimated five years of statewide property tax collection information by multiplying a tax rate, which they did not change, by taxable property values, which they grew at 3 to 5 percent a year. The calculation, analysts said, attempted to replicate the billions of dollars in property taxes Floridians would pay each year if nothing else happened. With that baseline, analysts next built a world post-tax changes, multiplying an estimated new tax rate by the same property values. The difference between Year 1 of the first calculation and Year 1 of the second constitutes the governor's estimate of the savings to Florida taxpayers. They did the same math for years 2 through 5, and voila — $25 billion in savings. Simple? No, says David Gamage, an assistant professor at the University of California at Berkeley who specializes in taxation. The governor's estimates would be accurate only if property tax values increased as analysts predicted and local governments failed to reduce their tax rates, Gamage says. We will never know what governments would have done to their tax rates, but we do know about property tax values: They've gone down. Taxable property values dropped 15 percent in 2008, according to figures from county property appraisers. Property values are expected to drop again in 2009. "Even if this policy hadn't been enacted, the future would look different than today," Gamage said. It's the same reason that a recent Florida Association of Counties report concluded that of the $1.5 billion trimmed from property tax collections at the county level in the past three years, almost half is a result of falling property values, not the Crist-led changes. When questioned by PolitiFact, the governor's office admitted that its original savings estimates are now likely high and it has not rerun the analysis. What we do know is this: the Department of Revenue said that as a result of the legislative-mandated tax rate rollbacks, the state's property tax collections fell about $300 million ( page 9 ) from fiscal year 2007 to fiscal year 2008. And property tax collections in total fell an estimated $745 million ( page 163 ) from fiscal year 2008 to 2009, the first year the Amendment 1 changes took effect. That's a $1.05 billion reduction in property taxes. The governor's estimate predicted $6.1 billion in savings during that same period. If property values fail to increase, the gap will only widen since the changes are estimated to have a bigger impact in later years. Part of the difference in the numbers is that the governor's office counted future, theoretical increases in tax collections as part of its estimated "tax cut." And part of the difference is that falling property values wrecked the governor's projections. Is it the biggest? Despite inaccurate projections, the governor's office says the 2007 and 2008 tax cuts are still the state's largest. But what else competes? The governor's analysts point to the repeal of the intangibles tax. The intangibles tax — created during the Depression — was paid on investments, and at its peak, sat at 2 mills ($2 for every $1,000). The tax was cut under Gov. Lawton Chiles and repealed entirely in 2006 by Gov. Jeb Bush. At its height in 1999, it provided the state about $1.2 billion in revenue, according to the Department of Revenue. Adjusted for inflation, that translates to about $1.5 billion in 2007. That's a bigger tax break than what the Crist-led changes delivered in fiscal years 2007 and 2008, but not more than Crist's rosy projection. We wondered if anyone previously has claimed to be Florida's tax cut king. Bush did. In 1999, Bush and the Legislature passed what they called "the largest tax cut in state history." The $1.01 billion plan included further cuts to the intangibles tax, as well as the repeal of a per-drink tax on alcohol, a rollback in the school property tax rate and a reduction in unemployment taxes businesses pay, among other things. Kurt Wenner, director of Tax Research at Florida TaxWatch, suggested a third tax change that could be considered the state's largest: Save Our Homes. The amendment to the state Constitution proposed and approved by citizens in 1992 limited increases to the property value of homesteaded property in Florida. While there is debate about whether those savings were offset by people without homestead exemptions, the savings to homesteaded property owners is quantifiable. From 1996 to 2008, almost $1.9 trillion in property value went untaxed because of Save Our Homes. Using a conservative tax rate of 17 mills, that equates to $32 billion less in property taxes paid — or about $2.66 billion per year without adjusting for inflation. In 2007, the savings was about $7.27 billion and from 2004 to 2008 the estimated savings was more than $26 billion. Those numbers certainly are bigger than the Crist cuts so far, in reality and in projection. The governor's office said it did not consider Save Our Homes when it made the claim that the Crist tax changes constitute the state's largest. Officials then provided data that showed the saving in the first years of Save Our Homes was modest. But that's because the large savings came in later years as Save Our Homes protected against increases to properties' taxable value. Failing to consider Save Our Homes didn't sit well with Ken Wilkinson, the Lee County property appraiser who led the push for Save Our Homes — and supported the Crist-led changes. "I would say Save Our Homes is the largest tax cut in the history of Florida," Wilkinson said. "There is a savings, you can look it up, and it's real." Wilkinson and Wenner said you can't ignore Save Our Homes just because it was a citizen initiative. Moreover, the Crist-led changes built off Save Our Homes in two major ways — by making Save Our Homes portable and by creating a Save Our Homes style benefit for commercial and rental properties. If one's a tax cut, so is the other. Our ruling The Crist-led changes to Florida's property tax structure certainly required the lowering of tax rates and assessment values throughout Florida. But there are all kinds of holes in projecting the size and scope of the legislation's impact. The basis for the governor's estimate assumed a future that did not come to pass. Specifically, the governor's estimates relied on future property values continuing to increase and local governments failing to lower their property tax rate. We now know property values are decreasing. The governor's office admits its projections are now inaccurate because of declines in property values statewide. A state analysis concluded that the tax measures have failed to produce the savings estimated by the governor. Portability, for instance, was predicted to cut taxable property values by $11.5 billion in 2008. But it cut property values only $3.4 billion, the analysis showed. Here's the bottom line: While the tax structure changes passed by the Legislature, signed by Crist and approved by voters undoubtedly will result in less property taxes being paid by Florida residents, the specific financial impact of the initiatives remains quite unclear. Experts say projections can be misleading. But given the decline in home values, we know Crist will have difficulty reaching his claim of $25 billion over five years. In the absence of additional data, and with the knowledge that Save Our Homes has cut property tax bills for Florida residents $32 billion or more, we can't agree with Crist that the 2007 and 2008 changes constitute the largest tax cut in state history. We rule Crist's statement False.	None	Charlie Crist	None	None	None	2009-11-10T18:02:40	2009-09-25	['None']
pomt-00812	Georgia has one of the nation’s highest jet fuel taxes.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2015/mar/31/trebor-banstetter/delta-spokesman-mostly-correct-about-jet-fuel-taxe/	Time is running out for the 2015 General Assembly and for state lawmakers who had a lofty goal this session of raising at least $1 billion for transportation improvements. One of the backstories to the transportation bill (House Bill 170) has been: Will a fraction of the money -- about $23 million -- come from eliminating a controversial state jet fuel tax exemption? That tax break has benefitted hometown Delta Air lines for nearly a decade and was made permanent by that lawmakers and the governor in 2012. To some, eliminating the exemption seems reasonable. "The loophole is unnecessary since Delta is highly profitable and no longer at risk of bankruptcy, as they were a few years ago (when the exemption was first granted)," said Wesley Tharpe, analyst with the left-leaning Georgia Budget & Policy Institute. "Ending their special privileges at a time when we’re asking Georgians for more revenues makes sense." Delta executives don’t feel the same. They’ve called efforts to remove the exemption "one of the most business-unfriendly moves" by the General Assembly in recent years. Among Delta’s arguments is that the existing jet fuel taxes are already high enough and that a further increase could jeopardize Atlanta airport’s competitive status. "If approved, this measure would put Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport at an economic disadvantage by making aviation fuel taxes in Georgia some of the highest in the industry," Trebor Banstetter Delta spokesman told The Associated Press, referencing House Bill 175, a measure that initially would have eliminated the sales tax exemption just for Delta. Banstetter and other Delta officials have cited information from Airlines for America, the airline trade association, that they say backs ups their claim that Georgia already has one of the nation’s highest jet fuel tax rates. PolitiFact Georgia wondered: Could that be right? Buckle up, and let’s see where the facts take us. The right-leaning Tax Foundation ranked states for jet fuel taxes in June 2014 based on data from Airlines for America. The foundation found Georgia was 11th nationally at 15 cents, based on its combined effective jet fuel tax rate and fees per gallon. Illinois had the highest jet fuel taxes at 32.8 cents -- more than twice Georgia’s -- followed by California with 27 cents and Connecticut with 26.4 cents. Three states -- Texas, Ohio and Delaware -- had no jet fuel taxes. Of the 47 states that have some type of jet fuel tax or fee, Georgia is considered an outlier, said Victoria Day, spokeswoman for Airlines for America. "Most states do not apply a retail sales tax to jet fuel, which makes sense because taxing business inputs creates tax pyramiding," Day said. Georgia’s jet fuel sales tax would go from three percent to four percent, if the exemption is eliminated. To show how complicated the jet fuel tax computations are: 19 states don’t include any jet fuel in their sales tax base; 16 states tax private jet fuel purchases but exempt commercial airlines; and 15 states apply the sales tax to commercial jet fuel, although sometimes at a reduced rate. Finally, three states (New Jersey, New York, and Washington) only tax fuel estimated to be burned within their state borders, significantly reducing the burden of fuel taxes, the foundation’s report said. We found another report on jet fuel costs at 12 billion.org, a site run by Unite Here International Union, a group critical of tax exemptions benefitting the airlines. The report looked at costs at the major airports. It’s data was slightly older than the association’s. It showed fuel costs at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport as sixth highest at 15 cents a gallon and Chicago’s O'Hare International Airport as the highest at 32.75 cents per gallon, numbers identical to those reported by the airline trade association for 2014 for Georgia and Illinois, respectively. Commercial aviation supports more than 350,000 jobs and drives 45 billion in economic activity in Georgia, according to Airlines for America. How the tax break came to be Lawmakers first approved the jet fuel tax break for Delta in 2005, when the airline was headed into Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. They repeatedly extended the tax exemption even as the carrier’s finances improved and its stock soared, making it permanent for Delta and any airlines in 2012. State Rep. Earl Ehrhart, R-Powder Springs introduced House Bill 175 in January, saying it was time Delta "get off the taxpayer dime." He said the bill was retaliation against Delta officials for speaking out against a potential second airport in Paulding County or suggesting that lawmakers should not be "chicken" about raising taxes for transportation. Delta officials said Ehrhart’s bill, as originally drafted, was illegal because federal law requires jet fuel tax revenues be spent on airports or airport improvements, not go to the general fund, a statement PolitiFact Georgia ruled as True. Ehrhart vehemently denied the bill, which stalled in the House, was illegal, saying a three-year grace period from the feds would give the state a chance to reinstate the tax and spent the money as it wants, at least temporarily. Delta’s Banstetter said last week: "At this point, all we can say is that if the bill is passed it will be up to the FAA to decide whether the state is in compliance." In at least two other states -- North Carolina and Illinois -- legislators are considering proposals to remove tax breaks or close tax loopholes for airlines. Our conclusion: Delta officials are arguing against reinstating a 1-percent tax on jet fuel, which would generate about $23 million a year, mostly from Delta fuel purchases. Delta executives say that Georgia already has one of the nation’s highest jet fuel taxes and would have an even higher rate, if the exemption were eliminated. Georgia’s jet fuel tax is ranked 11th and is less than half of the tax in No. 1 rated Illinois. That bit of missing context takes this one down a notch on the Truth-O-Meter. We rate Banstetter’s statement Mostly True.	None	Trebor Banstetter	None	None	None	2015-03-31T00:00:00	2015-03-01	['None']
pomt-00462	Says Bill Nelson "doesn’t pay payroll taxes for his employees. He doesn’t even provide them with health benefits. It’s stealing money from Medicare and Social Security."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2018/aug/16/rick-scott/nelson-wasnt-paying-payroll-taxes-because-he-didnt/	A new attack ad portrays U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson as scamming his employees and the federal government by avoiding payroll taxes. The ad, released by Republican challenger Gov. Rick Scott, claims, "(Bill) Nelson doesn’t pay payroll taxes for his employees. He doesn’t even provide them with health benefits. It’s stealing money from Medicare and Social Security." Several PolitiFact readers emailed us (truthometer@politifact.com) to ask if the ad was accurate, so we decided to fact-check it. Back to the source The ad includes a headline that says, "Bill Nelson’s campaign avoiding taxes, health care costs on campaign staff." So we ruled out that Nelson’s official Senate staff were the employees the ad was talking about. The headline is from the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative news organization, which published an article July 13 stating that Nelson had not hired any full-time employees on his Senate campaign. Federal campaigns are required to disclose their spending information to the Federal Election Commission, which regulates campaign finances. When the story was published, the Nelson campaign had not disclosed any "disbursements" labeled as payroll. Likewise, there were no insurance payments for workers listed in FEC filings between January 2017 and June 2018. When we dug in deeper, we found that the Nelson campaign didn’t have any full-time staff to pay taxes on. In the first half of the year, the Nelson campaign was using paid consultants. "This isn’t unusual, as most political campaigns rely heavily on consultants, especially early on in the cycle," said Nelson spokeswoman Carlie Waibel. Employers do not need to pay the payroll tax on consultants. They also do not need to provide health benefits. Paul Herrnson, professor of political science at the University of Connecticut, said hiring consultants is relatively common, especially for incumbent politicians. Incumbents may work with consultants — often people and firms they’ve worked with on previous campaigns or during their time in office — to help raise money, conduct polls, and organize early campaign efforts. Staff for a campaign are hired to manage day-to-day activities and voter mobilization closer to the election. We checked the FEC filings to see if other campaigns relied heavily on consultants. We focused on nearly a dozen similar races— battleground states with an incumbent running for re-election. Based on the FEC filings for these campaigns, all 11 incumbents had hired staff (and paid payroll taxes) by June, when the last filing was due. Nelson’s tactics, while legal, do seem to be uncommon. (Some Democrats have criticized Nelson’s campaign as understaffed and overmatched.) The Nelson campaign hired some full-time employees in early July, according to Waibel, but these changes have not been reported to the FEC yet. The next filing is due on Aug. 16, and Nelson will have to begin paying payroll taxes on these new employees. As for health insurance, Waibel said, "Nelson for Senate staff are compensated to ensure they have access to health care. Health care costs are considered when establishing staffer's salaries." The ad is somewhat outdated, but it does align with the most recent data available online. "Stealing money from Medicare and Social Security" The ad also claims that Nelson is "stealing money from Medicare and Social Security" by not paying payroll taxes. The payroll tax is one of the major financiers for Medicare and Social Security. But a company that pays consultants is not "stealing" from Medicare or Social Security. Here’s how it works: When a company pays a full-time employee, they set aside 7.65 percent of the employee’s check to go toward Medicare and Social Security. The employer will match that, so effectively 15.3 percent of the employee’s salary is paid to Social Security and Medicare. For consultants, things get a little more complicated. Consultants, like other contract workers, generally have to pay the full 15.3 percent themselves to Medicare and Social Security. If the consultant employed his or her own full-time employees, the employees would pay half and their employer (the consultant) would pay half. The same amount of money will go to Medicare and Social Security, regardless of whether the Nelson campaign pays it or the consultants do. This may be a cost-cutting measure for the campaign, but it certainly isn’t "stealing," as the ad claims. Our ruling Scott released an ad which claimed, "Nelson doesn’t pay payroll taxes for his employees. He doesn’t even provide them with health benefits. It’s stealing money from Medicare and Social Security." Nelson relied on consultants for the early parts of his campaign. Because he did not have employees, he did not have to pay payroll taxes or provide health insurance. In July, Nelson hired employees, though they will not report that change to the FEC until mid-August. The campaign still does not provide healthcare to their employees but says that salaries are adjusted so staff will have access to care. Nelson does not have to pay payroll taxes on consultants. Instead, the consultants pay the payroll taxes. This is a common set-up for contract work. No money is being lost or stolen from the national funds. We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-13266	"We don't have any" chess grandmasters in the United States.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/14/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrongly-maligns-us-chess-prowess/	One of Donald Trump’s signature lines at rallies has been that the United States doesn’t win any more. "Folks, we don't win anymore, right?" he said in June in an event in the Woodlands, Texas. "We don't win anymore. We don't win! We don't win on anything." More recently, during an Oct. 10 rally in Ambridge, Pa., Trump offered a variation on that theme -- and the U.S. chess community wasn’t happy about his remarks. Trump was in the midst of criticizing international trade agreements, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership. He said he supports the idea of bilateral agreements, saying that such deals would make it possible for the United States to threaten to withdraw, then renegotiate on more favorable terms before the agreement expired. Trump went on to say that with multilateral pacts like the TPP, "you can't terminate -- there's too many people, you go crazy. It's like you have to be a grand chess master. And we don't have any of them." (You can see it here, around the 19:45 mark.) Trump’s statement sounded wrong to us. The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry, but as it turns out, it is wrong. In fact, the comment provoked anger and ridicule within the chess community, which knows that the United States is currently on a roll in international competition. Chess grandmasters It’s literally wrong that "we don’t have any" chess grandmasters. That’s the correct term, by the way, not "grand chess masters." Currently, the United States has 90 grandmasters, counting both men and women, which is enough to rank third-highest in the world. The title is awarded by FIDE, the international governing body of chess; it’s the highest rank conferred by the group, and it is given for life. Russia, a longtime chess powerhouse, ranks first with 234 grandmasters, while Germany ranks second with 91, just one more than the United States. Here’s a list of the top 30 nations in the FIDE rankings. Recent U.S. victories In the meantime, Trump chose a particularly inopportune moment for his comment. Most notable is the victory less than a month earlier by the U.S. men’s team at the 42nd Chess Olympiad in Baku, Azerbaijan -- which is considered the first time in nearly 80 years that the United States won the gold. To win in September, the United States bested such powerhouses as Russia, Ukraine, India and China. Chess may not be the most popular sport in the United States, but observers called the Olympic victory a watershed moment for U.S. chess. "The 2016 win in the Chess Olympiad is huge," said Olimpiu G. Urcan, a Singapore-based chess writer and historian. "The previous Olympiad was won by China, and Russia and Ukraine are extremely competitive. Having the United States finish first was a huge boost for chess in America and a moment of genuine pride. Many in the U.S. right now believe that the successes of 2016 could produce a rejuvenation of chess" similar to what happened with the international stardom of Bobby Fischer in the 1970s. Macauley Peterson, a Hamburg, Germany-based American who serves as content director for chess24, calls it "frankly discouraging" that the United States team "received so little media attention. The number of U.S. grandmasters is higher than ever, and winning the Olympiad was a historic achievement." Urcan was among the first to notice Trump’s quote and tweeted about it. That led to none other than Garry Kasparov -- probably the most famous living chess grandmaster -- to tweet his disbelief. Kasparov is Russian but is living in exile in New York City; he has been an outspoken critic of Russian leader Vladimir Putin. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Hikaru Nakamura, a U.S. Olympic team member and currently the world’s No. 7 ranked player, joined in: See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com In the meantime, the United States is home to 15-year-old grandmaster Jeffrey Xiong, who in August won the World Junior Chess Championship -- the first U.S. victory in the tournament in nearly two decades. And the United States is currently the only country to have three players in the world’s top 10 list -- Nakamura, Fabiano Caruana and Wesley So. A final note: There is a long history of foreign players flocking to affiliate with the U.S. team. The victorious Olympic team includes Fabiano Caruana, a dual American and Italian citizen who had previously played for Italy, and Wesley So, who was born in the Philippines. Our ruling Trump said, "We don't have any" chess grandmasters in the United States.

pomt-11016	Marijuana and THC "have caused emergency room visits to skyrocket."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2018/jul/06/patrick-kennedy/has-marijuana-caused-emergency-room-visits-skyrock/	Advocates against marijuana legalization frequently cite increased marijuana-related hospitalizations as proof the drug should not be sold commercially. But how much of a threat does cannabis actually present? Since retiring from Congress in 2010, Patrick J. Kennedy has been speaking out about his struggles with drug addiction and mental health. Kennedy is the co-founder of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, a non-profit dedicated to combating cannabis legalization. The group refers to marijuana as "the next ‘Big Tobacco’" and advocates for increased research into cannabis as a potential medicinal source, rather than a recreational drug. In Kennedy’s home state of Rhode Island, the push for recreational legalization continues. In February 2018, the Rhode Island General Assembly resolved to create a working committee to study the effects of legalization. In May, Sen. Joshua Miller introduced a bill to the House to legalize for all people 21 and over. The day after the bill was introduced, the Providence Journal published an editorial by Kennedy. In it, Kennedy draws connections between addiction and mental illness, and encourages readers to take control of their mental health through "healthy coping mechanisms and problem solving skills." Especially for children, he writes, turning to drugs as a way of handling stress is a dangerous road to follow. Good as that all sounds, one line in particular stood out to us: "These drugs (marijuana/THC), which masquerade as food, have caused emergency room visits to skyrocket," Kennedy wrote. Researchers are still working to determine the long-term health consequences of marijuana. Although each person reacts to THC differently, no deaths caused by marijuana alone have ever been recorded, according to a Drug Enforcement Administration fact sheet. Regardless of immediate health risks, though, marijuana can impair judgement, leading to more accidents, or cause anxiety and paranoia in some users, leading to panic attacks that may prompt hospital visits. We decided to look at the numbers and determine if marijuana really has caused emergency room visits to increase. Colorado case study When we contacted Kennedy about this claim, Kennedy’s spokeswoman directed us to two studies about marijuana usage in Colorado: one conducted by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, and another compiled by Smart Against Marijuana. Colorado was one of the first states to legalize marijuana for recreational use. Retail marijuana stores opened in early 2014, and medical marijuana had been legal since 2000. Colorado has also collected the most data on the consequences of marijuana legalization, serving as the template for other states considering the move. Hospitalization and emergency department visit rates related to marijuana are studied based on patient records. When a patient arrives at the emergency department, they are assigned "billing codes," which list their conditions. According to the American Health Information Management Association, the primary diagnoses should be listed first. The 2015 report from the Colorado Department of Public Health shows that hospitalizations with marijuana-related billing codes have climbed steadily over the years. In 2011, 1,313 per 100,000 hospitalizations had marijuana-related billing codes, a figure which had risen to 3,025 by 2015. However, hospitalizations and emergency department visits—the statistic that Kennedy claims to be citing—are slightly different. Emergency department visits refer to patients who come to the hospital and are treated without being admitted. According to Dr. Daniel Vigil, program manager of the Marijuana Health Monitoring and Research Program at the Colorado Department of Public Health, hospitalizations are more likely to include marijuana-related billing codes. "The limitation that a marijuana code might be present even when it isn't a causal factor in the visit may be more pronounced with hospitalizations, because there's more opportunity for gathering and documenting substance use information," Dr. Vigil told us in an email. "For this reason, I'm more likely to discuss the (emergency department) visit rates when asked about health impacts." So, although hospitalization rates are increasing in Colorado, emergency department rates are not. The emergency rate had increased from 2011 to 2014, peaking at 1,034 per 100,000 emergency visits, but then fell significantly in 2015 to only 754 per 100,000. In both this dataset and the data for hospitalizations, researchers counted any patient with a marijuana-related billing code, even if that code was unrelated to the injury being treated. So, if a patient were to come in with a cut on their hand, but also had smoked a few hours prior, they would receive a billing code and count as a "marijuana-related hospitalization." What’s it all mean? In Colorado, there has been a significant increase in patients being hospitalized with marijuana in their system. In the last decade, the hospitalization rate has more than doubled. However, it’s important to recognize that these numbers, while increasing, still make up a very small percentage of the total hospital visits. Three percent of hospitalizations in Colorado had a marijuana-related code in 2015, which could mean anything from "patient is currently high" to "patient smokes weed habitually." Only 0.6% of Colorado hospitalizations list marijuana in the top 3 billing codes. And again, none of that means that people are in the hospital because of marijuana. What About the Other States? There are currently few studies which examine marijuana-related hospitalizations within individual states, even in areas where recreational cannabis has been legalized. One nationwide study by Dr. He Zhu of Duke University Medical Center showed that across the United States, between 2004 and 2011, emergency department visits that involved the use of cannabis had increased from 51 to 73 per 100,000 patients between 2004 and 2011. Those that involved cannabis combined with other drugs had also increased from 63 to 100 per 100,000. So again, definitely a trend upwards, but marijuana-related cases still encompassed less than 0.01% of total hospitalizations. Similarly to the Colorado studies, the researchers relied on hospital records that could not identify cannabis as the cause of the visit, but rather just a contributing factor. Additionally, because the study only used data up until 2011, it could not accurately reflect the trends related to recreational sales. Is it causal? We cannot conclusively say that marijuana has caused an increase in visits to the emergency room. Rather, the data show that more people are arriving at the hospital having recently or habitually used cannabis, even if that is not their primary condition (or related at all to their primary condition). Through it seems plausible that impaired judgment or slowed reflexes may be a culprit, it is impossible to say how often that is true. Dr. Jerome Avorn, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, told us for a 2016 fact-check, "The main risk from marijuana is from the risky or stupid things people do after using it, such as driving, rather than from any toxic effects of the substance itself, which is remarkably safe." Our ruling Kennedy wrote that marijuana and THC, "have caused emergency room visits to skyrocket." It is true that hospitalizations have increased over the last decade by people using marijuana, both in states like Colorado that have legalized recreational cannabis and nationwide. However, due to the way hospitals keep patient records, it is impossible to say that marijuana is the cause of these visits. Rather, it is possible that the higher numbers of high patients are due simply to the fact that more people are using marijuana overall. To say that marijuana is causing emergency room visits to skyrocket is unfounded based on the limited data that has been collected. We rate this claim Half True. Correction: This article has been revised to better reflect uncertainty about the long-term medical effects of marijuana. It does not change the rating of the fact-check.

pomt-06494	When George W. Bush was governor of Texas, "the percentage uninsured went down." Under his successor, Rick Perry, "it's gone up."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/13/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-uninsured-increased-under-rick-pe/	During the Oct. 11, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Hanover, N.H., former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney sought to contrast health care in his state with that in rival Gov. Rick Perry's home state, Texas. "We (Massachusetts) have less than 1 percent of our kids that are uninsured," Romney told Perry. "You have a million kids uninsured in Texas. A million kids." Under the administration of George W. Bush, he continued, "the percentage uninsured went down. Under your leadership, it's gone up." We weren’t sure whether Romney meant the uninsurance rate for Texans of all ages, or specifically for children. Romney didn’t explicitly cite children in his comment, and when we contacted the campaign, they confirmed that he had meant uninsured Texans overall. However, the comment followed on the heels of discussion of uninsured children, so we think viewers would have reason to think Romney was talking about the uninsurance rate for kids only. As it turns out, which meaning is ascribed to Romney’s words pretty much determines whether Romney is right or wrong. To explain, we’ll turn to historical data compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau. First, let’s look at the uninsurance rate for the population as a whole. Under Bush, the percentage of Texans without health insurance declined from 24.5 percent in 1995 to 23.5 percent in 2001. Under Perry, the percentage without health insurance rose from 23.2 percent in 2001 to 26.1 percent in 2009, the most recent year available. (Eagle-eyed readers will notice that the rate for 2001 was slightly different for the two governors. This is because the Census Bureau changed its methodology in the interim.) So, based on the uninsurance rates for Texas’ population at large, Romney’s claim is justified. How about the rates for children? That’s a different story. Under Bush, the uninsurance rate for children fell from 22.4 percent in 1995 to 21.3 percent in 2001. Under Perry, the uninsurance rate for children didn’t rise -- it continued to fall, from 21.1 percent in 2001 to 16.5 percent in 2009. So looking at the children’s uninsurance rate, Romney’s comment is wrong. "The continued decline in the number of uninsured Texas children … is the silver lining to a very cloudy uninsured rate for Texas adults," said a report from the Center for Public Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank in Austin. The results for children’s uninsurance surprised us. Even as uninsurance rates for the Texas population as a whole were rising, the rates for children were falling -- and falling faster than the overall rates rose. In addition, the rate of children without insurance in Texas fell faster than the national rate, which declined from 11.3 percent in 2001 to 10 percent in 2009. And this all came as Texas’ population was increasing by about 20 percent, meaning that huge numbers of kids had to be added to the insurance rolls just to keep pace with population growth. One explanation we looked at is the margin of error for the Census Bureau studies. Using the sampling error values included in the tables, we found that the declines for both all Texans and children during the Bush years was within the margin of error. That means that the decreases we saw might actually have been an increase -- the measurements weren’t precise enough to know for sure. However, the changes under Perry were all outside the margin of error. So sampling error didn’t cause an anomaly with Perry’s statistics. As it turns out, the biggest increase in childrens’ coverage under Perry came from government programs, mostly Medicaid, which is a joint federal-state program. In 2001, 22.5 percent of children received their health care from Medicaid; by 2009, that rose to 37.4 percent. During that same period, the percentage covered by private health insurance fell from 59 percent to 48.5 percent. Both Bush and Perry acted to increase coverage of Texas children by Medicaid and other government programs, though both of them also took actions that worked against or delayed increasing coverage. In 1997, when Bush was governor, the Texas Legislature established the Texas Healthy Kids Corp., a public-private partnership that subsidized coverage for children in families with incomes up to 185 percent of the federal poverty line. That same year, Congress passed the State Children’s Health Insurance Program, which gives federal matching funds for states to help low-income children get health coverage. By 1999, after initially being criticized for slow adoption of SCHIP, Bush and the Legislature sped up Texas’ utilization of the program. "Texas was slow in enacting and implementing SCHIP expansions, in part because the Legislature meets only every other year, and the federal authorizing statute was enacted after adjournment in 1997," wrote Joshua M. Wiener and Niall Brennan in a 2002 paper for the Urban Institute, an independent Washington think tank. "After implementation, however, enrollment in the Texas SCHIP program increased quickly. In June 2000, enrollment was only 39,859 beneficiaries, but by September 2001, it had reached 439,222 children." Bush also signed Medicaid eligibility simplification provisions for children, which helped increase coverage rates. Perry, for his part, first tried to privatize many of the administrative functions of his health and human services department, a decision that led to backlogs and hampered signups for Medicaid, said Anne Dunkelberg, associate director of the Center for Public Policy Priorities. Later, Perry pulled back and instead appointed Tom Suehs to head the department. Under Suehs, Dunkelberg said, the department has "really turned things around," possibly explaining the past few years of insurance coverage gains among children, she said. So both governors did some things that boosted coverage (and some things that didn’t) but their powers were hardly dictatorial. To the extent that Texas has seen gains in coverage among children, significant credit goes to the federally supported programs of Medicaid and SCHIP. And numerous other factors, including the general state of the economy, have an impact on insurance coverage rates. Our ruling Romney’s camp said he meant to refer to the uninsured population as a whole, and using those statistics, he’s right that uninsurance rates declined under Bush (though within the statistics’ margin of error) and rose under Perry. But we think many viewers, seeing the comment in context, might have assumed that Romney was referring to uninsurance among children. And for children, uninsurance has actually declined steeply under Perry. Meanwhile, the policies pursued by both Bush and Perry had an influence on their respective trendlines, but their records in this regard were somewhat mixed and other factors also contributed. On balance, we rate the statement Half True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2011-10-13T18:55:37	2011-10-11	['Rick_Perry', 'Texas', 'George_W._Bush']
pomt-00924	Says he "often" appeared on The O’Reilly Factor and "often was praised" by Bill O'Reilly.	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2015/feb/26/david-corn/mother-jones-reporter-oreilly-often-praised-wor/	Mother Jones writer David Corn finds himself in the crosshairs of Bill O’Reilly after Corn and Daniel Schulman wrote that O’Reilly embellished his personal experiences covering the Falklands War in Argentina. Corn's initial story said O'Reilly claimed he reported in a "war zone" when he was not. O'Reilly disputed the story and called Corn "an irresponsible guttersnipe." We’ll leave it to you to decide who to believe in that he-said, he-said. But we were struck by something Corn said during an appearance on the Feb. 25, 2015, Rachel Maddow Show. Apparently, Corn once worked for Fox News, and he and O’Reilly were something of pals. Here’s how Corn put it: "I’ve watched Bill O’Reilly over the years. In fact I used to work there from 2001 to 2008, and was often on Bill’s show and often was praised by Bill, not as a liar but as a good reporter. But that was then. This is now." Corn said. That’s an interesting little nugget in this media story that we thought was worth verifying. As it turns out, when Corn was the Washington editor of The Nation, a long standing left-of-center publication, he had a contract with Fox News and played the role of arch liberal against the network’s roster of conservative voices. We went to the Nexis transcript database to see how many times Corn appeared and what O’Reilly said about him. Corn appeared on Fox News at least 60 times. Six of those appearances came on O’Reilly’s The O’Reilly Factor (May 3, 2002; Nov. 18, 2002; Jan. 15, 2003; March 4, 2003; April 7, 2003; and April 20, 2007). Six appearances over five years is hardly often, but what did O’Reilly have to say about Corn? We found one occasion when O’Reilly explicitly praised Corn’s reporting. In November 2002, a few months before the Iraq War, Corn wrote that a small socialist group called the Worker’s World Party had played a key role in organizing a large anti-war demonstration. O’Reilly clearly valued journalism that revealed a tie between the protest march and a group that O’Reilly called "hardcore commies." "All right, Mr. Corn, good reporting," O’Reilly said. "Nobody else reported that. And we appreciate it." That was as effusive as O’Reilly ever got with Corn. The two men always sparred aggressively, transcripts show. A couple of weeks before the start of the Iraq War, Corn argued that the evidence was thin that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and that the United States was ill prepared for the aftermath of an invasion. O’Reilly said an invasion was worth the risk, but at the end, appreciated Corn for his feistiness. "Mr. Corn, we appreciate your point of view. Thanks for coming in, and standing up," he said. After the war began, Corn appeared again to challenge O’Reilly’s belief that papers like the New York Times slanted their headlines to make the fight look tougher for American forces than it actually was. As the segment clock ran down, O’Reilly threw it back to Corn. "David, because we like you as a guest, give you the last word. You've got 15 seconds. Go," O’Reilly said. On one occasion O’Reilly called Corn "a left-wing, liberal, pinko communist," a remark that Corn took in good humor. Once, O’Reilly accused Corn of intellectual dishonesty. O’Reilly also described Corn and journalist Robert Scheer in 2006 as "bomb throwers" and "very far-left individuals." We spoke to the Mother Jones public affairs director, shared the results of our Nexis search and asked if there were any other details we should know. We did not hear back and will post an update if we do. Our ruling Corn said that before this current brouhaha with O’Reilly, he appeared often on O’Reilly’s show and was often praised by the Fox News host. Corn’s use of the word "often" wouldn’t pass the eye test of most fact-checkers. While Corn was a guest on Fox News programs many times, he had just six appearances with O’Reilly between 2001 and 2008, transcripts show. And as for praise, O’Reilly explicitly did so once. A few other times O’Reilly expressed his satisfaction with Corn as a spokesman for a liberal perspective. But he also described him as bomb thrower and very far-left individual. Corn’s statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context. We rate the claim Half True.	None	David Corn	None	None	None	2015-02-26T17:45:25	2015-02-25	['None']
pomt-06594	Says Rick Perry wrote a letter "supporting Hillarycare."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2011/sep/24/ron-paul/ron-paul-says-rick-perry-wrote-letter-supporting-h/	Standing next to the other Texan seeking the Republican presidential nomination, U.S. Rep. Ron Paul of Lake Jackson suggested during a Sept. 7, 2011, debate that Gov. Rick Perry had flip-flopped on health care. "You know, the governor of Texas criticized the governor of Massachusetts for Romneycare, but he wrote a really fancy letter supporting Hillarycare," Paul said, referring to two well-known health care overhaul plans that were debated about a dozen years apart. "Romneycare" is a term that critics use to refer to a 2006 Massachusetts health care law signed by then-Gov. Mitt Romney, who is also currently seeking the Republican presidential nomination. Many Republicans have criticized the law as a government intrusion into the health care system, including through its mandate that residents obtain health coverage. As PolitiFact has noted in previous fact-checks, the Massachusetts law is similar to the act that President Barack Obama signed into law in 2010. For this article, we’re reviewing only whether Perry wrote in support of what critics call "Hillarycare." We’re not judging that label. Days after entering office in January 1993, President Bill Clinton created a task force to write health care overhaul legislation to bring costs under control and extend coverage to the nation’s uninsured. He selected his wife, Hillary, to lead it. In September 1993, President Clinton outlined his plan in a speech to Congress, and two months later, legislation was formally introduced by Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine. According to a 1994 analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation, Clinton’s proposal for universal coverage built on an employer-based health insurance system, requiring individuals to have coverage and employers to provide coverage for their workers and contribute to their premiums. The plan also would have created "health-purchasing alliances" in which private insurers and providers would compete for business from people and businesses. A September 1993 New York Times news article reported that Americans "would be guaranteed a generous basic package of coverage, negotiated separately in each state by alliances of consumers with insurance companies and medical groups." During the Sept. 7 debate, Perry did not dispute that he had written a letter to the first lady in 1993 when he was the Texas agriculture commissioner. "We were hoping that she would be able to come up with something that would not leave (out) the agriculture men and women — because I was the agriculture commissioner at that particular point in time," Perry said. "We had no idea it was going to be the monstrosity that's known as Hillarycare." Perry’s letter — dated April 6, 1993, and posted online Aug. 30, 2011, by the conservative website Daily Caller — was sent on Texas Department of Agriculture stationery. It opens with Perry saying that he thinks Clinton's "efforts in trying to reform the nation's health care system are most commendable." He continues: "I would like to request that the task force give particular consideration to the needs of the nation's farmers, ranchers, agriculture workers, and other members of rural communities. Rural populations have a high proportion of uninsured people, rising health care costs, and often experience lack of services." Perry then details some of the health care delivery problems in rural areas of Texas, including hospital closures and shortages of providers "within a safe driving distance." The letter continues: "I have made economic development for rural Texans a high priority in my Administration. Leadership, education, infrastructure systems, and health care facilities can do much towards aiding a rural community to prosper." In closing, the letter revisits its opening, stating that Perry thinks Clinton's efforts are "worthy" and asking that she "remember this constituency as the task force progresses." The letter was last brandished against Perry in 2005 when U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison was considering challenging him in the 2006 Republican gubernatorial primary. In a March 2005 news article, though, the Houston Chronicle described Perry’s letter as falling "far short of actually being an endorsement" of the Clinton health care plan. However, the story said, the letter was penned at a time when some commentators were already describing Clinton's idea for a "government-sponsored HMOs and health care cooperatives as 'socialism.' " The Chronicle article quotes Perry's 2006 campaign manager, Luis Saenz, as saying that when the letter was written, "I don't know that anybody knew what the final efforts were going to be." In an Aug. 30, 2011, radio interview with Sean Hannity, who also has a Fox News Channel program, Perry said he wrote the letter because he didn't want the Clinton administration "to overlook a very important constituency." Perry said he had no idea that the "end product" would be "this monstrosity of a bill." Fair enough? Not so fast, said Gary Howard, a spokesman for the Paul campaign, who told us in an email that key aspects of the Clinton health care plan were already known before Perry signed the letter to the first lady. He pointed to a news article published in the Los Angeles Times the day before the date of Perry's letter. The April 5, 1993, article says that although many key details of the reform plan remained unsettled, "the broad outlines" were emerging. The story included specifics, including that the plan would likely create new "government-certified regional health insurance purchasing cooperatives" and impose a requirement that employers provide insurance to their workers. We checked to see what Austin American-Statesman readers were learning about the work of the health care task force around the same time. In the second half of March and first week of April 1993, the newspaper published at least 10 news and opinion articles related to the task force or its work, including reports on possible reform ideas and reactions to them. On April 3, 1993, the Statesman published a Los Angeles Times story on its front page noting that the Clinton plan was expected to lead to universal health coverage and a guaranteed set of health benefits for all Americans. The article quoted Ira Magaziner, a leader of the Clinton task force, as saying that care would be delivered under a "managed competition system," with residents of a geographic area choosing among several health plans that meet government standards. The story also says the Clinton proposal would require businesses to provide health coverage for their employees. Workers could either choose their company's plan or select one offered by "local buying organizations," which the employer would pay for, according to the article. The next day, the Statesman published another Times article; it details three mechanisms that the task force was reportedly considering to impose price controls on health care services. Our ruling It's correct that Perry sent a letter to Hillary Clinton commending her efforts as the head of the president’s health care task force at a time when the president’s general goals and some possible specifics of the plan had been reported. Yet Perry's letter, dispatched more than five months before the plan was finalized, is clearly a request that the task force consider the interests of rural Americans. We rate the statement as Mostly False.	None	Ron Paul	None	None	None	2011-09-24T14:05:48	2011-09-07	['Rick_Perry']
pomt-03817	"Under Gov. Kasich, Ohio wages have increased by $10.3 billion."	true	/ohio/statements/2013/mar/21/john-kasich/gov-john-kasich-says-ohio-wages-are-more-10-billio/	With budget battles looming for Gov. John Kasich's plans on taxing and spending, Ohio's improving economy remains a bright spot for him. Kasich promised during the 2010 gubernatorial race that his pro-business agenda would bring jobs to Ohio, and he has touted his record on job creation since his first year in office. On March 15, he tweeted about it with another angle: "The most recent data shows OH wages have jumped by $10.3 billion. Ohioans are creating jobs and driving our comeback." It linked to a picture with the overlay "Under Gov. Kasich, Ohio wages have increased by $10.3 billion." PolitiFact Ohio wanted more detail and wondered about the source of the wage figure. Kasich's office pointed to data assembled by the Bureau of Labor Market Information of the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services. Specifically citing the figures for total wages of workers employed in Ohio, they compared the combined wages for the third and fourth quarters of 2010 and the first and second quarters of 2011 against the period starting six months after Kasich took office -- the third and fourth quarters of 2011 and the first and second quarters of 2012. The first four quarters total $204.2 billion (averaging $51 billion per quarter). The second four quarters total $214.5 billion (averaging $53.6 billion). The difference: $10.3 billion. We looked further, hoping to make the numbers more meaningful to individuals, and found that per capita income in Ohio increased 4.5 percent in 2011, the most recent figures available, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. PolitiFact has always stipulated that the ability of an individual governor -- or president or any other elected official -- to influence the economy is limited. Determining how credit or blame should be apportioned is seldom clear. Kasich took office at a time when Ohio's employment picture already had begun to improve. The wage growth for the time period under the Republican governor could as easily be classified as having happened under President Barack Obama, a Democrat (as Mitt Romney found last fall). In his tweet, Kasich did not try to apportion responsibility or take personal credit for wage growth in Ohio. In fact, he credited Ohioans with "creating jobs and driving our comeback." The link to the photo with the words "Under Gov. Kasich. . .," however, seemed clearly designed to attribute the wage growth to Kasich. Still, we have previously found that Kasich can certainly lay claim to having kept some jobs here and attracted new ones. The numbers back up his statement. We rate it as True.

pomt-10743	"Our tax code is so complicated it extracts $140 billion in extra tax preparation costs every year - one thousand dollars for every American family."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/05/john-mccain/the-high-cost-of-paying-taxes/	Sen. John McCain wants to overhaul our complex tax code and turn it into something simpler. In making the case against current tax laws, he pulled together an array of statistics. In a speech in September 2007, McCain got specific: "Our tax code is so complicated it extracts $140 billion in extra tax preparation costs every year - one thousand dollars for every American family. It's offensive that six out of every ten taxpayers have to pay someone else just to figure out how to pay the government." According to McCain's campaign, the senator got his stats from a 2005 report from the President's Advisory Panel on Tax Reform. Some of the numbers are right. It's true that six out of 10 individual tax filers pay someone to prepare their returns, according to the IRS. But when McCain says the total cost of tax preparation is $140 billion, he's got nothing to back him up. The Advisory Panel on Tax Reform that he cites has no background citations and the only place we can find that $140 billion figure is a Tax Foundation study from 2001 that referred the cost of tax preparation for individuals and businesses. A 2005 study by the Tax Foundation puts the value at closer to $111-billion. That would put the per-family cost at about $822. But this is worth noting: The dollar figure for spending on tax preparation is a calculation of the value of the time people spend working on their taxes, which the Tax Foundation put at about $39 an hour, not how much they pay to tax pros. That's not clear in McCain's statement. McCain has suggested fixing the tax code by getting a task force headed by former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan to come up with a plan for simplifying the code and putting it to Congress for an up or down vote. McCain's point is on target; tax preparation is costly because the tax code is so complicated. But McCain is off by a good bit on the figure he uses and he's not being clear that the cost he's talking about isn't an expense of dollars but of time. That leads us to a Half True.

The claim appears under the heading "Bending the Rules." Curiosity steered us to take a closer look. A word: It’s legal for state legislators to lease vehicles with campaign funds so long as the vehicles are not for personal benefit. Put another way, Texas law permits campaign contributions to be used to pay expenses incurred while holding an elected office as well as those incurred while campaigning. Conversely, state law bars candidates or officeholders from converting campaign funds to "personal use," which the law defines as a "use that primarily furthers individual or family purposes not connected with the performance of duties or activities as a candidate." Austin lawyer Fred Lewis, who wrote a 2004 report detailing expenditures by Texas lawmakers on vehicles and other expenses, told us by phone that the leasing of cars is a "very common practice. There is nothing unusual about it in the least." And the fact that Wentworth leases cars qualifies as old news. According to a July 30, 2007, Houston Chronicle news article, Wentworth spent $20,308 from January through June 2007 to lease a Lexus. The newspaper quoted Wentworth as saying the campaign Lexus is in keeping with the kind of cars he drives in his personal life. He said it is necessary for driving the dangerous stretch of Interstate 35 between San Antonio and Austin. "It's a matter of safety," Wentworth told the newspaper. Three years earlier, Chronicle columnist Rick Casey noted that Houston Democratic Sen. Rodney Ellis was paying $630 a month to lease a campaign vehicle and Sen. John Whitmire, D-Houston, had plunked down $29,211 in campaign contributions for a "campaign vehicle." Casey said Wentworth and then-Sen. Kip Averitt, R-Waco, had leased top-of-the-line Infiniti sedans. We asked the PAC for the basis of its claim, especially the part about bending the rules. Spokesman Allen Blakemore emailed us a spreadsheet listing car lease expenditures from 2000 to 2012 that he told us by phone were drawn from Wentworth’s campaign finance reports. We compared the research to Wentworth’s campaign finance filings, finding minor discrepancies with the research while otherwise confirming the PAC’s proclaimed cost of the leases, $212,446.20, over the dozen years. We asked to interview Wentworth and heard from his campaign consultant, Bryan Eppstein, who declined to address the specific claim. Broadly, Eppstein said, Wentworth’s auto expenses are not unusual for a legislator whose district runs from part of Bexar County through four counties into a chunk of Travis County. Wentworth "travels across his district every day," and during this campaign he’s driven to 40 debates in six counties, Eppstein said. In a follow-up interview, Blakemore asserted that Wentworth drives no other vehicles, so he must have used leased cars for personal purposes. Also, Blakemore said, Wentworth’s reported campaign contributions and expenditures fail to show the senator regularly reimbursing his campaign for times he used the leased vehicles for personal purposes. Eppstein later said that Wentworth has three personal cars, also saying by phone that Wentworth has driven leased vehicles only for campaign or officeholder purposes. Earlier, Eppstein provided a confidential June 9, 2009, order from the Texas Ethics Commission dismissing a complaint referring in part to Wentworth spending $54,740 in campaign funds on auto leases. The order quotes Wentworth swearing that he used those vehicles for office-related purposes. "I have other vehicles for personal use, and personally pay the cost of operating the leased vehicles when they are used for personal purposes." Eppstein told us Wentworth’s statement that he paid for personal uses of leased vehicles was hypothetical. The commission’s order notes that Wentworth swore that he used the leased vehicles only for official duties and used personal vehicles for personal purposes. "There is no evidence to contradict" those sworn statements, the order says, thus insufficient evidence that Wentworth violated the law. Our ruling Wentworth spent some $212,000 in campaign funds leasing vehicles, as the PAC says. Then again, such leases are allowed if the vehicles are used for officeholder or campaign purposes, which is how Wentworth's camp says he uses the leased vehicles. All told, this claim portrays spending on a permitted activity as "bending the rules" without evidence of wrongdoing. We rate the statement as Mostly False.

pomt-05016	"If you make more than $250,000 a year … you only really take home about $125,000."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/16/steve-doocy/steve-doocy-says-someone-earning-250000-pays-half-/	Steve Doocy, one of the co-hosts of Fox & Friends, last week took aim at President Barack Obama’s longstanding proposal to let the George W. Bush-era tax cuts expire for taxpayers making $250,000 and up. "If you make more than $250,000 a year, (President Obama wants to) jack up your taxes about 5 percent," Doocy said on the July 11 edition of the show. "But when you think about it, at $250,000 you only really take home about $125,000, which in some parts of the country, if you've got a couple of kids in college, is not much money." A reader asked us to check whether Doocy was right that a typical taxpayer earning $250,000 a year would be left with only $125,000 in take-home pay. (Fox’s media office did not return an inquiry for this story.) The main taxes we’ll consider here are federal income taxes, federal payroll taxes and state income taxes. • Federal income taxes: A table produced by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center offers data on the "effective tax rate" -- that is, how much a filer paid in income tax divided by their income -- for various income ranges. More than a third of those earning $200,000 and up had an effective tax rate between 15 percent and 20 percent. Just under one-third had an effective rate between 20 and 25 percent. So, if you’re earning $250,000, this means you’re pretty typical if you’re paying between $37,500 and $62,500 in federal income taxes. • Federal payroll taxes: An employee will pay Social Security taxes (6.2 percent on the first $110,100 of salary) and Medicare taxes (1.45 percent of all of their salary). Someone who’s self employed will pay twice that, to cover the employer’s share. So the payroll tax can add an additional $8,000 to $17,000 to the tax bill. • State income taxes: State income taxes vary widely; in fact, some states have no income tax at all. A 5 percent state income tax, which is somewhere in the middle of the pack, could add an additional $10,000 to $12,500, or perhaps less, depending on how many deductions are being taken. Adding these three tax categories together and subtracting them from $250,000 gives us a range of take-home pay from $158,000 to $194,500. Either figure is well above the $125,000 in take-home pay that Doocy claims. Is it possible to get the taxes so high they can cut take home pay for $250,000 to just half? Let’s construct an extreme example to see if it gets us there. Using the IRS’ tax calculator, we plugged in information for an individual who earned a $250,000 salary, without any other non-salary income such as capital gains. Although this would shock our hypothetical taxpayer’s hypothetical CPA, we assumed the taxpayer refused to use even the most basic deductions beyond the standard deduction. No home-mortgage deduction, charitable donations, child credit or IRAs. And no offshore tax shelters. According to the IRS calculator, this unlucky taxpayer would owe the IRS $63,811 in federal income taxes. Add in payroll taxes ($8,817 to $17,634) and income taxes for the state with the highest rate, Hawaii (roughly $25,000) and it brings you to, at worst, take-home pay of $143,555. So, even in this extreme and highly improbable example, the taxpayer takes home more money than the $125,000 Doocy claimed. We checked our math with Steve Street, an accountant with the firm Ross & Moncure in Alexandria, Va. He ran a hypothetical tax return for a single New Yorker earning $250,000, first as an employee and then as a self-employed businessperson, with no deductions beyond the standard deduction. The employee takes home $153,629, while the self-employed businessperson takes home $148,408. One might be tempted to throw other taxes into the equation. However, tax experts do not typically include property taxes or sales taxes in such comparisons because they are so variable and require too many assumptions about behavior, said William McBride of the Tax Foundation. Assuming that someone has a house or property with a large tax bill is "not a normal assumption to make," McBride said. "You could also get there with sales taxes, but again you’d have to make some very particular assumptions about consumption which are not very representative." Even if you take this inadvisable course of adding in property taxes, it’s highly unlikely that they could provide the additional $20,000 in taxation needed to hit Doocy’s benchmark even in this extreme case. For instance, to return to our Hawaii example, the state’s highest median property tax payment for any county is $1,463, in Honolulu County. So to make it to Doocy’s $125,000 level you’d need to be stuck with a property tax bill almost 14 times the county’s median. Bottom line? "Doocy is stretching it," McBride said. Our ruling Doocy said someone who earns $250,000 a year ends up with take-home pay of just $125,000. But typical taxpayers end up with comfortably more than that. We found someone with that salary would take home $158,000 to $194,500 -- and even more if they lived in a state without income tax. Even our most extreme example produced quite a bit more take-home pay than he suggested. We rate Doocy’s statement False.	None	Steve Doocy	None	None	None	2012-07-16T14:41:10	2012-07-11	['None']
pomt-06693	Say Ohio Reps. Marcia Fudge, Marcy Kaptur and Dennis Kucinich are "socialists who are openly serving in the U.S. Congress."	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2011/sep/06/blog-posting/bloggers-claim-reps-marcia-fudge-marcy-kaptur-and-/	Politicians need thick skin. Name calling has a long, if not honorable, history in public life, and opinions are protected speech under the Constitution. But all names are not equal -- nor are they even matters of opinion. A number of websites and blogs recently have been busy claiming there are 70 card-carrying Socialists in the U.S. House of Representatives, including three Democrats from Ohio: Reps. Marcia Fudge, Marcy Kaptur and Dennis Kucinich. (The number actually varies. Some posts say 70, others insist it’s either 73 or 76 and some go as high as 83. One post used both 76 and 75 in the same entry.) While most of the names politicians are called are opinions, calling a congressman a Socialist sounds both emphatic and exact, which always gets our attention at PolitiFact Ohio. Another thing that gets our attention is when a claim gets spread far and wide. This one meets that test, too. Our colleagues at PolitiFact Oregon scrutinized the claim because it also named two members of that state's congressional delegation. We're following their work here. An Aug. 12 post on the website for a group called Sovereign Citizens United mentions Fudge, Kaptur and Kucinich by name. It also says this: "I’m sure if you asked random people on the street if we had open socialists in the U.S. Congress, they would say – well only Bernie Sanders (Senate). But the right answer is much, much worse." "This should come as a surprise to absolutely no one," says an Aug. 16 post on ConservativeByte.com. "The radical Marxist-progressives (communists) took control of the Democrat party some time ago. They’ve only become more emboldened with the election of Barack Obama, who was raised as a communist from birth." In case you miss the point, the post comes equipped with a large and very bright hammer and sickle emblem. Here’s a blog post on Aug. 17 by Texas radio host Dan Cofall, whose show airs out of Fort Worth: "The magic number ‘70’ is the number of members of the 111th Congress who are members of the Democratic Socialists of America. These are not just politicians who vote left of center; these are card-carrying members of ‘the Democratic Socialists of America’." Cofall did not respond to an email asking for comment. And PolitiFact couldn’t reach anyone from ConservativeByte. Before our ruling, let’s begin with some basics. Congress resets itself every two years, which means the current edition is the 112th Congress, not the 111th. Why does that matter? Because the new Congress that begins in January every two years always follows an election and some of the people on the list are no longer in office. Cofall acknowledges this but then continues to list names from the 111th Congress anyway. Those listed as "card carrying" socialists who are no longer serving include Robert Wexler (Florida), Phil Hare (Illinois), John Hall (New York), Alan Grayson (Florida), and Neil Abercrombie (Hawaii). Then there’s this: Real card-carrying Socialists say those members are not Socialists. The list that Cofall and dozens more rely upon "is completely fraudulent," said Frank Llewellyn, who served as national director of the Democratic Socialists of America for 10 years until stepping down July 5. There is not one member of Congress who is a formal member of the DSA, Llewellyn said. In order to join, a person must fill out a form and pay dues. Even Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, is not a formal member of the DSA, Llewellyn said. The last member of Congress who was an actual card-carrying member, he said, was California Democratic Rep. Ron Dellums, who served 28 years in the House until leaving in 1998. Llewellyn and DSA’s new national director, Maria Svart are chagrined for two reasons. First, they have to spend time knocking down reports that never seem to go away. Second, Llewellyn said, "if we had formal political relationships with 70-odd members, we would be making a lot more money’’ from dues. For the record, Fudge, Kaptur and Kucinich say they’ve never been associated with the Democratic Socialists of America. Fudge's spokeswoman, Belinda Prinz, said the same claim came up last year, when the congresswoman's office contacted one website and asked that her name be removed from its list. "We're sorry to see this erroneous information get repeated," Prinz said. "She has never been a member of the Democratic Socialists of America and never endorsed their activities or policies." Kaptur denied the accusation and said, "As a Polish-American, I know very well the difference between totalitarian communism and fascism on the one hand and social-democratic governments in Europe that include our NATO allies." Her spokesman, Steve Fought, said the claim "is part of this unfortunate trend in our country where if you don't agree with someone politically, you vilify and villainize them. "A lot of people who throw the word socialism around don't even know what it is and couldn't distinguish the different varieties," he said. "It's a facile way for people who don't understand shades of gray to talk about political movements." Kucinich said: "I'm a Democrat." Bad information gets spread all the time. But where did the number, or numbers, come from? The list purported to have originated with the DSA says this on page two: Q: How many members of the U.S. Congress are also members of the DSA? A: Seventy It then lists them by name. What it does not say is that the names are simply lifted en masse from the membership of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, a collection of liberal-leaning lawmakers that includes not a single socialist. According to its website, the Progressive Caucus is one of the largest in Congress and works for such causes as economic justice, civil rights and civil liberties as well as global peace and security. Llewellyn said that DSA supports some of the policy positions of the caucus. Voicing support for positions embraced by a group of lawmakers is a routine part of business on Capitol Hill and is employed by organizations as disparate as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Rifle Association and NORML, a group devoted to legalizing the use of marijuana. But agreeing with some positions doesn’t make a member of Congress a card-carrying Socialist. Llewellyn says similar accusations of Socialism (with a capital S) have surfaced every election year since 1991 when the Progressive Caucus was created. "There’s nothing we can do to stop it, Llewellyn said. "I can’t tell you the number of times we’ve tried to stop it." Misinformation and smear campaigns also are part of political life. But these persistent claims about socialists are riddled with errors and outright lies. Any one of the problems would be sufficient to discredit the report, but taken together, the effort is flagrantly false. For that reason, we rate this claim: Pants on Fire.

pomt-06949	Says a new report proves the stimulus supported by N.J. Democrats cost $278,000 per job.	false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jul/19/national-republican-congressional-committee/NRCC-stimulus-278k-per-job/	Republicans in Congress were not functioning independently of one another on their first workday after the Independence Day holiday. Shortly after noon on July 5, House Speaker John Boehner "tweeted" a July 3 blog posting from the conservative Weekly Standard’s website, labeling it "POTUS’ economists: ‘Stimulus’ Has Cost $278,000 per job." Around 4 p.m., the National Republican Congressional Committee followed suit with multiple press releases that used the same Weekly Standard blog item to target dozens of Democrats in Congress, including New Jersey’s Rush Holt and Frank Pallone. Its headline: "New Report Shows Dems’ Failed Stimulus Cost $278,000 Per Job As Economy Got Worse." It went on to claim that Holt’s and Pallone's "government spending spree" "delivered little except skyrocketing debt owed to foreign countries like China." By 4:55 p.m., the National Republican Senatorial Committee had recycled the Weekly Standard blog posting to attack Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown. This time the claim was: "President Obama’s own top economists estimate that the Obama-Brown stimulus debacle cost taxpayers an average $278,000 per job." Our sister website, PolitiFact Ohio, thought the concerted GOP effort made it worthy of a look. Since Boehner kicked it off on Twitter, they used his tweet. The Weekly Standard blog item that spawned the statistic cites a July 1 report by the White House Council of Economic Advisers, which states the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act "saved or created between 2.4 and 3.6 million jobs as of the first quarter of 2011." It also tallies the sum of the stimulus bill’s outlays and tax cuts at $666 billion. The $278,000 per job figure doesn’t appear anywhere in the White House report. To come up with that number, the publication divided the $666 billion stimulus total by the low-end 2.4 million job estimate to come up with a dollars per job statistic that it rounded off to $278,000. The blog item contends this statistic "provides further evidence that President Obama’s ‘stimulus’ did very little, if anything, to stimulate the economy and a whole lot to stimulate the debt," and insists "the government could simply have cut a $100,000 check to everyone whose employment was allegedly made possible by the ‘stimulus’ and taxpayers would have come out $427 billion ahead." After Republicans began to circulate the blog item, White House spokeswoman Jay Carney said its conclusions were "based on partial information and simply false analysis." White House spokeswoman Liz Oxhorn issued a statement that noted the Recovery Act bolstered infrastructure, education, and industries "that are critical to America’s long-term success and an investment in the economic future of America’s working families." The White House points out that Recovery Act dollars didn’t just fund salaries - as the blog item implies - it also funded numerous capital improvements and infrastructure projects. Lumping all costs together and classifying it as salaries produces an inflated figure. Furthermore, the publication created its statistic with the report’s low end jobs estimate. Had it instead gone with the 3.6 million job figure at the top end of the range, it would have come up with a smaller $185,000 per job figure. Republicans made a similar assertion in November 2009, using similar calculations to contend that the stimulus cost taxpayers more than $246,000 per job. Back then, they divided $160 billion in stimulus spending by 650,000 jobs that the White House estimated the measure had created or preserved. A "fact check" conducted at the time by the Associated Press called that math "satisfyingly simple but highly misleading." "Any cost-per-job figure pays not just for the worker, but for the material, supplies and that workers’ output - a portion of a road paved, patients treated in a health clinic, goods shipped from a factory floor, railroad tracks laid," the 2009 Associated Press item noted. The Weekly Standard claimed that the stimulus actually "has been working in reverse the last six months, causing the economy to shed jobs." It derives this conclusion from the fact that as of two quarters ago, the stimulus had added or saved just under 2.7 million jobs - or 288,000 more than it has now. Moody’s chief economist Mark Zandi says the Weekly Standard misinterpreted that data. "It’s not that ARRA [the stimulus] is now costing the economy jobs, it is that the economy is now creating jobs without ARRA’s help," Zandi told TPMDC. "This is exactly the objective of fiscal stimulus, namely to end recession and jump-start economic recovery." The day after the White House responded to the GOP’s dissemination of the Weekly Standard blog item, its author penned a defense that reiterates his claims. He says he never said that $278,000 per job went to salaries, but "rather that each job has cost taxpayers $278,000." Yet, his original item did say taxpayers would have come out $427 billion ahead if the government had simply "cut a $100,000 check to everyone whose employment was allegedly made possible by the ‘stimulus?’" So where does that leave Boehner’s tweet -- and the identical claim from the NRCC -- that a report said the stimulus had cost $278,000 per job? The figure attributed to the president’s economists does not appear anywhere in the White House report. Rather, the Weekly Standard attributed the number to economists at the White House after it made its own calculations and conclusions. The methodology used to get that number was previously termed suspect because it lumps all costs associated with stimulus projects together as if they are wages, suggesting it would have been cheaper to just "cut a $100,000 check" to each person who found work as a result of the stimulus. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate the tweet (and the subsequent variations of the claim) as False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-10170	Henry Kissinger "said that we should meet with Iran — guess what — without precondition."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/27/barack-obama/kissinger-and-obama-arent-really-on-the-same-page/	From the start of his campaign, Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama has said that as president he would personally negotiate with the leaders of rogue states who have long been denied face-to-face meetings with U.S. presidents, such as Iran. Sen. John McCain raised the issue during the first presidential debate, arguing that Obama's willingness to meet with dictators — without conditions — would provide enemies of the United States, like Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, with a platform to spread propaganda. Ahmadinejad, McCain pointed out, has called for the destruction of Israel and denied that the Holocaust ever happened. McCain's point, notably, is one on which he agrees with New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, who differed with Obama on the same issue during the Democratic primaries. To parry McCain's criticism at the debate, Obama said that McCain's own foreign policy adviser, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who served under President Richard Nixon, has called for high-level negotiations with Iran, without condition. And Obama's statement suggests that Kissinger was supporting presidential-level negotiations. Here's what Obama said: "So let's talk about this. First of all, Ahmadinejad is not the most powerful person in Iran. So he may not be the right person to talk to. But I reserve the right, as president of the United States to meet with anybody at a time and place of my choosing if I think it's going to keep America safe. "And I'm glad that Senator McCain brought up the history, the bipartisan history of us engaging in direct diplomacy. "Senator McCain mentioned Henry Kissinger, who's one of his advisers, who, along with five recent secretaries of state, just said that we should meet with Iran — guess what — without precondition. This is one of your own advisers." McCain opposes direct, president-to-president meetings with Ahmadinejad; Obama favors them. Kissinger may differ with McCain on when negotiations should begin – the Sept. 20, 2008, remarks Kissinger made on CNN, which Obama was referencing, aren't entirely clear – but he did not endorse a meeting between the presidents of Iran and the United States. Here's what Kissinger said during the CNN forum with other secretaries of state at George Washington University: "Well, I am in favor of negotiating with Iran. And one utility of negotiation is to put before Iran our vision of a Middle East, of a stable Middle East, and our notion on nuclear proliferation at a high enough level so that they have to study it. And, therefore, I actually have preferred doing it at the secretary of state level so that we — we know we're dealing with authentic," Kissinger said. "At a very high level right out of the box?" asked moderator Frank Sesno. "Initially, yes," Kissinger said. "And I always believed that the best way to begin a negotiation is to tell the other side exactly what you have in mind and what you are — what the outcome is that you're trying to achieve so that they have something that they can react to. Now, the permanent members of the Security Council, plus Japan and Germany, have all said nuclear weapons in Iran are unacceptable. They've never explained what they mean by this. So if we go into a negotiation, we ought to have a clear understanding of what is it we're trying to prevent. What is it going to do if we can't achieve what we're talking about?" Kissinger then added, "But I do not believe that we can make conditions for the opening of negotiations. We ought, however, to be very clear about the content of negotiations and work it out with other countries and with our own government." That would seem to differ from McCain's position. McCain has made clear he would hold "no unconditional summits." After the debate, the McCain campaign was quick to say that Obama had incorrectly described Kissinger's remarks, issuing a statement from Kissinger that said, "I would not recommend the next president of the United States engage in talks with Iran at the presidential level.” Obama is right that Kissinger supports meetings without preconditions, but he neglects to mention that Kissinger specified they would be "at the secretary of state level." And Obama's comments imply that he was referring to meetings at the presidential level. So we find Obama's statement to be Half True.

pomt-05083	The Medicaid expansion is "going to cost Florida $1.9 billion a year."	false	/florida/statements/2012/jul/02/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-medicaid-expansion-will-cost-state/	Gov. Rick Scott announced June 29, 2012, that Florida will not expand its Medicaid program, saying that provision of the federal health care law would cost the state an additional $1.9 billion a year. "It’s going to cost Florida $1.9 billion a year," Scott said July 2, 2012, while co-hosting CNBC’s Squawk Box. Scott repeated the $1.9 billion claim on Fox News June 29 and July 2, on CNN July 1 and in a July 1 official statement. Don’t believe it. Scott’s Medicaid figure is an oversimplified estimate that relies on several assumptions and ignores how the Medicaid expansion would actually be implemented. Even if you believe the assumptions and ignore how the law would be implemented, Scott is still quoting the wrong number, according to an estimate created by his own Agency for Health Care Administration. By now, you’ve probably read about the proposed Medicaid expansion, which was part of the 2010 federal health care law. But you’ve also likely missed some critical details in the few paragraphs of background you’ve seen. Medicaid is a joint state-federal, government-run health care program for the very poor. (Its cousin, Medicare, is for senior citizens of any income level.) Medicaid is an entirely voluntary program for the states -- but every state participates -- in part because of the good financial terms. The federal government covers about 55 percent of all Medicaid costs in Florida and covered about 68 percent in recent years with additional stimulus funding. The health care law required states to expand eligibility to Medicaid by raising income eligibility limits to 133 percent of the federal poverty level. States currently have widely varying thresholds depending on a person’s age and situation, and Florida has some of the strictest thresholds in the country. For instance, childless adults cannot receive Medicaid in Florida, and parents who have children must make less than 22 percent of the federal poverty level to receive Medicaid. (That means a single parent of one would have to make less than about $3,500 a year to qualify for Medicaid in Florida.) The federal government agreed to fund 100 percent of the cost for states to expand Medicaid for three budget years. The federal government would cover 95 percent of the costs in 2017, 94 percent of the costs in 2018, 93 percent of the costs in 2019 and 90 percent of the costs in 2020 and beyond. The expansion, too, was technically voluntary, but the federal government said it would penalize any state (by withholding Medicaid funds) that failed to comply. That penalty was declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court on June 28, 2012. The court’s ruling allows states like Florida to decline expansion without losing any current funding. That brings us back to Scott. His own Agency for Health Care Administration attempted to quantify the financial impact to the state because of the changes to Medicaid (which is quite different than the expansion of Medicaid Scott is talking about). We received a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation of the agency’s findings, dated Jan. 4, 2012. The state first assumed that there are people who currently qualify for Medicaid, pre-expansion, but have not enrolled for one reason or another. They would come forward, however, in the new system. The cost to Florida: $516 million a year. The state also figured that there are people currently privately purchasing insurance who would abandon their private plans because they would be eligible for Medicaid as part of the expansion. That would cost Florida another $90 million a year. And of course the state estimated the number of people who would be eligible for the Medicaid expansion and would apply. The cost: $500 million. Most of these costs, mind you, would not kick in until 2020 -- a fact Scott ignores. That said, the state estimates the Medicaid expansion -- which the state says would provide health insurance for an additional 2 million Floridians -- would cost about $1 billion a year starting in 2020. More than half of that cost, however, would come from people who today are eligible for Medicaid but have not yet enrolled. That cost could come whether or not Florida agrees to participate in the Medicaid expansion. The state health care agency lumps in another $400 million in costs each year for increased rates for Medicaid primary care physicians in its report. But we’re not sure why. The rate increase was part of the federal health care law -- not the Medicaid expansion -- as a way to make reimbursement rates the same for Medicare and Medicaid patients. But the rate increase was only temporary for 2013 and 2014, and was fully funded by the federal government. Florida could decide to continue paying higher reimbursement rates, but it is not required to. So the state’s most generous estimate is that the Medicaid changes as part of the federal health care law will cost the state about $1.47 billion a year starting in 2020. But really, the expansion to Medicaid -- the part Scott is fighting -- would cost the state about a little more than $500 million once it’s fully implemented in 2020, according to the state. (We should note that a Tallahassee group called the Florida Center for Fiscal and Economic Policy has criticized the state estimates, saying its figures are "hyper-inflated." We're not taking a side on the estimates as a whole as it pertains to this fact-check.) The nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation put the additional cost to the state between $1.2 billion and $2.5 billion between 2014 and 2019, which is roughly between $200 million and $400 million a year. That would help insure between 950,000 and 1.3 million Floridians. (Kaiser did not calculate a cost to the state in 2020, when Florida would pay for 10 percent of the expansion.) Our ruling In triumphantly declaring that Florida will reject a provision of the federal health care law that expands Medicaid coverage, Gov. Rick Scott told national television audiences that the expansion would cost Florida $1.9 billion a year. The most recent estimate from the state health care agency says a series of changes to Medicaid could wind up costing about $1.4 billion a year, but that number includes things beyond the expansion to Medicaid that Scott was talking about. For instance, about $400 million is tied to increased reimbursement payments to Medicaid providers. But the state isn't required to pay that out. And another estimated $516 million will pay for people who are eligible for Medicaid under its current provisions but have not enrolled. They would remain eligible whether or not the program is expanded in Florida. That leaves about $500 million in estimated new costs for Medicaid patients under the federal government expansion. And that cost would not fully kick in until 2020. So yes, the Medicaid expansion will cost the state. But Scott’s $1.9 billion claim appears to be wildly high. We rate this claim False.

pomt-10561	"8 years of the Clintons, major losses for Democrats across the nation."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/11/barack-obama/cumulatively-major-losses/	Raising the prospect that a Hillary Clinton presidency will weaken the Democratic party nationally, a mailer sent on behalf of Barack Obama in the days before Super Tuesday spells out how many governorships and congressional seats the party lost during the eight years of Bill Clinton's presidency. "8 years of the Clintons, major losses for Democrats across the nation," the mailer read, comparing the number of Democratic governors, U.S. senators and representatives after the 1992 and 2000 elections. It shows Democrats lost 12 governorships, seven Senate and 46 House seats over that span. Factually, the mailer's claims are borne out in breakdowns by the Senate, Clerk of the House and Congressional Quarterly, using 1993 and 2001 as the reference years. Many of the Democratic losses came in the 1994 election cycle, when voters dealt a stunning rebuke to Clinton's first-term policies and put Republicans in control of both houses of Congress for the first time in 40 years. But the GOP began to lose congressional seats in the 1996 and 1998 elections, while Clinton still was in office. And just months after he departed, the Senate shifted back to Democratic control after Vermont Sen. Jim Jeffords switched his affiliation from Republican to Independent. While it's true that Democrats suffered major losses in 1994, they recouped some of those seats before Clinton left office. We find the claim to be Mostly True.

pomt-07092	"Seventy of Ohio's 88 counties now have more than 25 percent of their residents eligible for emergency food."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/jun/24/dennis-kucinich/rep-dennis-kucinich-says-one-quarter-residents-qua/	A report by the Government Accountability Office on potential duplication of federal programs led the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee to call a hearing on welfare spending. Two Ohio congressmen took lead roles that showed contrasting approaches to the subject. Chairman Jim Jordan, a Republican whose 4th District includes a broad swath of conservative countryside in the central and western Ohio, accurately characterized the GAO report when he said it "concluded that not enough is known about the effectiveness of many of these programs." Jordan has introduced H.R. 1167, the Welfare Reform Act of 2011, which would change eligibility requirements and reduce funding. The committee's ranking member, Rep. Dennis Kucinich, whose heavily Democratic 10th District includes part of Cleveland and several urban suburbs, said the GAO report "did not find waste, fraud and abuse in the administration and delivery of these programs. It does not recommend delivering fewer benefits to those in need." Jordan asked if Kucinich agreed the government should be able to determine if programs are effective and make sure they do not "encourage the wrong kind of behavior." Kucinich replied that the issues can be examined "while we keep feeding people" during a time of continuing need. And he offered statistics to illustrate that need. "Seventy of Ohio's 88 counties now have more than 25 percent of their residents eligible for emergency food," he said. PolitiFact Ohio decided to take check that claim out. Kucinich's office referred us to recent reports from the Ohio Association of Community Action Agencies and the Ohio Association of Second Harvest Foodbanks, using data from the Ohio Department of Development. The starting point for the figure is poverty, defined in the OACAA report as a state of deprivation in which a person or family lacks sufficient resources for a minimally adequate standard of living. The 2009 federal poverty threshold for a family of four with two children was a household income of $21,756. Higher up the scale of economic well-being is the self-sufficiency level, or the income that a household needs to meet its basic needs without public or private assistance. That is generally considered to be about 200 percent of the federal poverty level, and is a ceiling for eligibility for food assistance programs. The Ohio Department of Development data shows that in 70 of the state's 88 counties, at least 25 percent of their citizens live at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level -- and are therefore eligible for emergency food. The level drops below 20 percent in only three counties -- Medina, Delaware and Warren -- but tops 45 percent in five: Adams, Meigs, Morgan, Pike and Vinton. In rural Morgan County, 51 percent of residents live below the self-sufficiency level. The data shows that Kucinich’s statement is both accurate and not lacking significant details. On the Truth-O-Meter, his claim rates as True.	None	Dennis Kucinich	None	None	None	2011-06-24T06:00:00	2011-06-01	['Ohio']
pomt-11656	Says a "recent analysis" showed that 91 percent of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients are employed, in school or serving in the military.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2018/jan/10/julian-castro/julian-castro-daca-recipients-employed-school-mili/	Calling out Republicans, Julián Castro of Texas said research shows that nearly every young immigrant at risk of losing federal protection from deportation is employed, in school or serving in the military. According to an October 2017 web post, the former Housing and Urban Development secretary was generally urging the Republican-led Congress to change federal law by offering a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children or those who overstayed their visas. The post on the conservative blog PJ Media says that in a conference call organized by an advocacy group, Castro specified that a "recent analysis" showed that 91 percent of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients, sometimes called "Dreamers," are employed, in school or serving in the military. Critics, conversely, sometimes characterize the program as an illegal amnesty that harms the working class. Castro, the former San Antonio mayor and 2020 Democratic presidential prospect, directed his call for DACA action at U.S. Rep. Will Hurd, R-San Antonio, as well as John Cornyn of Texas, the Senate majority whip, who, Castro said, "should make sure Congress passes a DREAM Act soon." Castro, who joined the faculty of the University of Texas Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs in 2017, was otherwise quoted in the post criticizing President Donald Trump for declaring the month before that his administration would discontinue DACA, which President Barack Obama launched through a 2012 memo, unless Congress authorized a program by changing federal laws. In a September 2017 tweet, Trump said both that Congress should "legalize DACA" and that in the event of inaction, he’d "revisit this issue." Castro cites online survey results So, was Castro right about DACA recipients nearly all being in school, employed or in the military? Castro, asked the basis of his claim, told Josh Baugh of the San Antonio Express-News by text that he drew his data points from an August 2017 web post by the left-leaning Center for American Progress about a national DACA survey. That survey, we found, asked if DACA recipients had jobs or were in school. It didn’t ask if respondents were in the military. The center’s post summarizing the results said Tom Wong, a political scientist at the University of California, San Diego, led the August 2017 survey of 3,063 DACA recipients. All told, the post says, the survey reached DACA recipients in 46 states including Texas, where 17 percent of respondents said they were living, according to the center’s separate post of the survey’s 22 questions and tallied results. Let’s check on whether the results back up Castro’s claim before turning to the survey methodology and other efforts to gauge how DACA recipients spend their lives. Survey results Asked if they were "currently employed," 91.4 percent answered affirmatively, according to the results, with 55.9 percent of those respondents saying they hadn’t been employed "before DACA." Another question asked if the respondent was currently in school; 44.9 percent responded affirmatively with 55 percent saying not, according to the results. Wong told us by email that an additional sort of the "in school" and "currently employed" responses showed 97 percent of all respondents reporting being employed or enrolled in school — with 71.5 percent of those saying that they were in school reportedly pursuing a bachelor’s degree or higher. Methodology The center said in its post that the results drew on the largest sampling of DACA recipients to date. Some perspective: the 3,000-plus respondents would have amounted to about 4/10ths of 1 percent of some 690,000 active DACA recipients reported at about that time by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Wong conducted the survey in collaboration with the center and advocacy groups United We Dream and the National Immigration Law Center. At the survey’s release, that teaming drew criticism on the right-leaning Breitbart blog, where writer Neil Munro underscored an acknowledgment in the survey’s methodology section that "it is not possible to construct a valid margin of error" for the results because "there is no phone book of undocumented immigrants." Munro counted this as an admission that the data was unreliable. In the same vein, we wondered how Wong’s team confirmed that respondents were signed up for DACA; best we could tell, beneficiaries are not revealed by the government. By phone, Wong reaffirmed the methodology described in the center’s post about the survey including that the partnering entities recruited the recipients surveyed online. Specifically, Wong said, the partners sent a web link to the survey to individuals on their respective email lists, also employing Facebook ads to ensure that self-identified DACA recipients from all over the country could participate. Recognizing that non-DACA recipients could potentially click through the survey, the researchers reported taking steps to eliminate bias and other factors that might skew the results. In the write-up posted by the center, Wong and his co-authors said that to prevent people from submitting multiple responses, they used a survey platform that prevented an IP address from submitting multiple responses. Wong said he used another tactic to stop people from gaming the study: Near the beginning of the survey, each respondent was asked to say at which age she or he came to the U.S. Close to the end, the survey requested the year the respondent came to the U.S. If the age provided toward the survey’s start matched the year offered later, the results stayed in. If off by more than a year, Wong said, he threw out the response. In the end, he said, the responses of 3,063 people were tallied--with approximately 6,000 respondents’ surveys getting set aside for one reason or another. We asked Wong to provide more detail perhaps enabling us to confirm the percentages in the results. Wong told us by email that he hadn’t talked to the study’s outreach partners "about what data can and can’t be released." Wong also said he plans to write a book analyzing the first four years of his survey results, at which point the data he analyzes for the book will be made publicly available. "I know talk isn’t worth much, but I analyzed all of the data myself and stand by the results," Wong wrote. Solid research, expert says We separately asked Ernesto Castañeda, an American University expert on migration research, if he considers the Wong-led results to be valid. Castañeda’s answer: Yes. Wong and his colleagues "carried out a valid study on a hard-to-reach population," Castañeda said by email. "With more than three thousand respondents, this is an exceptionally large sample size." Castañeda further said that researchers cannot always calculate margins of error for "unknown populations" like homeless and undocumented people, adding that the authors "took a number of steps to avoid duplicates or dubious data." Castañeda told us too that the study’s results appeared to be consistent with ethnographic research on DACA recipients and survey and interview research through 2016 by Roberto Gonzales, a Harvard University expert on immigration and social inequality, suggesting that DACA recipients made gains after getting that designation. Wong and Gonzales each found DACA beneficiaries finding educational and career opportunities that had been closed to them before they entered the program. According to Gonzales’ study, posted by the center in June 2017, "DACA beneficiaries told the authors that they were able to match their education and training with work that was meaningful to them—‘an occupation that they could be proud of and that did not carry the stigma of ‘immigrant work.’ " Wong told us a result from his 2017 study stood out to him: 54.2 percent of respondents reported getting a job "that better fits my education and training." In the Breitbart post critical of Wong’s work, Munro wrote that the study was "based on a skewed sample of relatively successful DACA illegals who were identified by advocacy groups." To Munro’s point, 35.5 percent of respondents 25 and older reported having bachelor’s degrees or higher. Seemingly in contrast, Munro noted, an August 2017 Migration Policy Institute study found only 5 percent of the "immediately eligible DACA population" holding a bachelor’s degree or higher. The institute, a think tank that says it believes in the benefits of well-managed immigration, reached its "5 percent" figure by drawing on responses to the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2014 American Community Survey. Wong, asked about the possibly too-high education levels suggested by his results, pointed out that the 35.5 percent of survey-indicated DACA recipients with bachelor’s degrees came out only slightly greater than what’s lately shown for naturalized American citizens. According to bureau data from 2016, 35.2 percent of naturalized citizens — those who obtained citizenship after being born as non-citizens — reported having a bachelor’s, graduate or professional degree. DACA recipients’ high education levels make sense, Wong said, because the program requires applicants to be currently in school, have graduated from high school, have obtained a General Education Development (GED) certificate, or be an honorably discharged Coast Guard or military veteran. "We’re actually requiring them to be more educated than the general population," Wong said, adding: "Now that the DACA population is getting older, we’re talking about a pretty sizable number of college-educated individuals who are just beginning to hit their strides in their careers." Castañeda suggested by email that Wong’s survey provided more meaningful results than the MPI study, which was concerned with many more residents including individuals unlikely to seek DACA status. Castañeda wrote: "DACA recipients are by definition positively self-selected since they have to apply to the program, deal with the complex application process and requirements, and pay application fees." Another view We also asked Jessica Vaughan of the conservative-leaning Center for Immigration Studies to evaluate the survey cited by Castro. By phone, Vaughan told us that she would not be surprised that DACA recipients participate in the labor force at high rates because for many, employment was likely "a motivating factor to apply for DACA." Vaughan speculated, though, that the survey overstated the employment and education rates of DACA recipients simply by being administered online and, she suggested, drawing from people with regular online access as well as individuals with the "time and inclination to fill out such a survey." It’s reasonable, she said, to suppose that the same people would be more likely employed and well-educated. Our ruling Castro said a "recent analysis" showed that 91 percent of DACA recipients are employed, in school or serving in the military. Some 97 percent of respondents to an August 2017 online survey reported being employed or in school. However, the researchers asked no questions about military service.

pomt-10817	"Bill Richardson is the only major Democratic candidate with a plan to withdraw all American troops from Iraq. All of the other major Democratic candidates support leaving American troops in Iraq indefinitely."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/23/bill-richardson/richardson-wants-all-troops-out/	Bill Richardson claims for himself a place among the top tier candidates (Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and John Edwards) as he seeks to distinguish himself from the field on Iraq, saying he is alone among this group to want to withdraw all the troops. The distinction is real. The others candidate want to leave residual forces in Iraq to be on hand for peacekeeping purposes or in case terrorists mount an offensive. Richardson says a small force will be ineffective, and all troops should come home. But we feel compelled to point out that Richardson's poll numbers have never put him in league with Clinton, Obama or Edwards. A Sept. 16 Gallup Poll showed him with 5 percent support, a good six points shy of Edwards' 11 percent, and well behind Clinton and Obama. That leaves Richardson in the single digits, along with Sen. Joe Biden and Rep. Dennis Kucinich. Of those two rivals, Richardson's position is not significantly different from Kucinich on questions of withdrawal and timetables. Kucinich advocates a prompt withdrawal of U.S. troops to be replaced with international peace keepers. Biden, on the other hand, has proposed an elaborate plan for partitioning Iraq into self-governing regions with U.S. troops helping maintain order. We won't take any points off for Richardson's claim to be among the "major" candidates here, but we will lower his Truth-O-Meter rating because the other candidates have not said they want troops in Iraq indefinitely, as Richardson suggests. Instead, they have said they need the information a commander-in-chief gets to make a final decision on force levels in Iraq. It may be a fine distinction, but it's not the same thing as supporting an indefinite deployment.

pomt-11801	Says the Austin school district "enjoys the highest per-student funding of all large Texas districts" even after forwarding tax revenue to the state.	false	/texas/statements/2017/nov/17/roger-falk/taxpayer-incorrectly-says-austin-school-district-t/	An activist made his case against voters approving a record $1 billion Austin school bond proposition in part by saying the school district tops other big Texas districts in per-student funding. We wondered about that. "Austin ISD has the highest taxable property value per student of all school districts in Texas," Roger Falk of the Travis County Taxpayers Union wrote in a November 2017 commentary published a few days before the bond won voter approval. "It also has the lowest tax rate of all districts in our area." Falk then rebutted the school district’s complaints that it suffers under the state’s school-finance system of recapture, which essentially shifts money from districts with strong property tax bases (like Austin) to property-poor districts. "A major part of its sales pitch is that recapture is killing the district and driving this bond," Falk wrote. "Recapture, as an argument from the district, actually shows its incompetence, as Austin ISD enjoys the highest per-student funding of all large Texas districts after recapture." We’re not fact-checking all that Falk said there. But by email, Falk told us he reached his conclusion about the Austin district having the highest per-student funding among large districts by checking on 2016-17 per-student budgeted spending in a dozen high-enrollment districts starting from a Texas Education Agency website. We confirmed from TEA figures posted for the Austin district that the district budgeted $10,949 per student--an amount reached by dividing $906,180,314 shown in AISD state, local and federal receipts by its 82,766 students. That disregards $406 million in local taxes recaptured by the state. Falk said that from TEA-posted figures, he identified only one high-enrollment district with a greater per-student figure; the 157,787-student Dallas district, per the site, drew $11,377 in receipts per student. Falk told us he found from posted figures that 10 other districts--including Houston, San Antonio, Fort Worth, El Paso and Corpus Christi--drew less in receipts per student. "First or second, my central point remains true: AISD uses recapture to give the impression they have unfair and inadequate funding," Falk said. "Based on their peers, many of whom don't pay recapture, they have superior funding along with a low tax rate." We confirmed that most of the districts Falk reviewed are classified by the state as "major urban" districts, although that classification doesn’t apply to all the districts in his comparison. The exceptions are the Katy, Cypress-Fairbanks, Aldine and Corpus Christi districts. We also learned more precision was possible. Taking into account all funds Next, we asked the state education agency and a couple of school funding experts who advocate for districts at the Capitol to assess Falk’s statement and methodology. By email, TEA spokesperson DeEtta Culbertson said Falk’s per-student figures, based on 2016-17 budgeted data submitted to the state, were accurate to a degree. Culbertson said, for instance, the posted data didn’t reflect final totals of federal funds fielded by each district. She subsequently emailed us a spreadsheet showing that districts ultimately got far more, or less, federal aid than indicated in the reports Falk drew upon. In response to our inquiry, agency experts reviewed audited actual spending data, including federal aid, for the latest available year, 2015-16. By this sort, Culbertson said, Austin fell to eighth among the dozen districts singled out by Falk with $10,805 in per-student spending. Culbertson provided a chart indicating the San Antonio district topped the sampled districts with per-student spending of $12,430. At the low end, the Fort Worth ($10,507); Cypress-Fairbanks ($10,395); Corpus Christi ($10,216) and Arlington ($10,171) districts spent less per student than the Austin district. Also to our inquiry, lobbyist Joe Wisnoski, a former education agency official expert in school finance, similarly said the TEA data cited by Falk was incomplete, leaving unconsidered "a lot of federal funds" spent by districts. Like the education agency, Wisnoski turned to audited district revenues for 2015-16 showing Austin eighth in per-student revenue of all kinds among the districts analyzed by Falk, though his review indicated Austin was sixth if federal aid wasn’t considered. Wisnoski also advised: "Spending can vary from revenues in a given year and result in a different ranking." Wisnoski said too that the revenue amounts "would include money for both operations and debt service," a reference to what districts put into paying off bond debt rather than paying for day-to-day operations. Also, Wisnoski wrote, the "amounts per student are without regard to any variance in the educational needs of, or program participation of, the students in the listed districts." By email, Tom Canby of the Texas Association of School Business Officials concurred with Wisnoski’s analysis. Focusing on state’s highest-enrollment districts For our part, we noticed that Falk’s sampling left out a few of the state’s 12 highest-enrollment districts: in 2016-17, the latest year of state-posted counts, these were the Northside and North East districts in Bexar County, the Conroe district in Montgomery County and the Fort Bend district in Fort Bend County. Folding in actual per-student financial data for Falk’s listed districts and for these other districts led us to compose a chart showing the Austin district in 2015-16 trailed eight of the state’s highest-enrollment districts in such spending. Within the sample, the San Antonio district had the greatest per-student figure, at $12,430, followed by the Dallas, Katy, Houston, Ysleta, North East, El Paso and Aldine districts--before the Austin district. Focusing on the 10 largest districts by enrollment puts Austin sixth in per-student revenue, with the Dallas district leading at $12,069 per student. TEN HIGHEST-ENROLLMENT TEXAS SCHOOL DISTRICTS DISTRICT 2015-16 All Funds Total Revenue/Student DALLAS $12,069 KATY $11,568 HOUSTON $11,450 NORTH EAST $10,921 ALDINE $10,905 AUSTIN $10,805 NORTHSIDE $10,722 FORT WORTH $10,507 FORT BEND $10,419 CYPRESS-FAIRBANKS $10,395 SOURCES: Email, DeEtta Culbertson, information specialist, Texas Education Agency, Nov. 13, 2017 and PolitiFact Texas research starting from a TEA website, "PEIMS District Financial Actual Reports, 2015-16," accessed Nov. 15, 2017 We shared the information provided by the agency and Wisnoski with Falk. He replied by email: "In my goal to provide accurate, thoughtful counterpoint, I defer to those I use for reference, like TEA," which collects and analyzes data. "If they differ with the assessment, I accept their numbers and gladly stand corrected." Falk followed up: "My point could have been made by simply saying ‘similar funding to other large districts’ or something to that effect." Our ruling Falk said the Austin district "enjoys the highest per-student funding of all large Texas districts" even after forwarding revenue to the state. Considering all audited actual revenues for 2015-16, it looks to us like the Austin district trailed other high-enrollment districts in spending--ranking sixth or ninth among such districts depending on which ones you include.

pomt-14886	Obamacare insurance cooperative failures "should be expected" because they're like any business, and "when you start businesses in America, at the fifth year, half of the businesses have closed."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2015/nov/10/ezekiel-emanuel/did-obamacare-insurance-co-ops-fail-faster-average/	It’s sign-up time for Obamacare and while the website is clicking along and the program has succeeded in reducing the ranks of the uninsured, there is one notable sore spot: A $2.4 billion effort to provide low-cost insurance through consumer owned insurance cooperatives is in deep trouble. Out of the 23 co-ops largely funded through Obamacare by federal loans, 12 will no longer offer policies after this year. Republican critics of the president’s signature health care law have focused on these failures. But a staunch defender of the Affordable Care Act, Zeke Emanuel, brother of President Barack Obama’s former chief of staff and bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania, downplayed the bad news on MSNBC. "When you start businesses in America, at the fifth year, half of the businesses have closed," Emanuel said on Nov. 3, 2015. "The idea that some of these co-ops are going to work and some aren’t should be expected. That's what business is about. The idea that 100 percent will succeed is a false metric we don't hold the private sector to." We decided to dig into Emanuel’s notion that a 50-percent failure rate after five years for businesses applies to these insurance co-ops. Where the co-ops came from When Congress passed the Affordable Care Act, it included $6 billion in loans to launch Consumer Owned and Oriented Plans. The vision was to create nonprofit health insurance companies that would provide low-cost, high quality policies to individuals and small businesses. Without the need to produce a return on investment, these enterprises would, in theory, be able to compete against the major generally for-profit players in the market. In fact, in places where competition was scant, these co-ops would help the market deliver better value for all consumers. Throughout 2012 and 2013, the U.S. Health and Human Services Department approved loans to get the co-ops up and running. After a series of budget cuts, program funding was capped at $2.4 billion. In 2013, the co-ops began selling policies to provide coverage in 2014. The dates are important because it’s doubtful any of these co-ops were five years old as of 2015. If they weren’t five years old, then Emanuel’s benchmark might not be as suitable as he suggested. Emanuel told us that the co-ops launched before 2012. "Many of these co-ops were started in 2011 and were doing a lot of work to get ready," Emanuel told PunditFact. "To apply for a loan, you had to do some serious analysis about the market and costs. You needed to have a business plan." On the other hand, Emanuel said there isn’t any perfect comparison data to work with. His real point he said was "to give some context for the closures," and "to focus on when they began is to miss the forest for the trees." "Their age? They were somewhere north of three years old," he told us. Scott Harrington is a business professor who focuses on health care finance at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. "Some of the co-ops didn’t even last two years," Harrington said. We looked at the data to help resolve this. Failures accumulate For several decades, the U.S. Census Bureau has tracked the births and deaths of firms in the Business Dynamics Statistics database. We crunched the numbers in two ways -- for all firms and for firms in the finance, insurance and real estate business. That industry group -- known by the acronym FIRE -- is broader than you would want but it’s the closest match to see how the insurance co-ops stack up against approximately similar kinds of firms. The bottom line is that after five years, about 44 percent of all businesses have disappeared. So Emanuel was pretty close when he said about half have closed. But as you might expect, the younger the companies, the lower the failure rate. Here are the average rates from 2000 to 2007, based on Census business data. (We didn’t include 2008 or 2009 because closings spiked during the Great Recession.) Average firm failure rate 2000-2007 After 1 year After 2 years After 3 years After 4 years After 5 years All firms 17% 27% 34% 40% 44% FIRE industry 16% 26% 34% 40% 45% So Emanuel’s comparison ultimately boils down to how old the co-ops were. There is no perfect answer. Emanuel said they existed when they began doing the research to apply for a federal loan. You could say they were born on the day Washington approved their loans. We used the Census Bureau definition. The Census Bureau said it treats the first year a company shows employment in its payroll tax records as the year it was born. We looked at CoOportunity Health in Iowa. It was in the first wave of loan recipients on Feb. 17, 2012. The company’s former Chief Financial Officer Stephen Ringless told us the loan award took the co-op to the next step of securing a state insurance license. When that came through, it hired a few consultants. "When the company was able to develop a payroll system in early June 2012, those consultants became full-time employees," Ringless said. Almost exactly two-and-half years later, on Jan. 29, 2015, the Iowa insurance commissioner moved to liquidate CoOportunity Health. The firm was about $50 million in the red. While some employees were retained as the firm was wound down, as a going concern, its days ended in early 2015. We did not dig into the details of all of the failed co-ops but the CoOportunity timeline seems more or less to apply to many of them. A June 2013 Inspector General’s Office report looked at the 18 co-ops funded in the first half of 2012. The federal auditors said that by the end of 2012, all of the firms were still "hiring staff, obtaining licensure, and building necessary infrastructure." By the third quarter of 2015, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reported that 12 co-ops would no longer be in business as of 2016. Given all this, it would be reasonable to say the co-ops were three years old when they failed. That would run from mid-way through 2012 -- approximately the time of funding -- until mid-way through 2015 -- approximately the time the closure process was underway. The failure rate was over 50 percent. The corresponding failure rate at the three-year mark for all American businesses and for the broader finance, insurance and real estate sector is 34 percent. The co-ops fared significantly worse than the U.S. average, failing at a rate that is about 40 percent faster than is typical. Harrington at the University of Pennsylvania noted one other significant difference between the co-ops and the typical American start-up. "How many firms launch with heavy subsidies from the government?" he asked. Our ruling Emanuel said the Obamacare insurance co-ops failed at a rate that’s typical for American businesses over a five-year period. The underlying comparison is flawed. While the age of each co-op is subject to debate, we used the Census Bureau’s definition to determine when they were born. Interviews with experts, government audits, and regulators’ actions point to three years as the typical lifespan of a failed co-op. About 50 percent of the co-ops shut down. Compared to the three-year failure rate in America, the co-ops have done much worse -- cratering at a rate that is about 40 percent faster than average. But Emanuel could turn out to be right. We won’t know the five-year rate for the entire group until late in 2016 or early 2017. If the remaining co-ops are still running, then the group’s failure rate will be close to the national average. Emanuel’s statement is accurate regarding the five-year-average but leaves out important details. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-04400	Says his administration has created "5 million jobs … over the last 30 months in the private sector alone."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/17/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-his-administration-has-created-5/	Early in the second presidential debate at Hofstra University, President Barack Obama answered a question from a young voter seeking reassurance that he will be able to find a job after he graduates. Obama responded in part, "And what I want to do is build on the 5 million jobs that we've created over the last 30 months in the private sector alone." Job-creation statistics have been bitterly contested terrain between the campaigns this election cycle, with each trying to frame the question in a way that paints their side most favorably. For example, Mitt Romney’s campaign ran an ad recently that said, "Since President Obama took office, there are over 450,000 more unemployed women." We rated that statement Half True, because the number was correct by one method, but way off by others. Obama’s claim from the debate suffers from the same problem. If you start at the low point in the private-sector job market -- February 2010, which is 31 months ago -- then Obama has presided over the net creation of 4.7 million jobs. But that means starting the count more than a year after Obama took office, which -- a little too conveniently for the president -- removes all of the job losses from his first year off his ledger. Another way of doing it would be to start with January 2009, when Obama was sworn in. By this count, the nation has gained a net 514,000 private-sector jobs -- an amount only one-tenth the size of what Obama claimed. However, this method has its drawbacks, because no president can have much impact in the first few months on the job. A middle-ground position is to start the count at the official beginning of the recovery, which came in June 2009. From June 2009 until today, the nation has gained roughly 3.6 million private-sector jobs. That’s less than Obama claims, but more than the inauguration-day calculation the Romney camp often prefers. It's also worth noting that economists say that presidents have a relatively modest impact on the ups and downs of jobs, so it can be a stretch to give Obama either credit for good job numbers or blame for weak job numbers. A final note: Private-sector job numbers are a credible yardstick, but they do paint a more favorable picture for the president than total job numbers do, since government jobs have been shrinking in recent years. Since June 2009, the nation has gained a little under 3 million total jobs, compared to 3.6 million using private-sector jobs alone. Our ruling Obama said that his administration has created "5 million jobs … over the last 30 months in the private sector alone." That’s true only using the most cherry-picked time frame. A more reasonable method -- starting the count at the beginning of the recovery -- shows a gain of 3.6 million jobs. That’s still a substantial number, but well short of the 5 million Obama claimed. We rate the statement Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-10-17T15:04:50	2012-10-16	['None']
pomt-00328	Says Michigan congressional candidate Elissa Slotkin "just parachuted into the district to run for Congress" and "admitted that she doesn’t know our area."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/sep/19/mike-bishop/campaign-ad-accuses-elissa-slotkin-carpetbagging/	It has been 18 years since a Democrat held the U.S. House seat in Michigan’s 8th Congressional District. Even so, the race between political newcomer Elissa Slotkin and incumbent Mike Bishop is viewed as a bellwether in the fight for control of the U.S. House in November. Slotkin, a former Central Intelligence Agency analyst, is looking to unseat the two-term Republican congressman, who received 56 percent of the vote in his 2016 re-election bid. The district, which stretches from north of Detroit to the state capital Lansing, voted for President Trump with 51 percent of the vote. Slotkin is seen as a "different kind" of Democrat who served in both the Bush and Obama administrations, supports existing gun rights and criticizes single-payer health care. One argument routinely made against Slotkin — and emphasized in a recent radio ad by Bishop — is her weaker ties to the district. "What do we know about D.C. insider Elissa Slotkin? Not much, since Elissa Slotkin just parachuted into the district to run for Congress. We know that Elissa Slotkin was recruited by Nancy Pelosi and sent here from Washington. Slotkin doesn’t own a home in Michigan, and her only voting record … for herself, just a few days ago in the Michigan primary. Elissa Slotkin even admitted that she doesn’t know our area." (Audio of Slotkin's voice) "I did not know the outline of the district…" "Doesn’t know the district? Then how can Elissa Slotkin know us?" Here, we are focusing on her Michigan ties and the claim that she "doesn’t know" the district’s boundaries. She's not as much of an outsider as the ad says. Slotkin and Michigan Slotkin’s campaign calls her a third-generation Michigan native. Slotkin was born in New York, but her family returned to Michigan when she was 4 years old, the campaign said. Slotkin grew up on her family’s farm in Holly, which is located in the 8th district in Oakland County. Her great-grandfather established her family’s meat business called Hygrade Foods, which opened its Detroit headquarters in 1949. The business created a number of foods, but most famously the Ballpark Frank, first sold at Tiger Stadium. Slotkin studied at Cornell University in New York and then went to graduate school at Columbia University. She served three tours in Iraq as a Central Intelligence Agency analyst before taking on various roles in Washington in the intelligence and defense departments during the administrations of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Slotkin moved back to her family’s farm from D.C. in the spring of 2017 after her national security post ended with the Obama administration. She runs a small consulting business there called Pinpoint Consulting, according to the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs. Does Elissa Slotkin own a home in Michigan? The ad claims that Slotkin doesn’t own a home in Michigan. That is accurate, but leaves out some important context. Slotkin does not own her family’s farm herself — the deed is in the name of her father, Curtis Slotkin, Oakland County property records show. Slotkin's father and stepmother live about 30 minutes from the farm, in the Detroit suburbs of Oakland County. The farm was purchased by Slotkin’s grandfather and passed down to her father when her grandfather passed away, said Slotkin campaign spokeswoman Laura Epstein. "When Elissa’s parents pass," Epstein says, "the property will then be in her name — in line with family tradition." What about her voting record? Bishop’s ad asserts that Slotkin has only voted in Michigan once, and that was in her own primary. That statement, according to state records, is correct. Michigan Secretary of State Elections Bureau records show that Slotkin has only voted once in the state, and that was in the August primary. Does she really not know the district’s boundaries? The audio clip of Slotkin talking about the district’s outlines is from a town hall event sponsored by the NAACP Lansing chapter, according to Bishop campaign consultant Stu Sandler. It is clear the audio is clipped. Slotkin said she "did not know the outline of the district," even though the ad's retort of "doesn't" makes the listener think she still doesn't know. We were unable to obtain a full recording from that event. However, at a campaign volunteer event on July 7, Slotkin can be heard saying something similar, that she "didn’t know, probably a year and a half ago, the exact boundaries of the district." She then goes on to review the district’s outlines. Epstein told PolitiFact that Slotkin frequently introduces herself by giving a lay of the land at the beginning of an event and sometimes starts by talking about the district lines. Our ruling Bishop’s ad portrays Slotkin as a "Washington insider" who parachuted into the district to run for the U.S. House. It also utilized an audio clip to allege she doesn’t know the outlines of the district. On some of the technical claims, the ad is accurate. Slotkin has only voted once in the state (in her own primary race), and she is not a Michigan homeowner. However, the ad leaves out important details about her childhood background in the district, and takes her words at a campaign event out of context. The home where she lives is owned by her parents on her family farm, and is slated to be passed down to her. The ad's soundbite is clipped to make it sound like Slotkin admitted to not knowing the outlines of her own district. A similar Slotkin statement shows she may not have known the boundaries before moving back to the state, but she does now. We rate the claim Half True. Update, Sept. 24, 2018: This report was updated to include Slotkin's birth in New York. The rating remains the same.

pomt-06623	Says that even if you have no children, "under Obamacare, you would still have to carry insurance that covers pediatric, maternity and newborn care even though you do not need it."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2011/sep/19/mary-taylor/lt-gov-mary-taylor-says-obamacare-would-require-pu/	Ohio Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor also heads the state Department of Insurance. She makes no secret of her dislike for what she derisively calls "Obamacare," the law formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. In June, Taylor wrote a guest column for newspapers in which she said, "I will do everything I can to protect Ohio’s citizens and job creators from this catastrophic law." She followed it by giving a speech with a similar theme. In another guest column for newspapers that was posted Sept. 8 to the Department of Insurance website, Taylor says the health care law will limit choice and increase cost for consumers. "The law’s heavy-handed mandates force insurance companies to include coverage for many benefits and services you may not want," she wrote. "Say for example, you do not have any children. Under Obamacare, you would still have to carry insurance that covers pediatric, maternity and newborn care even though you do not need it. "Such mandates remove consumerism from the process and replace it with a one-size-fits-all approach. By requiring consumers to buy services they do not want or need, costs will rise significantly." That got PolitiFact Ohio’s attention. Would consumers really be forced to buy unnecessary coverage, like pediatric, maternity and newborn care for people with no children? We asked Taylor's office for support. We were referred to Section 1302 of the Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. "It addresses the essential health benefits," a spokesman for Taylor said. We read Section 1302, and it seemed to bear out Taylor's assertion. But we were frankly confused by the wording, and we turned for guidance to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a trusted independent source on health care issues. "It is true that this (pediatric, maternity and newborn care) is covered as part of the essential benefits package," a spokesman told us. "The law does mandate that insurance." But the spokesman added more: Current employer-provided insurance plans "may include coverage you will never use or need, such as maternity care for a man or prostate cancer coverage for women." Wanting further explanation, we talked with Neera Tanden, who worked on the health care legislation as senior advisor for health reform at the Department of Health and Human Services. She is currently CEO of the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. "Ninety percent of all plans cover everything described in the bill as 'essential health benefits package," she said. "People are paying for all those benefits today. We all pay for things we never use. It is the nature of insurance." Individual policies are usually more expensive, offer fewer benefits and are less regulated than group plans, she said, noting that Section 1302 of the health care act says that the scope of the package should equal the scope of benefits "under a typical employer plan." The act also bans exclusions for "preexisting conditions" that exclusively or primarily affect women and ends the practice of charging women higher premiums than men, she said. "The thrust of (Taylor's) case is there should be no requirements on what insurance companies offer," Tanden said. Wanting the perspective of an authority without a dog in the political fight, we turned to J.B. Silvers at Case Western Reserve University. He is professor of health care finance and professor of banking and finance at the Weatherhead School of Management, faculty director of the Health Systems Management Center and holds a joint appointment in the School of Medicine. He also is former CEO of a health plan and insurance company. Silvers said the health care plan "makes the playing field level" by setting a standard for benefit packages. "It is true you could buy some sort of stripped-down policy," he said, but such plans are "almost universally a bad deal" with higher costs. Normally, he said, a company negotiates coverage for employees, and "wouldn't offer one plan for single males and another for people with families." What does that say about the accuracy of Taylor's statement? "It's irrelevant," Silvers said. "It's a silly argument, frankly. Insurance by definition includes things you don't think you need." What it means to us is that Taylor, the top official at the state department that oversees insurance, was accurate in describing provisions of what she calls Obamacare. But it is misleading to imply that health insurance policies are purchased a la carte, that such purchasing would reduce costs to consumers, and that the "essential benefits package" represents a departure from current group plans. And when a statement has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, it rates Mostly False on the Truth-O-Meter.

pomt-07116	Muslims tried to use Sharia law to influence court decisions in New Jersey and Oklahoma	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2011/jun/20/herman-cain/cain-claims-muslims-tried-influence-sharia-law-nj-/	Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain can’t get away from the subject of Islamic law. Reporters have been dogging him on the issue since March, when a liberal blogger asked Cain whether he’d feel comfortable appointing a Muslim to his Cabinet if he became president. Cain said he would not appoint one because Islam demands they follow Sharia law, above all others -- including the U.S. Constitution. Sharia law is a wide-ranging set of rules that govern aspects of Islamic life including religious practice, daily living, crime and financial dealings. Muslims differ on its interpretation. Later, Cain denied saying he would not appoint Muslims -- a statement PolitiFact Georgia ruled Pants on Fire. CNN anchor and moderator John King asked Cain about the subject again during the June 13 Republican primary debate in Manchester, N.H. "Are American-Muslims as a group less committed to the Constitution than, say, Christians or Jews?" King asked. "There have been instances in New Jersey -- there was an instance in Oklahoma where Muslims did try to influence court decisions with Sharia law. I was simply saying very emphatically, ‘American laws in American courts,’ " Cain replied. Have there been instances in New Jersey and Oklahoma where Muslims tried to "influence court decisions with Sharia law"? We turned to news accounts and court documents to address the issue. First, we’ll consider Oklahoma, where voters approved the "Save Our State Amendment" Nov. 2. It forbids courts from using Sharia law as well as international law when they make decisions. A judge granted a request later that month for a preliminary injunction that bars the amendment from going into effect. It is being challenged in federal appellate court. During a Nov. 22 hearing in Oklahoma federal court, state Assistant Attorney General Scott Boughton defended the amendment on behalf of the state. He conceded under questioning by a federal judge that he did not know of any instances where Sharia law was used in state courts, according to The Oklahoman newspaper. An Oct. 28 Los Angeles Times article on the proposed amendment found three cases that backers said demonstrate Sharia law is being used in U.S. courts. None of them took place in Oklahoma. A brief filed in federal court in support of the Oklahoma amendment did not assert that Sharia law had been used in Oklahoma courts. Instead, it listed one example from New Jersey. This brings us to Cain’s mention of New Jersey during the June 13 debate. In 2009, state Superior Court Judge Joseph Charles denied a woman a restraining order after she reported her husband repeatedly beat and sexually assaulted her. She and her husband are Muslim. Charles asked their imam during the injunction hearing how Islamic law applies to sexual behavior. The imam testified that a wife must comply with her husband’s sexual demands, but a husband was forbidden to approach his wife "like any animal." Charles said he denied the restraining order in part because the husband’s "desire to have sex when and whether he wanted to, was something that was consistent with his practices and it was something that was not prohibited," according to the decision. The New Jersey appeals court ruled July 23, 2010, that Charles was wrong. His decision contradicted U.S. and state Supreme Court precedent on conflicts between criminal law and religion, the ruling said. Let’s sum up. Cain was wrong on Oklahoma. Voters did pass an amendment to the state constitution that would prevent the use of Sharia law in state courts, but supporters found no instance where "Muslims did try to influence court decisions with Sharia law," as Cain said. There was a New Jersey case in which a judge considered Islamic law when he denied a request for a restraining order. However, since the issue of Islamic law arose only when the New Jersey judge questioned the couple’s imam, it is unfair to accuse Muslims of trying to "influence court decisions with Sharia law." The judge raised the subject. We rule Cain’s statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Herman Cain	None	None	None	2011-06-20T06:00:00	2011-06-13	['New_Jersey']
pomt-00212	"Of course you've got a low unemployment rate when people've got to work two and three jobs just to make ends meet."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2018/oct/15/andrew-gillum/andrew-gillum-unemployment-claim/	Gov. Rick Scott has touted a strong Florida economy built up over his two terms in office. But Andrew Gillum, the Democratic candidate seeking to replace him, says the economy is "propped up" by low wages and people working multiple jobs just to make ends meet. In an interview on CBS Miami’s "Facing South Florida," host Jim DeFede asked the Tallahassee mayor if he gave Scott any credit for the economy. "I give him credit for an economy that is largely propped up on low-wage work," Gillum said. "Of course you've got a low unemployment rate when people have got to work two and three jobs just to make ends meet." In a companion fact-check, we looked Gillum’s claim about low-wage work propping up Florida’s economy (Half True). Here, we will examine Gillum’s latter point about the low unemployment rate is propped up by people with multiple jobs. After the interview, the campaign of Gillum’s Republican rival, Ron DeSantis, cried "Pants on Fire!" to Gillum’s multiple jobs claim. The campaign was referencing our fact-check of a similar statement by Democratic congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez about the national unemployment rate. Is Gillum’s claim any better? No. It is similarly wrong. Multiple jobs Florida does have nearly full employment, with an unemployment rate of 3.7 percent as of August 2018. Gillum doesn’t see that as positively as Scott. But his point that low unemployment indicates that people are working multiple low-wage jobs to make ends meet doesn’t hold up. Official unemployment rates are not affected by the number of jobs people hold. Nationally, only a small percentage of American workers are employed at more than one job, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The number has hovered in the 4.7 to 5.2 percent range during the past 10 years. Florida’s percentage of residents with more than one job does not deviate from national trends. The number of jobs in Florida has risen 2.8 percentage points faster than the number of workers in Florida over the past eight years, based on data from the federal Household and Payroll surveys. Moody's Analytics senior economist Kwame Donaldson said that’s evidence some workers have more than one job. However, he said, Florida is ranked 26th in the United States in this measure. Nationally, the number of jobs rose 2.9 percentage points faster than the number of workers in that time period. Data about multiple job holders isn’t specific enough to draw conclusions about the quality of the jobs, according to Sean Snaith, the director of the University of Central Florida’s Institute for Economic Competitiveness. "You can have multiple jobs even if your primary job is high-paying," Snaith said. Over the past year, the number of American workers who’ve held multiple jobs has ranged between 6 million and 7 million, compared to more than 148 million who are employed in a single job. The number of jobs people hold does not affect the BLS unemployment rate. People are counted as employed as long as they hold one job. They do not get counted again if they hold more than one. "The claim about multiple jobs and unemployment is simply not true," Snaith said. Our ruling Gillum said that unemployment was low because people were working multiple jobs. Unemployment rates are not influenced by how many jobs someone holds, and not many people hold more than one job. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-08346	Of the more than 1.3 million temporary mortgage modifications, over half have defaulted.	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/oct/27/marco-rubio/rubio-claims-among-more-13-million-temporary-mortg/	Foreclosures are a rampant problem in Florida, and the next U.S. senator will be expected to help tackle the national crisis. In the final debate Oct. 26, 2010, between Florida's U.S. Senate candidates on NBC, moderator David Gregory asked Republican Marco Rubio "what would you do to solve the foreclosure problem?" During his answer, Rubio bashed the efforts of the current administration. "Over 1.3 million temporary work-outs, over half have now defaulted,'' he said. Gregory clarified what Rubio meant by "work-outs:" "Those are called mortgage modifications?" Rubio: "The temporary modifications. There have been 500,000 permanent (modifications). We just found out yesterday of the 500,000 permanent (modifications), 11 percent already defaulted." For this Truth-O-Meter we wanted to explore, did Rubio get his numbers right on the larger figure -- have there been more than 1.3 million temporary mortgage modifications of which more than half have defaulted? An Oct. 25 Associated Press article provides some answers. The article focused on comments by Neil Barofsky, special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, a $700 billion Wall Street bailout in 2008 that includes a mortgage modification program launched in 2009. According to the AP, Barofsky concluded that the administration's "foreclosure-prevention effort has been ineffective in tackling the foreclosure crisis." Barofsky issued a 338-page quarterly report about TARP to Congress on Oct. 26, the day of the debate. The report states on Page 6: "Finally, the most specific of TARP's Main Street goals, 'preserving homeownership,' has so far fallen woefully short with TARP's portion of the Administration's mortgage modification program yielding only approximately 207,000 ... ongoing permanent modifications since TARP's inception, a number that stands in stark contrast to the 5.5 million homes receiving foreclosure filings and more than 1.7 million homes that have been lost to foreclosure since January 2009." Funded through TARP, the Home Affordable Mortgage Modification Program is intended to help prevent foreclosure by modifying mortgages. By the end of September 2010, HAMP spent about $483 million in TARP money. The report shows a chart on page 74 that 1,369,414 mortgage modification trials had started by the end of September 2010. The chart states that 699,924 trials had been cancelled -- so note that is slightly more than half. The chart doesn't use the word "temporary" for any of the trials -- but it is clear that the 699,924 figure refers to temporary because another line on the chart shows that nearly 500,000 trials were converted to "permanent." Of those permanent modifications, the majority survived while almost 29,000 were cancelled. Rubio stated that the more than 1.3 million mortgage modifications were temporary. While all of the more than 1.3 million started out as temporary, about 500,000 became permanent. Rubio also said that more than half of those 1.3 million had "defaulted." But the chart doesn't state that they defaulted -- it says cancelled. We sent Rubio's claim to Matthew Anderson, spokesman for the U.S. Department of Treasury that oversees the mortgage modification program. "It is not accurate, however, to say that all canceled trials are the result of 'default,'" Anderson wrote in an e-mail. "Trial plans may be canceled for a number of reasons, only one of which is failure to make payments." Anderson pointed us to the September 2010 HAMP report that contains data from the largest service providers, which indicates the top three reasons, in order, for cancellation. Anderson listed them for us: "Borrowers not providing sufficient documentation to servicers, trial plan payment default, or a homeowner who is ineligible because their housing expense is already below the program's 31% threshold." We called and e-mailed Rubio spokesman Alex Burgos on Oct. 27. He sent us back a link to an Oct. 18, 2010, Government Sponsored Enterprises report, a publication done by the Washington, D.C., consulting firm Canfield and Associates. The GSE report stated: "As of August, only 449,000 borrowers have received permanent modifications through HAMP—34% of the 1.3 million borrowers who have enrolled in the program, while 680,000 borrowers have fallen out of the program (51%)." That report also stated that through July, incomplete requests (28 percent) and trial plan default (21 percent) were the top two reasons that trial modifications failed to convert to permanent. Rubio is familiar with the housing crisis personally. An Oct. 22 St. Petersburg Times article about his personal finances stated that Rubio's "Tallahassee home, which he bought with fellow legislator David Rivera, nearly went into foreclosure before Rivera came up with $9,525 for missed payments and fees. Rubio said the delay was over a dispute with the mortgage company." In the final full week of the U.S. Senate race, how did Rubio fare on his numbers about the mortgage modification program? Rubio said "over 1.3 million temporary work-outs, over half have now defaulted,'' referring to a temporary mortgage modification program. His claim requires some clarification -- of the more than 1.3 million mortgage modifications that started out as temporary, nearly 700,000 in the trial phase were cancelled -- or 51 percent. So Rubio is correct on "over half" but wrong to conclude that all of those had "defaulted." Defaulting was the second most common reason for cancellation, therefore we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-06586	"We have 10,000 baby boomers retiring every day."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/sep/26/john-boehner/house-speaker-john-boehner-says-10000-baby-boomers/	Since President Obama launched his offensive to tout initiatives he believes will create jobs and revive the economy, House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio has provided a steady Republican counterpoint. Boehner appeared Sept. 19, 2011, on Fox Business Network, where he described Obama’s call for higher taxes on millionaires as "class warfare," and advised the president to "tackle the spending problem." "What we’re seeing out of the president’s so-called deficit reduction package is more of the same," Boehner told interviewer Gerri Willis. "It’s class warfare, not serious about dealing with the real drivers of our debt. And that’s major entitlement programs. "We have 10,000 baby boomers retiring every day. It’s time for us to get serious about ensuring that these programs are going to be there for them." That’s a lot of retirees. PolitiFact Ohio was intrigued and took a look at the speaker’s claim. The claim is similar to one made by House Majority Leader Eric Cantor that our counterparts at PolitiFact Virginia examined. We’ll incorporate some of their findings here, too. Baby boomers comprise a large demographic group of Americans who were born between Jan. 1, 1946 and Dec. 31, 1964. Their pending departure from the workforce is expected to significantly stress the retirement system. According to the Social Security System’s Annual Performance Plan for Fiscal Year 2012: "Nearly 80 million baby boomers will file for retirement benefits over the next 20 years – an average of 10,000 per day." That bears out the statistic cited by Boehner. A 2010 Pew Research Center study says baby boomers comprise 26 percent of the total U.S. population. After 2030 - when that generation reaches retirement age - Pew projects that 18 percent of the nation’s population will be over age 65, compared with 13 percent today. Census data collected by Pew indicates the estimated number of retires could be even greater than 10,000 per day. According to Pew’s data, 76 million people were born in the United States between 1946 and 1964. After subtracting those who died and adding immigrants born during those years, America has 79.6 million people of that generation. If you divide 79.6 million by 19 years (the number remaining until 2030), then divide that by 365 days, you get a daily average of 11,476 people turning 65. Although not everyone in that age group will live to reach age 65, the amount who will end up retiring each day could significantly exceed Boehner’s 10,000 per day figure. Boehner’s statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing. We rule his claim True.	None	John Boehner	None	None	None	2011-09-26T06:00:00	2011-09-19	['None']
pomt-04945	Says PolitiFact "validated and independently documented" its "criminal history" claims about Adan Ballesteros.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2012/jul/27/texans-accountable-government/texas-group-says-politifact-validated-criminal-his/	In a July 26, 2012, email blast, a political group backing Michael Cargill for a Travis County constable post asserts that Cargill’s opponent in the July 31 Democratic primary runoff, incumbent Adan Ballesteros, has been stealing anti-Ballesteros signs. We’re not wading into signs being hoisted. But we fired up the Truth-O-Meter for the email’s citation of PolitiFact. The email from Texans for Accountable Government, which says it’s focused on reining in the reach of government, says that its anti-Ballesteros website, CocaineConstable.com, brings to light Ballesteros’ "criminal history -- including being fired from (the Texas Department of Public Safety) for allowing the trafficking of drugs and taking money from informants, the Texas Public Safety Commission sustaining the firing, and his lawsuit against them being thrown out of court for being 'baseless and retaliatory.'" The email continues: "TAG's claims were validated and independently documented recently by PolitiFact.com," the email says. Do what? We figured that this part was referring to our June 25, 2012, article on another group’s claim that Ballesteros, the county’s Precinct 2 constable, had "accepted more than $15,000 in cocaine blood money." Unlike most of our fact-checks, we ended up being unable to rate that claim. Our 2,200-word story says that the DPS dismissed Ballesteros as an employee in 1998 after seeing merit in a complaint that, years earlier, he had accepted thousands of dollars in illicit funds from a drug smuggler/informant -- a firing upheld by the Texas Public Safety Commission. However, a Texas Workforce Commission tribunal later said a grand jury found no probable cause to indict Ballesteros and also said "there is not a preponderance of evidence before this appeal tribunal to find the claimant guilty of criminal acts." The July 26 email blast makes no mention of the tribunal’s statement or of the fact that Ballesteros was not charged in criminal court. Ballesteros, who has consistently said he did not accept such funds, told us in an interview that he was investigated and fired because he refused to fire a secretary who had made sexual harassment allegations against a DPS employee. He said that he was ordered to fire the woman shortly after moving to Austin to lead DPS’s narcotics training unit in 1993 — two years before the investigation into his activities as a narcotics investigator in South Texas began. Ballesteros made the same claim in a lawsuit he filed against the DPS. U.S. District Judge James Nowlin dismissed the suit on Sept. 20, 2000, saying in his order that Ballesteros failed to offer relevant evidence. On April 2, 2001, a three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the order, writing that Ballesteros had failed to offer evidence that the DPS investigation was "baseless and motivated by retaliatory intent," as mentioned in the email blast. By telephone, we asked the group’s executive director, Heather Fazio, to elaborate on PolitiFact validating its claims, as the email says. Fazio said the reference was solely to our reporting on Ballesteros getting fired by the DPS for allegedly letting drugs into the country and taking illicit money; his firing being upheld; and his post-firing lawsuit being judged baseless. Fazio said the validation reference was not intended to say PolitiFact had confirmed the entire CocaineConstable site. Asked about the email’s reference to Ballesteros’ "criminal history" despite the fact he was not indicted, Fazio replied: "If you were fired for something that is a criminal act, just because you were not indicted doesn’t mean you were not involved in criminal activity." Beyond that, she said, the "criminal history" term reflected the group’s opinion and was not intended to signal that PolitiFact validated as much. If recipients reach such a conclusion, she said, "I guess I have to apologize for that part." Our ruling As the group’s email suggests, our story that was the basis of the email’s PolitiFact reference sketches out the complaint and investigation that preceded Ballesteros’ firing and the fact that the firing was upheld and his lawsuit found baseless. However, we did not validate Ballesteros’ "criminal history," as the group’s email can be read, and the group’s statement fails to point out he was not indicted or that the workforce commission tribunal saw no preponderance of evidence of criminal acts. Broadly, the group indicates we reached a conclusion about Ballesteros being a criminal that we did not reach. The claim rates Mostly False.

pomt-09660	"The Congressional Budget Office -- supposedly non-partisan -- estimates that in just a few years the average cost to every family of four (from cap and trade) will be $6,800 per year."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/27/chain-email/6800-cap-and-trade-not-cbo-estimate/	Critics of the Democratic cap-and-trade proposal have many complaints about the plan, but their biggest is cost. They say it will cost so much that it will be a significant burden on a typical American family. The latest variation of this comes in a chain e-mail that contends the cap-and-trade plan will require more energy-efficient homes (a claim we rated Pants on Fire ). The e-mail says, "The Congressional Budget Office -- supposedly non-partisan -- estimates that in just a few years the average cost to every family of four will be $6,800 per year. No one is excluded." We've spent a lot of time looking into claims about how much the cap-and-trade plan could cost families, and one thing's for certain: There's no consensus. The Environmental Protection Agency says it could cost as little as $80 per year while the conservative Heritage Foundation says it could cost as much as $1,241 annually in higher energy bills. We've explained the pros and cons of the various estimates in those previous items, so here we're going to look into the chain e-mail's claim that the CBO estimates cap-and-trade will cost a family of four $6,800 a year. The bill in question is called the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009. It is sponsored by Henry Waxman of California and Edward Markey of Massachusetts, and aims to reduce carbon emissions 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050. Companies, particularly utilities, would have to either buy pollution credits or adopt cleaner technology. Critics say that either way, the cost of energy will go up, and that cost will be passed on to the consumer. The CBO is a key player because it is a widely respected nonpartisan branch of Congress that calculates cost estimates. In June 2009, the CBO released an analysis of the House bill, saying that the economywide cost of the cap-and-trade program in 2020 would be $22 billion -- or about $175 per household. The individual cost would vary depending on your wealth. Low-income consumers could expect to save $40 a year because of credits from utilities, while high-income consumers would see a net cost for energy of $235 to $340 annually. It's also important to note that the costs are expected to vary year to year because of the way the law would be phased in. The CBO chose 2020 as a milestone for its analysis because it's a point at which the program would have been in effect for eight years, giving the economy and polluters time to adjust. But had the CBO chosen a later date, the cost per family may have been higher because the government would gradually be charging polluters more. We traced the $6,800 estimate back to a report from the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that has been very critical of the cap-and-trade plan. In the report, the group criticizes the CBO for failing to consider the harm that the cap-and-trade plan could do to the economy. The conservative group says the law could cause companies to produce less, which would reduce the GDP in 2020 by $161 billion in 2009 dollars. By 2035, it would be $650 billion lower, which works out to about $6,800 per family of four per year. So the chain e-mail has taken the estimate from a conservative think tank and falsely attributed it to the CBO, a nonpartisan branch of Congress. There are many legitimate questions that can be raised about the cost of cap-and-trade, but it's simply incorrect to say the CBO came up with the $6,800 figure. We find this claim False.

pomt-05997	"Many types of fish and shellfish from waters across the state are labeled unsafe to eat."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jan/20/james-florio/jim-florio-says-fish-new-jersey-waters-labeled-uns/	There’s plenty of fish in the waters of New Jersey, along with lots of other things: mercury, polychlorobiphenyls and dioxin, among them. And according to a former governor, there could be some danger in eating fish from Garden State waters. "Many types of fish and shellfish from waters across the state are labeled unsafe to eat," Jim Florio wrote in a Dec. 14 guest column in The Star-Ledger about how new reductions in mercury pollution will protect New Jerseyans from contaminated seafood. It turns out Florio wasn’t exactly telling a fish tale, PolitiFact New Jersey found. "I think that’s a fair and accurate statement actually," said Kerry Pflugh, manager of Constituent Services for the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. "But that doesn’t mean that everything we catch is unsafe to eat. … Advisories are not based on water quality, it’s based on what’s in the fish itself. Fish advisories are set by tissue analysis, not water quality." Jonathan Scott, communications director for Clean Water Action in Washington, DC said, "We would agree with his assessment." Florio could not be reached for comment. How are fish consumption advisories formulated? Fish collected from New Jersey waterways are sent to The Academy of Sciences of Drexel University in Philadelphia. Tissue samples are taken to test for contaminants – mostly mercury, PCBs, DDT and other pesticides, said Richard Horwitz, senior biologist at the academy. A committee decides an acceptable risk for eating a particular fish based on potential health issues for people considered "high risk": children, pregnant women and women of child-bearing age, Horwitz said. They are advised to eat smaller portions of fish and less often. The 2010 Fish Consumption Advisories for all New Jersey waterways is available at the DEP’s Office Of Science website. The 30-page document explains what parts of fish are safe to eat; proper preparation; consumption frequency; and more. "Fish is a very healthy source of protein, vitamins and minerals," said Dr. Gary Buchanan, manager for the DEP’s Office of Science. "Just be careful about the fish you eat when catching them in local waters." The state also considers federal recommendations made by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. "The EPA provides guidance to assist states, Indian tribes and local governments in developing methods of monitoring, gathering and assessing information about their fish populations," EPA press officer John Martin said in an email. "Since this information is only guidance, use by states is not mandatory. The States have primary responsibility for monitoring, assessing and making advisory decisions. Thus the basis for each State fish advisory varies." While a variety of contaminants are found in fish, mercury is the most prevalent, experts told us. The mercury found in New Jersey waters comes from air pollution emitted from power plants, coal plants and incinerators from Pennsylvania and the Midwest, according to Buchanan, Horwitz and Scott. "If those sources from out of state are reduced, that will help speed up the reduction of mercury in our waters and our fish and help allow additional fish consumption," Buchanan said. "It is a nationwide problem. It’s not just a New Jersey problem. Every state in the country has a fish advisory for some parameter and some species." Even with the chemicals found in fish, New Jerseyans shouldn’t fear eating fish caught from the state’s waters, said Tom Fote, legislative chairman for the Jersey Coast Anglers Association in Toms River, as long as fish consumption guidelines are followed. "Seafood coming out of New Jersey waters is no different than the seafood coming from out of any other state," Fote said. Our ruling Florio said in a recent opinion column in The Star-Ledger that most fish from New Jersey waterways "is labeled unsafe to eat." Experts told PolitiFact New Jersey that they agree with the former governor’s assessment but also note that fish from New Jersey waters can be eaten safely by following consumption advisories. Also, fish bought in supermarkets or other stores in New Jersey are labeled, but recreationally caught fish are not. We rate Florio’s statement Mostly True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.

pomt-04733	Says the national health care law puts federal "bureaucrats between an American citizen and her doctor."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/aug/30/chris-christie/chris-christie-says-national-health-care-law-puts-/	The truth can be difficult. So difficult that even as Gov. Chris Christie said Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney would "tell us the hard truths," Christie himself slid into misleading territory. "Mitt Romney will tell us the hard truths we need to hear to end the debacle of putting the world’s greatest health care system in the hands of federal bureaucrats and putting those bureaucrats between an American citizen and her doctor," Christie said during his keynote address Tuesday night at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Fla. In his capacity as a top Romney surrogate, Christie has previously criticized the health care reform passed by President Barack Obama, repeating the thoroughly debunked Republican talking point that the law is "a government takeover of health care." Here, we decided to check Christie’s statement that the law, formally called the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act -- or as some call it, Obamacare -- puts federal "bureaucrats between an American citizen and her doctor." (In a separate fact-check, we evaluated Christie’s claim that the United States has "the world’s greatest health care system.") PolitiFact National recently fact-checked a nearly identical statement from Romney and rated it False. Romney said that "Obamacare puts the federal government between you and your doctor." PolitiFact found Romney’s claim overstated the level of government control under the new law, which keeps intact the private-sector delivery of health care. The law requires insurance plans to carry a minimum benefits package and sets up virtual exchanges where individuals can purchase insurance. The law also creates incentives and penalties to promote better care. But none of that prevents doctors and patients from making healthcare decisions together, as they do now. And while some doctors are critical of the law, the leading physician advocacy group, the American Medical Association, supports the reform. The group’s president, Jeremy Lazarus, said in a June 28 news release after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act that the law "simplifies administrative burdens, including streamlining insurance claims, so physicians and their staff can spend more time with patients and less time on paperwork." Other physician advocacy groups have also expressed support for the law. But, as PolitiFact noted, there are concerns among specialists about the legislation’s impact, specifically in relation to the Medicare program. Many opponents of the law have said the 15-member Independent Payment Advisory Board or IPAB -- which will recommend ways to prevent Medicare’s spending growth from exceeding certain targets -- will lead to health care rationing. But the board is specifically forbidden from submitting "any recommendation to ration health care." Though it can decrease government payments to health care providers for services and recommend ways to cut wasteful spending. In a March fact-check, U.S. Senate hopeful Joe Kyrillos, whom Christie has endorsed, pointed, in part, to IPAB to support his claim that under the health care law "the patient-doctor relationship will be eliminated." That statement rated a Pants on Fire on the Truth-O-Meter. Our ruling Christie said Romney will be able to tell the hard truths necessary to end the debacle of putting federal "bureaucrats between an American citizen and her doctor." We found no solid evidence to support Christie’s sweeping claim, which overreaches on the role of the federal government under the new law. With the reform, the private health care delivery system remains in place. While there are significant changes to the health insurance market and incentives and penalties to promote better care, that doesn’t mean the government is inserting itself in between doctors and patients. We rate this statement False.

pomt-04073	Says Rick Scott’s proposal for election reform "only mandates 48 hours of early voting."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2013/jan/22/pink-slip-rick/pink-slip-rick-rick-scotts-proposal-only-mandates-/	Activists behind Pink Slip Rick are not impressed with Gov. Rick Scott’s attempts to distance himself from the voting reforms he signed into law in 2011. Scott called on the Florida Legislature to consider three reforms to avoid hours-long waits that dogged early voting in some counties in 2012: add more sites for early voting aside from election offices, libraries and city halls; shorten the language of proposed constitutional amendments; and increase the maximum number of early voting days from eight to 14. Scott touted his proposal as giving Floridians "the greatest access to early voting ever in Florida history – at up to 168 hours." But @PinkSlipRick tweeted a strikingly different take on the announcement. "#PinkSlipRick’s proposal is so vague that it only mandates 48 hours of early voting," the tweet said. We wondered how Pink Slip Rick, which is organized by liberal group Florida Watch Action, could have a tally so much lower from the governor’s statement. Here’s the answer: Both sides are right. The 2011 elections law reduced the number of days for early voting from 14 to eight, with supervisors required to offer between six and 12 hours of early voting each day instead of simply eight hours. (Here’s a related check on that.) That meant local elections supervisors had the choice to offer between 48 hours and 96 hours of early voting over eight days. Still, most supervisors offered the maximum of 96 hours, according to an analysis by University of Florida political science professor Daniel Smith. At 54 hours, Hernando County was among counties offering the smallest amount of time to vote early. Scott is recommending a law that allows supervisors to offer between eight and 14 days of early voting and maintaining the six-to-12 hour window. So under Scott’s proposal, supervisors would be able to provide a maximum of 168 hours of early voting (14 days multiplied by 12 hours a day). The fewest number of hours they would be required to offer for is 48 (eight days multiplied by six hours). Scott’s proposal largely mirrors recommendations from the state supervisors of elections association. "Our ultimate goal must be to restore Floridians' confidence in our election system," Scott said in a statement. "We need more early voting days, which should include an option of the Sunday before Election Day." So both sides make an accurate remark about Scott’s plan, but they cherry-pick the extreme scenario to fit their interest. Florida Watch Action executive director Amy Ritter said Scott should have restored early voting the way it was before the 2011 election law, with a minimum of 96 hours. "Anything less than that is not a promise to restore or expand early voting," Ritter said. We surveyed several local supervisors for how they might implement Scott’s option. In Miami-Dade County, a spokeswoman said the county would likely resume the pre-2011 law system of offering 14 days with 8 hours each day and eight total hours on the weekend, with more room to offer more hours closer to a presidential election. In Hillsborough County, supervisor Craig Latimer said the county has always offered the maximum amount of hours for early voting, and he could see offering the hypothetical max of 168 hours in a presidential election. "There’s got to be relief for large counties," he said. In tiny Franklin County, home to just over 7,000 Panhandle voters, elections supervisor Ida C. Elliott said implementing the full monty of 168 hours would not be feasible, citing overtime costs for workers and a simple lack of need. But even she wouldn’t go to the minimum of 48 hours. "48? That’s a little too...not enough," she said. "That’s crazy. You’d have to do at least your whole working day, for sure." Our ruling Pink Slip Rick’s remark is accurate but leaves out part of the story. Scott’s proposal would mandate a minimum of 48 hours, but it would also let supervisors offer a maximum of 168 hours. Local supervisors would make the call, and the ones we spoke with said they would offer more than the bare minimum. Still, the group is right that 48 hours would be the mandated minimum. The statement is accurate but needs clarification. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Pink Slip Rick	None	None	None	2013-01-22T17:56:05	2013-01-17	['None']
pomt-13423	"Since 1978, California has spent $5 billion to put 13 people to death."	mostly false	/california/statements/2016/sep/21/tom-steyer/did-california-spend-5-billion-execute-13-people/	California billionaire and potential gubernatorial candidate Tom Steyer joined the debate over ending the state’s death penalty last week by repeating a questionable claim. "Since 1978, California has spent $5 billion to put 13 people to death," Steyer said in a press release announcing his support for Proposition 62. The measure would abolish capital punishment in the state. Proposition 66, a competing measure on November’s ballot, would keep the death penalty but proposes speeding up its appeals process. There’s no doubt California’s death penalty system is slow and expensive: But $5 billion to execute 13 people? We decided to fact-check that suspect claim. Our research There are more than 700 people on California’s death row, which the Yes on 62 campaign has correctly claimed is the largest death row in the Western Hemisphere. The state has paid incarceration and court costs for all of those inmates, not just the few that have been executed since California reinstated the death penalty in 1978. Steyer based his ‘$5 billion to execute 13 people’ claim on information from the Yes on 62 campaign, according to his spokesman. The campaign has made the death penalty’s high cost a central part of its argument for abolishing executions. The Yes campaign made the same claim as Steyer in a September 12 Facebook post. The Yes on 62 campaign posted this image on its Facebook page on Sept. 12, 2016. The Yes on 62 campaign made the same claim on Twitter on Sept. 16, 2016. It published a more accurate and nuanced statement on its website: "Since 1978, California taxpayers have paid $5 billion to maintain the death penalty and death row, and executed 13 people." The Yes on 62 campaign says it extrapolated the $5 billion estimate from a report by California’s Loyola Law School in 2011 that placed the cost of the state’s entire death penalty system at $4 billion. One of the report’s authors, Paula Mitchell, told PolitiFact California that the $5 billion figure is her updated estimate for how much state and federal taxpayers have spent on California’s entire death penalty system since 1978, not just on cases for the 13 people who have been executed. Mitchell said Steyer and the Yes on 62 campaign left out this key context in their claims. "I think the way to fairly characterize the expense is to say we’ve spent $5 billion on a system that has produced only 13 executions since 1978," said Mitchell, who heads Loyola’s Project for the Innocent and is an adjunct professor. Representatives for the No on 62 campaign rejected the claim by Steyer, noting costs are spread across "a much larger number of cases." They also called the $5 billion estimate in Mitchell’s report "a wildly inflated number." A guard stands watch over the east block of death row at San Quentin State Prison Tuesday, Aug. 16, 2016, in San Quentin, Calif. A pair of November ballot measures will decide the future of the death penalty in California. As of Aug. 1, 2016, there were 700 condemned inmates at the prison. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg) Wildly inflated? We dug a bit deeper to examine whether Steyer not only wrongly attributed the entire cost of the death penalty system to 13 cases, but also used a "wildly inflated" cost estimate. Mitchell, who is an advocate for abolishing capital punishment, said she’s worked with the Yes on 62 campaign to discuss death penalty cost estimates. She said her estimates are derived from the cost of pre-trial investigations, trials, appeals and incarceration. Her report cites figures from the California Commission on the Fair Administration of Justice, among other sources. Frank Zimring, a law professor and death penalty expert at UC Berkeley, said he’s relied on the report in the past and finds the cost estimate credible, "give or take a hundred million or so." Cost comparison Mitchell’s said her current $5 billion cost estimate represents the amount taxpayers spent "above what it would have cost us" without the death penalty. Her report could not reach a conclusion, she said, on how much a life in prison system would have cost taxpayers over the same period. On average, it cost $47,000 per year to incarcerate a prison inmate in California during the 2008-2009 fiscal year, according to the Legislative Analyst’s Office. The cost to house a death row inmate, however, is $90,000 more per year than for an inmate in the general prison population, said Mitchell. She attributed the higher cost to lengthy and complex death row court cases. Death penalty court cases cost more than others, in part, because more attorneys are legally required to participate and more investigation is required. Costs also mount because death penalty appeals must be heard by the California Supreme Court, which has only seven justices. That creates a bottleneck, Mitchell said, where each case can stretch a decade or more. Without the death penalty, Zimring said the cost of trials and appeals would be "vastly less." Our ruling Tom Steyer said recently: "Since 1978, California has spent $5 billion to put 13 people to death." But that cost has been spread over hundreds of cases since 1978, not just the 13 that led to executions. California currently has more than 700 inmates on death row. Prosecuting and housing each costs the state significantly year after year. Steyer’s claim might have been correct if he had said taxpayers have spent $5 billion on a system that’s resulted in 13 executions. Instead, his words leave the impression California paid the entire $5 billion for a fraction of its hundreds of cases. We rate Steyer's claim Mostly False.

"Alabama State Police arrest 3 poll workers in Birmingham" stated a headline on the American Revolution website. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. There is no truth to this article. We saw no disclaimer on the American Revolution website, but the same story was posted on reaganwasright, a website that identifies itself as satire and is a frequent purveyor of fake news. Jones beat Moore in the Alabama U.S. Senate special election Dec. 12. The Washington Post reported in November that Moore, while in his 30s, initiated sexual encounters with several teenagers, according to the women interviewed by the newspaper. There have been multiple fake news reports related to the election. This article on the American Revolution website contained no details explaining the supposedly fraudulent votes and contains some fictional details such as stating that Birmingham is in Applevale County -- it is located in Jefferson County. It stated that the three poll workers -- Wanda Werkmeister, Olivia Pertuiary and Maureen Brown -- will all face felony charges punishable by up to 10 years in prison and $1 million in fines. The article includes a quote by Fox News host Sean Hannity, but we found no evidence he said this: "Without that inner-city ghetto vote, Doug Jones doesn’t have a chance. It doesn’t make much sense why someone from the city’s vote is so much more important to Democrats, who swear they aren’t at all racist." The article stated that Hannity made those comments on Dana Loesch’s show Guns God and Grits. A Fox News spokeswoman told PolitiFact that Hannity did not make the statement and Loesch, who hosts a conservative radio show, told PolitiFact that she hadn’t had Hannity on her show in a few years and doesn’t have a show with that name. The American Revolution website linked to the Facebook page for Special News USA. We sent a message to Special News USA via Facebook and a person replied stating, "I do not know whether or not the news is correct or not, but I distributed it to get the feedback of other people." We found no news reports that poll workers were arrested in Birmingham. Robyn Bradley Bryan, Alabama Law Enforcement Agency spokeswoman, told PolitiFact that the agency did not arrest any poll workers. A spokesman for the Alabama Secretary of State, John Bennett, told PolitiFact that there were no poll workers with the names in the article.

pomt-00970	On counting state budget shortfalls	full flop	/wisconsin/statements/2015/feb/13/scott-walker/did-scott-walker-flip-flip-budget-shortfall/	It’s a favorite talking point of Gov. Scott Walker, one he’s taking national as he charges up a potential presidential campaign: He inherited a $3.6 billion budget shortfall from Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, but dug out of it by cutting costs and limiting union bargaining power with state and local government. Walker even dropped the figure into his well-received January 2015 speech at an Iowa cattle call for 2016 Republican presidential hopefuls. So our eyebrows went up Feb. 6, 2015 when Walker was questioned about his stewardship of the state budget by Fox News anchor Bret Baier in a profile on the rising presidential hopes of the Wisconsin governor. During the interview, Baier said: "You talk about $2 billion in (tax) savings for individuals and businesses, but you also have a $2.2 billion budget shortfall in the coming two years." Walker immediately questioned the credibility of the $2.2 billion number and portrayed it as a media creation. "I would contend that’s based on numbers from some of the Wisconsin media outlets as if everybody who asked for anything got it," Walker said. "Even in your own household budget that never happens." Has Walker changed his view on the validity of these shortfall estimates now that he’s in the governor’s chair? This is another one for the Flip-O-Meter. Our standard disclaimer applies: The Flip-O-Meter is not designed to say whether any change in position is good policy or good politics. Rather, it strictly looks at whether a public official has been consistent in his or her stated views on a topic. Let’s go back to November 2010, shortly after his election to replace Doyle. Walker pounced on the numbers from a statutorily required report by the state Department of Administration that showed -- in combination with other debts -- Walker would inherit a $3.6 billion shortfall six months after taking office in January 2011. Time and again …. and again … Walker used that number to portray the state as broke, and to explain the cuts he proposed -- and which were ultimately made -- in public education funding and other programs. We, and other media outlets, examined the figure then and declared it credible, as far as it goes. As we’ve explained, it’s not a "deficit" number as Walker and others in Madison often call it. It’s a pre-budget estimate designed to illustrate the size of the shortfall or challenge the governor faces when putting together a budget. The shortfall figure includes all the requests from state departments, and also predictions of how much tax revenue the state will collect. Fast forward to the Fox interview. Walker said the report of a $2.2 billion shortfall heading into his budget was a media creation. But the fact is, it came from a report from his own budget shop in his Department of Administration. What’s more, tax cuts pushed by Walker and Republicans in the Legislature play into some of the challenge that faced budget-makers, as projected revenues have fallen short. But by far the biggest chunk of the $2.2 billion projection is -- as Walker alluded to on Fox -- the spending increases sought by state agencies. But that’s always been the case. That’s the purpose of the report -- to see how tax revenue projections are looking compared to what state agencies say they want and need. Nothing’s changed about the methodology behind the shortfall projections. The only thing that’s changed is Walker’s tune. He still talks up the 2010 figures as if describing a budget-balancing miracle, but now dismisses their 2014 version as a big nothing. This merits a Full Flop. ------ More on Scott Walker For profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Scott Walker page.

pomt-02914	"Only 14 percent of Americans were able to keep these individual market plans for two years" before Obamacare became law.	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/03/van-jones/amid-swarm-canceled-policies-van-jones-says-indivi/	Opponents of President Barack Obama’s health care law are quick to evoke the plight of potentially millions of Americans getting hit by cancellation notices from their health insurance companies due to new coverage requirements under the Affordable Care Act. All of a sudden, Republican critics sound like members of the consumer-first "party of Ralph Nader," quipped Van Jones, the Democratic co-host of CNN’s Crossfire, during a panel discussion on ABC’s This Week. "They're the biggest consumer protection operation in the world now, but six months ago we had people who were getting these same cancellation notices and the Republican Party was silent," he said. "There's a problem when you're indifferent to the losers the last time. I want to make one thing perfectly clear. You look at the numbers here. Fourteen percent, only 14 percent of Americans were able to keep these individual market plans for two years before." Is his figure about the volatile individual market accurate? First, understand that consumers who seek health insurance coverage on their own are not the norm in this country. Most people are covered by their employer or Medicaid or Medicare. Another 16 percent are uninsured. About 6 percent, or 15 million Americans, are in the individual marketplace, which will be the most affected by the new law. That was intentional. After the show, Jones told PunditFact that the individual marketplace is a "wild, wild west" where people were denied coverage for pre-existing conditions and policyholders were continually dropped by insurers offering thin, sketchy coverage. The people in this unstable market are a transient bunch, signing 12-month contracts with insurers as they move between jobs or lose coverage they once had. When their contract is up, the insurer can discontinue a policy or change it. If they end it, federal law says they have to give policyholders 90 days notice and the choice to sign up for different coverage. "Current policyholders are not having their current policy canceled – rather, the insurance company is exercising its option to discontinue the policy at the end of the contract year," according to Georgetown University’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms. And now, if healthcare.gov straightens out, they can purchase new coverage there. The health care law’s authors wanted to make sure people in the individual marketplace had access to the same standardized coverage as everyone else. As a result, new policies created after the health care law passed in March 2010 must cover "10 essential health benefits," such as preventive care, ambulatory service, and maternity and newborn care. Because many of these individual plans don’t offer that, and they weren’t eligible to be "grandfathered" under the new law, the insurers are shedding some of them. It’s a lot to take in, but it’s all part of the complicated before-and-after picture that Jones was trying to paint for viewers about the benefits of the much-maligned health care law. As for his stat that "only 14 percent of Americans were able to keep these individual market plans for two years" before the health care law, Jones told us he was a little off. He meant to say 17 percent, a reference to a finding in a 2004 study published in the journal Health Affairs that was recently highlighted in a Washington Post explainer about the policy cancellations. The study examined coverage patterns in the individual insurance marketplace from 1996-2000 -- quite some time ago. The key finding for our purposes is this: "Roughly one-sixth (17 percent) of those with individual insurance coverage retained it for more than two years." The reason? Not because of insurers canceling plans like Jones suggested. Though insurers do cancel coverage, the study determined that most of the volatility with enrollment and dropped policies had to do with policyholders moving between employer coverage, with a median enrollment length of eight months. The people who kept their insurance the longest were small business employees or self-employed, the study found. So Jones is close on the number. But Timothy Jost, a Washington and Lee law professor, says the number does not exactly mean what Jones said it does. Jones is saying it’s the fault of insurance companies that most people could not hold onto their coverage, but the reality is less known. It’s probably not accurate to pin it all on insurers canceling the plans, Jost said, though no one knows for sure how much of the churning has to do with insurers and people canceling their plan or choosing a new one. "He does have a point, but I wouldn’t have said it that way," Jost said. "It’s a market that has just not functioned very well. ... It’s long been the case that people just come and go from the market all the time." Other health policy experts found Jones’ remarks confusing. Yes, the market tends to be volatile due to high administrative costs and the inability to pool risk among healthy and sick patients like large employer plans, said Gail Wilensky, who ran Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. "Does he think Republicans should have complained about the volatility in the individual market before this? That only makes sense if they have a solution to the problem," she said. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius referenced another 2004 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation in an online column meant to offer some calm around the cancellation notices for individual plans. The study said about 45 percent of policies remained after two years, a much higher estimate though its sample did not include short-term health insurance policies that are often bought to cover gaps of three to six months. Our ruling Jones said, "Only 14 percent of Americans were able to keep these individual market plans for two years" before Obamacare became law. He was trying to make the point that canceled policies have been the norm in the individual insurance market long before the Affordable Care Act. His figure is 3 percentage points off of a 2004 study that found only 17 percent of individual policyholders kept their plans for more than two years. More importantly, though, a health policy expert said Jones probably went too far in indicating that insurance companies were to blame for the high turnover. Many people enter that market for the purpose of buying short-term protection. That means people in the individual market might be dropping the health insurance plan they have as much as insurance companies might be canceling the plan altogether. We rate the statement Half True.	None	Van Jones	None	None	None	2013-11-03T17:58:28	2013-11-03	['United_States']
pomt-00430	"NASA says an asteroid bigger than a football pitch is heading towards Earth."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2018/aug/24/blog-posting/not-so-close-asteroid-headed-towards-earth-wont-hi/	Articles trending on social media are hinting at an out-of-this-world claim: that Earth is about to be decimated by an incoming asteroid. "NASA says an asteroid bigger than a football pitch is heading towards Earth," the Wakefield Express reported. The meaning of that sentence — aside from the term "football pitch," which is simply Britspeak for "soccer field" — seemed alarming to us. "Dubbed ‘2016 NF23’, the gargantuan lump of space rock has been labelled ‘potentially hazardous’ by (NASA)," the article continued. Uh-oh. We began to wonder if Earth was on a collision course with a giant asteroid. Turns out, the answer is no. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Close, but not that close The Center for Near Earth Object Studies at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory keeps a database that details all instances where objects in space have had a "close approach" to the Earth. The asteroid in question, 2016 NF23, is on that list. According to that database, the asteroid is predicted to be closest to the Earth on Aug. 29, 2018. It will be travelling at 20,000 miles per hour, or about 5 and a half miles per second. The database also says the asteroid is estimated to be 70 meters to 160 meters in diameter, or about 75 to 175 yards. That’s roughly the size of a soccer field. But there’s actually no reason to worry about 2016 NF23. That’s because even at its point of closest approach to the Earth, the asteroid will be more than 3 million miles away (or, a lot of soccer fields). That’s more than 13 times the distance between the Earth and its moon. "From an astronomical perspective, that may be close, but from a human perspective, it’s obviously not very close at all; the asteroid is certainly not ‘skimming’ past the Earth, as the story claims," said Paul Chados, the manager of the Center for Near Earth Object Studies, in an interview. He added, "In no way is our prediction a ‘warning,' as the story intimates." The Wakefield Express is also incorrect in saying that 2016 NF3 "has been labelled 'potentially hazardous'" by NASA. Alan Chamberlin, a senior engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, told PolitiFact, "The object is not classified as a PHA (Potentially Hazardous Asteroid) as defined in our CNEOS website." That’s because the asteroid has too high of an absolute magnitude (a measurement for determining how bright asteroids appear) and is too small of an object to be considered a Potentially Hazardous Asteroid. Both Chados and Chamberlin suggested that the article was misleading and recommended that readers who are concerned about asteroids and other objects possibly striking the Earth look at NASA’s Sentry page. Unlike the close approach database, the Sentry page only lists asteroids "that have even the slightest chance of colliding with our planet over the next century or two," as Chados put it. The Wakefield Express did not respond to a request for comment sent to the editorial email listed on its Contact Us page. Our ruling A headline on the website Wakefield Express claimed that "NASA says an asteroid bigger than a football pitch is heading towards Earth." NASA has indeed confirmed a large asteroid is heading in the direction of Earth. But the asteroid will not actually do any damage to us. It will stay far, far, far away. In addition, the article says that NASA has labeled the asteroid ‘potentially hazardous.’ NASA has made no such designation. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-14186	"As a former federal prosecutor, I prosecuted over 4,000 cases."	true	/missouri/statements/2016/apr/25/catherine-hanaway/federal-prosecutor-catherine-hanaway-and-her-offic/	At the March 17 Republican gubernatorial debate in Columbia, candidate Catherine Hanaway told an audience that she prosecuted more than 4,000 cases during her tenure as the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri. Hanaway served as a federal prosecutor from July 20, 2005, through April 17, 2009, which means that she would have had to prosecute at least three cases a day on average to make that 4,000-case benchmark. That seemed like a lot of cases, so we looked at the record. Hanaway’s history in public life While many Missourians may know Hanaway as the first female speaker of the House in Missouri, she is also a decorated prosecutor who’s worked in both the private and public sectors. In 2005, Hanaway left her position as speaker after being appointed U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri by former President George W. Bush. In 2009, Hanaway resigned and joined the Ashcroft Law Firm, founded by former Missouri governor, senator and U.S. attorney general John Ashcroft. As a side note, in 2013, Missouri Lawyer’s Media listed Hanaway as the most expensive lawyer to hire in Missouri at a rate of upward to $793 an hour. Hanaway said at the time that most of the firm’s clients were large national and international companies, and "our rates are reflective of that." Hanaway joined Husch Blackwell’s St. Louis office in 2013. Her federal prosecution history Will Scharf, Hanaway’s policy director, said as a U.S. attorney, Hanaway was "directly responsible for federal prosecutions across half the state, signing every federal indictment initiating formal proceedings against criminals within the district, and supervising prosecutions as they progressed." It’s unclear how many of these cases she prosecuted personally. She oversaw a staff of more than 100 people, as Hanaway makes clear on her campaign website. According to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri’s online Case Management/Electronic Case Files system, which tracks criminal case filings for the court, Hanaway’s office filed at least 5,430 cases during her stint as a federal prosecutor. That doesn’t include cases inherited by Hanaway from her predecessors. So it could be argued that Hanaway actually dealt with even more than 5,430 cases. Scharf also noted in an email interview that Hanaway never claimed to be "lead counsel" or that she "tried 4,000 cases," and that the notion that she could physically be there to prosecute 4,000 cases "would be absurd, since 95 percent of criminal cases end in a guilty plea without a trial." That percentage of plea bargains is in line with a 2011 Bureau of Justice Statistics estimate. Our ruling Hanaway told an audience that she prosecuted over 4,000 cases during her time as the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri. Based on federal data, Hanaway’s office dealt with well over 4,000 cases and each case required her personal signature. Her words might suggest that she handled each case herself, but most listeners would understand that she ran a large office. We rate this statement True.

pomt-00508	"Under the Affordable Care Act, anyone on Medicare who is admitted to a hospital for observation will be responsible for the bill. Medicare won't pay a cent."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/25/chain-email/chain-email-says-medicare-wont-pay-observational-s/	A reader recently sent us a chain email we hadn’t seen before. The lengthy missive, purportedly written by a "senior gentleman in Mesa, Arizona," details a visit to a hospital made contentious by Medicare payment rules. The anonymous author claims to have experienced "a medical situation that made it very clear that the ‘Affordable Care Act’ is neither affordable, nor do they care." The full email, which is lengthy, is accessible in its entirety here. But briefly, the author relates what happened after he sought treatment for a suspected urinary-tract infection. After collapsing in a local urgent-care clinic, he was taken to a hospital. There, the medical staff feared he could be experiencing sepsis, a potentially serious inflammation caused by an infection, so they ordered a battery of tests, including one that could take a day or two to complete. As a result, they told him that he would need to stay in the hospital "for observation" rather than going home. Here’s what happened next: "I said, ‘Doctor, correct me if I'm wrong, but if you admit me for observation, my Medicare will not pay anything. This is due to the Affordable Care Act.’ He said, ‘That's right, it won't.’ I then grabbed for my bag of clothing and said, ‘Then I'm going home.’ He said you're really too sick to be going home, but I understand your position. This health program is going to hit seniors especially hard." Then another doctor came into the room. "I said, ‘Doc, you and I both know that under the Affordable Care Act anyone on Medicare who is admitted to a hospital for observation will be responsible for the bill. Medicare won't pay a cent.’ At which point he nodded in affirmation. I said, ‘You will either admit me for a specific treatment or you won't admit me.’ Realizing he wasn't going to win this one, he said he would prepare my release papers." We zeroed in on the core claim of this story, that "under the Affordable Care Act, anyone on Medicare who is admitted to a hospital for observation will be responsible for the bill. Medicare won't pay a cent." When we looked into it, we found that Medicare does indeed have different reimbursement policies for patients who had been admitted to hospitals for observation as opposed to being admitted to treat a specific diagnosis. However, the email’s author (and, if his recounting is accurate, each of the medical professionals he spoke to) were sorely misinformed about how Medicare rules operate. The different reimbursement rates have to do with follow-up in-home care, not the original hospital stay. And crucially, the controversy over reimbursement for patients under "observation care" has nothing whatsoever to do with President Barack Obama’s health care law, the Affordable Care Act. What is ‘observation care’? According to Kaiser Health News, "hospitals provide observation care for patients who are not well enough to go home but not sick enough to be admitted. This care requires a doctor’s order and is considered an outpatient service, even though patients may stay as long as several days. The hospitalization can include short-term treatment and tests to help doctors decide whether the patient should be admitted." Because observation care is considered outpatient treatment, Medicare generally covers such visits, minus things like copayments and the cost of routine drugs. Where Medicare reimbursement significantly falls short is once an observation patient leaves the hospital. "Observation patients cannot receive Medicare coverage for follow-up care in a nursing home, even though their doctors recommend it," according to Kaiser. "To be eligible for nursing home coverage, seniors must have first spent at least three consecutive days (or through three midnights) as an admitted patient, not counting the day of discharge." In other words, assuming the email author’s story actually happened, he shouldn’t have had to worry about Medicare paying for his time in the hospital while under observation. Medicare would have paid, minus copayments and the like; there was no need for him to go home while in a fragile state just to avoid being responsible for the full cost of his care. Is this related to the Affordable Care Act? Tying this policy to Obama’s law is flat-out wrong. "The Affordable Care Act has nothing to do with observation status," said Mary T. (Terry) Berthelot, a senior attorney with the Center for Medicare Advocacy. Several other health-policy experts confirmed that. The policy was established by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a division of the Department of Health and Human Services. While we’re at it, we’ll take a moment to debunk an additional Affordable Care Act-related claim included in the email. The author writes that during a visit to his family practitioner, "I told him that I had heard that the Affordable Care Act would no longer pay for cancer treatment for those 76 and older, is that true? His understanding is that it is true." In reality, there are no such age limits. In October 2014, we rated Pants on Fire a chain email that claimed that under the Affordable Care Act, "at age 76 when you most need it most, you are not eligible for cancer treatment. … Cancer hospital will ration care according to the patient's age." Our ruling The chain email said that "under the Affordable Care Act, anyone on Medicare who is admitted to a hospital for observation will be responsible for the bill. Medicare won't pay a cent." That’s wrong. Medicare will cover the hospital stay, minus standard copayments and the like. Patients kept in the hospital under observation will not be able to receive Medicare reimbursements for follow-up care such as nursing-home stays, however. Even more inaccurate is the charge that this policy stemmed from the Affordable Care Act. In reality, this stems from a separate policy decision and had nothing to do with Obama’s law. The claim is not only ridiculous but also dangerous, by urging ailing patients to leave the hospital for no good reason. This claim rates Pants on Fire.

pomt-01547	Says "Nick Rahall voted with Obama 94 percent of the time."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/15/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-says-nick-rahall-voted-barack-obama-94-time/	One of the biggest obstacles to a strong Democratic showing in the 2014 midterm elections is that approval ratings for President Barack Obama are mired in the 40 percent range -- and even lower in many red states. Because of this, it’s no surprise that the National Republican Congressional Committee -- the House Republicans’ campaign arm -- is creating ads that emphasize the degree to which vulnerable Democratic incumbents have voted with Obama. We recently found two NRCC ads using virtually identical language on this point. Here, we’ll fact-check an ad that targets Democratic Rep. Nick Rahall of West Virginia. In a separate item, we’ll fact-check an ad attacking Democratic Rep. John Barrow of Georgia. Rahall, first elected in 1976, represents a district that gave Republican Mitt Romney a whopping 32-point margin of victory over Obama in the 2012 presidential election. It ranks as the second-most Republican district currently represented by a Democrat in the House, making it a prime takeover opportunity for the GOP. (The most Republican district held by a Democrat is the Utah seat occupied by retiring Rep. Jim Matheson.) Rahall faces state Sen. Evan Jenkins in November, in a race analysts say is one of the most vulnerable seats held by the Democrats. The ad against Rahall features a constituent, Carrie Overby of Huntington, W.Va. She says, "On the issues that have mattered, Nick Rahall has voted with Barack Obama, whether it's spending, cap-and-trade, EPA regulations, Obamacare." When she says that, text on the screen says, "Nick Rahall voted with Obama 94 percent of the time." In much smaller type, the ad footnotes this claim to "Congressional Quarterly 2009 vote analysis." Since data from 2009 would now be five years old, we had a hunch that the NRCC might have ignored a couple of years with lower percentages. It turns out we were right. Data from the same CQ study shows that Rahall voted with Obama 88 percent of the time in 2010, 65 percent in 2011, 64 percent in 2012 and 58 percent in 2013. (Data for 2014 has not yet been posted.) That’s not as low as Barrow, who was targeted in the companion ad; Barrow’s score dropped as low as 28 percent in 2012. Still, it shows a degree of voting independence by Rahall that’s not reflected in the NRCC ad. Clearly, the 94 percent figure for voting with Obama was a more attractive one for the NRCC to highlight, but it amounts to cherry-picking. Asked to justify using the five-year-old data and ignoring later figures, NRCC spokesman Ian Prior said, "It is important for West Virginia voters to know that in 2009, when the Democrats controlled all the levers of government and could push legislation through both chambers of Congress, Nick Rahall voted with Barack Obama 94 percent of the time, including on Obama’s budget, which included a cap-and-trade plan and a $3 billion, 37 percent EPA funding increase to advance his climate agenda." Our ruling The NRCC ad said, "Nick Rahall voted with Obama 94 percent of the time." Rahall did indeed vote with Obama 94 percent of the time -- but that was in 2009, a fact that is footnoted in the ad, albeit in small type. Between 2010 and 2013, Rahall’s voting record was less closely aligned with Obama, bottoming out at 58 percent in 2013, the most recent year for which data is available. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, so we rate it Half True.

pomt-02378	Says President Barack Obama’s approval rating "gained 3 points in the last couple months."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/mar/16/dan-pfeiffer/dan-pfeiffer-says-obamas-approval-rating-recent-mo/	Here’s a smattering of headlines from the last week on President Barack Obama’s polling numbers: Time: "Poll: Obama’s Approval Rating Sinks To New Low." Politico: "Poll: Obama approval at record low." Wall Street Journal: "WSJ/NBC News Poll: Obama's Approval Rating Hits New Low." Des Moines Register: "Obama job approval hits record low." So you can imagine our surprise when White House adviser Dan Pfeiffer claimed Obama’s numbers are actually up during an interview with Meet the Press host David Gregory. Here’s the exchange. Gregory: "We had a big poll out, Wall Street Journal/NBC News, this week. Here’s what it found. Overall job approval for the president: 41 percent. Handling the economy: 41 percent. Same number when it came to foreign policy. And here’s what’s striking: Approval is 74 percent among Democrats. Sounds high, but it’s the lowest that the president’s had. ... The president has really slipped." Pfeiffer: "Public polls are a little bit all over the map. On the same day your poll came out, another poll came out that showed the president gaining 6 points in the last couple months. I’ve looked at a lot of data and let me tell you what we see. There’s no question that everyone in Washington, the president included, took a big hit from the double whammy of a shutdown and the problems of healthcare.gov. We have stabilized and we’re working our way back. If you look at the aggregate of public polling, we’ve gained 3 points in the last couple months." We checked in with the White House to see where Pfeiffer got his numbers. A spokesman pointed us to Real Clear Politics, a political website that aggregates polling data and calculates an average. Obama’s job approval has been underwater for some time. Since May of last year, more Americans polled expressed disapproval in Obama’s job performance than approval. The gap has widened considerably since then. While the Wall Street Journal/NBC poll released this week has Obama hitting a new low with an approval rating of 41 percent, the White House noted the Real Clear Politics average had Obama bottom out in December with an approval rating of 39.8 percent. That came on Dec. 3 after several weeks of bad headlines about healthcare.gov’s botched rollout. On March 17, Obama’s aggregate poll numbers put his approval rating at 42.9 percent. That accounts for the 3-point jump that Pfeiffer claimed. The recent "surge" in the average seems to be skewed largely by two outlier polls conducted by Rasmussen Reports and Bloomberg. In a survey from March 13-15, Rasmussen Reports said 49 percent of Americans approve of Obama, while 50 percent disapprove, a statistical dead heat. Bloomberg between March 7-10 found an even split among those surveyed -- 48 percent both approved and disapproved of Obama. That’s a six-point improvement from December, when Bloomberg put his approval rating at 42 percent. The remainder of the polls included in the Real Clear Politics average showed Obama’s net approval rating ranging from -8 (Public Policy Polling) to -16 (Fox News) percentage points. John McIntyre with Real Clear Politics said the average from Dec. 3 likely included six or more polls taken between mid to late November as well as daily tracking polls, but it's possible they weren't from the same pollsters as the current average (at press time McIntyre was looking into which polls were used and we'll update the post when he gets back to us). He added that a quick look at the numbers showed, based on Real Clear Politics' average, Pfeiffer was right, though he noted that the December average captured a weird time period as some polls shut down around the Thanksgiving holiday. Other poll aggregation methods, meanwhile, show much more modest gains by the president. Huffington Post, for example, tracks 88 polls and takes a snapshot of the daily tracking polls from Gallup and Rasmussen every three days. According to their model, Obama’s aggregate approval rating was 42.5 percent on Dec. 2 (his low point) and has jumped just a bit to 43.3 percent. That’s less than 1 percentage point, a considerably smaller improvement than Real Clear Politics’ average. Charles Franklin, co-founder of pollster.com (which the Huffington Post now owns) and director of the Marquette Law School Poll in Milwaukee, walked us through his own aggregation of Obama’s poll numbers. According to Franklin, Obama’s low point came Dec. 2 when he registered an approval rating of 41.98 percent. He currently estimates the number at 44.38, a gain of about 2.4 percentage points. So all three poll averages show Obama’s low point actually came in early December, but his bounceback varies depending on the methodology. "There are various ways of ‘averaging’ or aggregating polls to estimate trends," Franklin said. "My bottom line: There has been some gain though it appears to be not as large as 3 points when using all available polls and a standard trend estimate. There may be a specific pollster you could find that has shown a 3 point gain, but that is cherry picking the one with a larger gain, rather than using all the polls as I and HuffPost do." Our ruling When asked about Obama’s approval rating, Pfeiffer said, "We’ve gained 3 points in the last couple months." He’s right that the aggregate of polling data suggests that Obama’s low point was December, not early March, as the new WSJ/NBC poll said. But there’s some variation in how big of a rebound Obama’s approval rating has seen. While Real Clear Politics says its 3 percent (buoyed by two outliers), Huffington Post put it at less than a percentage point. Franklin said it was somewhere in between those two.

pomt-03711	"Gov. Scott Walker (is) more than halfway to (his) 250,000 jobs goal."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2013/apr/17/maciver-institute/maciver-institute-says-wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-/	Gov. Scott Walker promised to create 250,000 private sector jobs by the end of his four-year term. With less than two years remaining, the governor’s opponents -- and supporters -- are paying increased attention to the count. That’s why an item posted April 9, 2013 by the MacIver Institute caught our attention. The Madison-based group, which publishes items supportive of conservative causes -- items that are often then cited by other conservatives -- included this headline: "Gov. Scott Walker more than halfway to 250,000 jobs goal." That’s a much larger number of jobs created under Walker than we’ve ever heard -- even from the governor himself. In December 2012, Walker said the state had created "just under 100,000 jobs" since he took office. We rated that statement Pants on Fire. Why? Walker had combined full and partial year data sets from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages compiled by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. His staff explained that he was using a "raw number." But state experts and the governor’s own staff have long said that while the quarterly census is more accurate than monthly measures, the census data should only be viewed in one-year blocks. That is, January to January, or July to July. In other words, you can’t combine partial years of census data with full years to create a running total, due to major seasonal fluctuations in the workforce. Here is what Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie told us when we asked about job numbers in the summer of 2012: "Please don’t, as John Koskinen, an economist at DOR would say, compare February temperatures to July." When we asked MacIver to show us their math, spokesman Nick Novak responded: "We used Bureau of Labor Statistics QCEW figures for each month from January 2011 to September 2012 (the most recent month available). To get to the number of 137,372, we simply subtracted the January 2011 jobs number from the September 2012 jobs number." Novak provided a link to a BLS report that showed the two numbers. But, this isn’t just a simple math problem. MacIver made two critical errors in their calculations. Starting point Walker took office at the beginning of January 2011. MacIver used the number for the end of January 2011. To properly measure the governor’s promise, you need to start with the number of jobs that existed at the start of his term. That is a difference of 65,401 jobs. Here’s how it plays out the way the MacIver Institute calculated the numbers. January 2011 census number: 2,205,584 September 2012 census number: 2,342,956 Increase: 137,372. Here’s how it plays out with the December 2010 number. December 2010 census number: 2,270,985 September 2012 census number: 2,342,956 Increase: 71,971 In summary: MacIver’s math nearly doubles Walker job count because it started counting one month later. In effect, they used a lower starting point, which makes the growth seem larger -- by 65,401 -- than it really is. And even that is a bad number. Apples to oranges There’s a second, more important -- and more familiar -- problem. Like Walker in December, MacIver failed to line up a year-to-year comparison. It measured February temperatures against July. What’s more, the item itself notes that Koskinen, the state economist, told them they should not combine the data sets in this manner: While Koskinen called the numbers "literally true" the article goes on to note: "Koskinen said economists typically use the same month from different years to avoid seasonal variations in employment." Asked about this, Novak said: "In the article we account for the fact that this is not seasonally adjusted and that the chief economist from the Department of Revenue is wary of using data from different months when comparing data year over year." But they didn’t apply any such disclaimer to their headline, or a very large graphic. The claim was retweeted by Madison-based conservative talk show host Vicki McKenna to her 7,114 followers and Milwaukee talker Charlie Sykes posted it on his Right Wisconsin subscription-based website. PolitiFact Wisconsin follows Walker’s jobs promise using the Walk-O-Meter, using a method created with guidance from both state and academic economists, including Koskinen. We combine full year census reports with less accurate monthly employment survey results, and show the results in a monthly graphic. Once full-year information becomes available, it is added in to get an ever-stronger number. As of February 2013, our latest estimate of the number of jobs created since Walker took office is 63,700. Our rating The MacIver Institute posted an item that says Wisconsin has 137,372 more private sector jobs than when Gov. Scott Walker first took office, meaning that Walker is more than halfway to his goal of 250,000 jobs. The jobs promise will be the No. 1 yardstick used to measure Walker’s performance as governor. But the conservative group’s number is wrong, two times over. MacIver started with the wrong month of data. That alone nearly doubled the number of jobs they claim were created under Walker. They compounded their error by combining full and partial years of data -- even though they (like the governor himself) were told not to do so. Pants on Fire.

pomt-02346	"Our state economic development agency under Walker, WEDC, actually isn’t even using the funds that are appropriated to it."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/mar/23/mary-burke/mark-burke-says-wisconsins-job-agency-has-unspent-/	In 2011, Gov. Scott Walker led the transformation of the state Commerce Department into the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. The creation of a quasi-private agency was meant to spearhead job creation. After a rocky start, including staffing turmoil and a scathing audit in 2013 , WEDC executives say the agency is finally on solid ground. Walker’s Democratic challenger, Mary Burke, thinks otherwise. "Our state economic development agency under Walker, WEDC, actually isn’t even using the funds that are appropriated to it," she said in a Jan. 21, 2014 video interview with the Appleton Post Crescent. The claim caught our attention because Walker is less than half way to meeting his promise to create 250,000 private-sector jobs by the end of his four-year term. Is Burke right that the agency has not even spent the money it has been given to boost job creation? When we asked Burke for backup to the claim, campaign spokesman Joe Zepecki cited news stories and a Jan. 8, 2014 report from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau about the state of WEDC finances. That report was prepared as WEDC asked the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee to release the second year of the agency’s two year budget. WEDC leaders were ordered to appear before the committee so lawmakers could hear a progress report and get a detailed look at agency finances. The report said WEDC had a "surplus" of about about $18 million. That’s for an agency that has 90 employees with a budget of about $95 million. The agency also is allowed to issue employers some $300 million in economic incentives in the form of tax cuts. Not surprisingly, leaders of the agency viewed their performance differently. They say a good part of the the surplus stems from the switchover from the old Commerce Department. They also say the agency is track to spend all of it’s budget for the current fiscal year, which ends June 30, 2015. Burke’s claim is a "bumper sticker about a pretty complicated topic," said WEDC deputy secretary Ryan Murray. The surplus WEDC ended its last fiscal year, which closed in June 2013, with a surplus of $34 million. About $14 million of that was money that "carried over" from the old Commerce Department. The largest chunk -- $30 million -- was due to low demand for loans from the agency. In short, WEDC had expected to lend out $30 million more than was sought by businesses planning to relocate or expand in Wisconsin. The lower demand for loans came from the weak economic recovery, and also the rocky transition to the new agency, Murray said. The agency’s board took two actions to deal with this surplus. First, it created a new policy -- one overlooked when the agency was created in 2011 -- that creates a reserve fund of between 15 to 25 percent of the agency’s budget. The fund gives the agency greater flexibility to handle unexpected events, such as loans offered during propane shortages this winter. The reserve fund was set at $16 million for the current fiscal year. Secondly, WEDC sought for and received funding for the current fiscal year that was $18 million less than the agency’s original request. That action happened in January 2014, after WEDC executives were ordered to appear before the committee. In the end, the panel voted to provide $44.7 million in new taxpayer money for WEDC through June 2015. Spending pace Murray and WEDC spokesman Mark Maley also noted that the agency is on pace to spend its entire appropriation for the current fiscal year. The organization’s total appropriation for the fiscal year ending in June -- including programs, loans and operating expenditures -- is $95.2 million. Through the first six months of the fiscal year, WEDC has spent, made commitments or signed contracts totaling $53.4 million -- 56 percent of the total appropriation, Maley said in an email. That’s a good point. But, of course, it’s not what Burke was talking about. She was criticizing the $18 million surplus -- the amount that was left even after the creation of the reserve fund -- even though she spoke in the present tense. Our rating Burke says that Walker’s jobs agency "isn’t using the funds appropriated to it." She referred to WEDC’s well-documented surplus. No one disagrees about the amount, how it came about or what was done in response to it. Officials note the current budget is on track to be spent in its entirety. We rate Burke’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-12142	There are"thousands of Georgia workers that are misclassified as independent contractors," who lose benefits, including health care.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2017/aug/10/stacey-evans/are-georgia-firms-cheating-1000s-workers-out-healt/	With health care policy in limbo in Washington, the politicians who would like to be Georgia’s next governor are staking out their own policy outlines. Democratic State Rep. Stacey Evans favors expanding Medicaid, but said the state could take other action as well. "There are thousands of Georgia workers that are misclassified as independent contractors, so that their employers can wrongfully deny them the benefits that they deserve, including health care," Evans said Aug. 5. "By expanding Medicaid and classifying workers appropriately, insurance will be available to hundreds of thousands more Georgians." We decided to check Evans’ number of misclassified workers, and found she’s on safe ground. Defining misclassification Some businesses avoid treating workers as employees by calling them an independent contractor. The person might work only for that one business, use equipment the business provides and do exactly what the business tells him or her to do, and yet be labeled as if the person was in business for themselves. The advantage for companies is they avoid paying a number of employment taxes, including Medicare, Social Security and unemployment insurance. If they offer health insurance, they would sidestep that too. As Georgia’s Department of Labor put it, "independent contractors are not independent just because that is what their employer calls them, because that is what they call themselves, or because they sign an ‘independent contractor agreement.’ Independent contractor status depends on the underlying nature of the work relationship." In a recent case, a state administrative judge ruled that a man who drove for a Georgia limousine service was actually an employee and not an independent contractor, as the company (and the state Department of Labor) claimed. The company had required the man to set up his own limited liability corporation, but the ruling said that made no difference. The driver used a company car, and he was "given direction as to where to drive, when to drive, how to drive, how often to drive, and the rates to charge customers." The judge called this an "extreme" case of misclassification. The number in Georgia Evans’ campaign spokesman Seth Clark said she relied on a 2015 Georgia Senate study. That report said an accurate estimate was difficult to make because the state had never done a complete study, as other states have done. However, the state Department of Labor reported that its inspectors had found "over 4,000 misclassified employees," across about 1,700 businesses in 2014. When we asked, the state Department of Labor sent us more recent data. In 2015, it found about 1,500 misclassified workers at 1,800 firms, and in 2016, the number was about 3,000 out of 2,400 firms audited. Complaints by workers and random selection by inspectors trigger audits. The data show that most audits lead to the discovery of a misclassified worker. The department told us that currently, it lists nearly 235,000 employers. The review of about 2,400 represents a small fraction, about 1 percent. The Senate report said the department lacked the resources and manpower to "effectively audit and investigate potential violators." The Senate report listed other state studies. By and large, the more effort a state put into an investigation, the more it found. Minnesota estimated that about 14 percent of employers misclassified workers. Michigan found about 8 percent. A Maryland audit uncovered an average of 20 percent of employers misclassifying employees. In contrast, Nevada relied on records accumulated in the ordinary course of business and reported that while about 12 percent of complaints involved a claim of misclassification, the fraction of audits that found this problem was 2.7 percent. At the national level, the most recent numbers come from the Government Accountability Office. Its review of IRS data from 2008-10 found that worker classification problems represented 20 percent, or over 3 million cases, of noncompliance issues. It’s important to note that simply being classified as an employee is no guarantee of health coverage. Companies with fewer than 51 employees face no penalty if they fail to offer insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Our ruling Evans said that thousands of Georgia workers are misclassified as independent contractors and as a result, lose out on benefits, including health insurance. A state Senate study said there is no solid estimate of the number of misclassified workers, but state investigators had found between 1,500 and 4,000 instances in each of the past three years, or an average of 2,800 per year. That is based on a review of about 1 percent of businesses and most reviews reveal a misclassified worker. States that have conducted more systematic studies found misclassification rates in the range of 10 to 20 percent. The 2,800 average likely misses many instances and it’s a relatively small number, but it’s enough to support Evans’ statement. The connection to health care is less clear, because many small employers don’t offer health insurance, nor are they required to. But Evans was careful to include health care as one of several benefits, and her claim doesn’t hinge on that element. With that caveat, we rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-04731	Says Connie Mack IV co-sponsored a bill to "take a third of the Social Security Trust Fund ... give it in individual accounts to the senior citizens, who then were to invest it in the stock market."	false	/florida/statements/2012/aug/30/bill-nelson/bill-nelson-said-connie-macks-wants-take-social-se/	We’ve heard plenty about U.S. House budget chairman and vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan’s plans for Medicare lately, but what about his efforts to reform Social Security? U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson would sure like to discuss it -- and tie his opponent, Rep. Connie Mack IV to Ryan’s largely unpopular past plans for the program. "My opponent co-sponsored a bill with none other than congressman Paul Ryan, a bill to privatize Social Security," Nelson said. "Specifically what they did was they were going take a third of the Social Security Trust Fund, they were going to give it in individual accounts to the senior citizens who then were to invest it in the stock market." Never mind for a moment the claim that the GOP wants to privatize Social Security -- we’ve found that particular Democratic condemnation of personal savings accounts to be Mostly False, since they would be voluntary. Let’s delve into the specifics Nelson is citing, and find out how clear he is on the whole Republican plan. A taxing analysis Although Mack wasn’t mentioned by name, Nelson’s office told us the senator was referring to Ryan’s Social Security Personal Savings Guarantee and Prosperity Act of 2005, which was co-sponsored by Mack and 12 others. The proposal, which never became law, aimed to reform Social Security by allowing workers to divert some of their contributions away from the traditional Social Security program and into personal savings accounts. (Ryan has proposed several versions of this plan over the years.) That’s enough for Nelson to try to fire up his liberal base, but the specifics of his claim are off base. Nelson said this would rob the trust fund, which is funded through payroll taxes. But that fund was never going to have money taken directly from it, nor was the fund going to be abolished. The Ryan plans called for the fund to be compensated with general tax revenue in order to maintain benefit levels for people who stayed in the traditional system. We should note that the plan Mack co-sponsored would have allowed people to divert half their payroll taxes, not a third as Nelson said. An age-old debate More critically, Nelson said the Ryan-Mack plan would have senior citizens invest payroll taxes in the stock market. This gives the wrong idea about who would be affected. Every plan advanced by Ryan has stated the changes in the system would only affect workers younger than 55, with no changes in Social Security for workers and retirees older than that. No one older than 55 would even be eligible for the personal savings accounts, let alone be given an account to invest on their own. Among younger workers who chose to invest in the accounts, government oversight of the accounts would not allow them to invest on their own. The Social Security Administration would have ensured future retirees with those accounts would receive at least the equivalent in payouts as the traditional system, if not more so, if the investments had a higher rate of return. If the accounts fell short due to losses from the stock market, general revenue tax money was slated to cover the difference, which was a source of criticism after the Great Recession savaged investments in 2008. The accounts are no longer part of Ryan’s budget resolutions, the most recent of which passed the Republican-led House but not the Democratic Senate. The ruling Nelson said that Mack "co-sponsored a bill with none other than congressman Paul Ryan, a bill to privatize Social Security. Specifically what they did was they were going to take a third of the Social Security Trust Fund, they were going to give it in individual accounts to the senior citizens who then were to invest it in the stock market." There are few things wrong with this. The 2005 proposal Mack co-sponsored allowed one-half of payroll taxes to be used, not a third. Payroll taxes do replenish the Social Security Trust Fund, but the money to fund personal savings accounts would have been replaced with general revenue taxes to pay out traditional benefits.The trust fund would have remained balanced, with fewer people entering the system by using personal accounts instead. Redirecting one third of payroll taxes from the trust fund does not constitute removing one third of the total trust fund, in any case. Those accounts also wouldn’t have gone to senior citizens, as Nelson alleges, because no one over the age of 55 would have been eligible for the accounts in the first place. Every version of Ryan’s plan maintains this age limit. Nelson had a point that Mack has supported Ryan’s plans for private or personal accounts in the Social Security program. But his comments gave the wrong impression to a roomful of seniors that it would have affected them. A constant in Ryan’s budget proposals is the exclusion of senior citizens to any changes in the current system. We rate this statement False.

pomt-03000	Chris Christie "cut equal pay for women, calling it 'senseless bureaucracy.' "	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/17/debbie-wasserman-schultz/dnc-says-chris-christie-cut-equal-pay-wome/	New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie seems poised for easy re-election this November, one step on a path toward a possible 2016 presidential campaign. As Christie becomes a more prominent figure in the Republican Party, he’s subject to more criticism on the national level. U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., who oversees the Democratic National Committee, wrote a statement attacking Christie after a gubernatorial debate that gave us a taste of what we might hear more of over the next two years. For this fact-check, PolitiFact decided to hone in on her critique of the governor’s wage policy. "He cut equal pay for women, calling it ‘senseless bureaucracy,' " Wasserman said. ‘Senseless bureaucracy’ The New Jersey state legislature passed a package of four bills in September 2012 designed to narrow the pay gap. Christie signed one, gave conditional vetoes to two and an absolute veto to the other. Here’s a breakdown of each bill in the package and Christie’s actions: A-2647: Christie signed a statewide requirement for employers to notify employees of the right to be free from benefits and pay discrimination. A-2648: This bill was designed to extend protections for employees who reveal discriminatory actions in their workplaces. Christie vetoed this bill conditionally, because he wanted it to fall under a different existing law than what was proposed by legislators. The bill became law in August, after Christie’s changes were made. A-2649: Christie gave this bill an absolute veto. It called for government contractors to report employee gender and compensation information to the NJ Department of Labor. A-2650: This bill would grant back pay to victims of pay gap discrimination. Christie gave this a conditional veto because it didn’t specify a limitation for how far back pay could go. It hasn’t been passed. Assembly Bill A-2649, the bill requiring government contractors to report compensation by gender and the only absolute veto of the bunch, is the one Wasserman Schultz referred to in her critique of Christie’s attitude toward discrimination by gender. That’s the bill Christie described as "senseless bureaucracy." In his veto message, he wrote that the bill "will burden countless employers with onerous reporting requirements, thereby driving up the cost of public contracts, which are ultimately shouldered by the taxpayer ... the reporting requirements fail to advocate sound policy over senseless bureaucracy." The bill’s focus is on transparency surrounding pay, but it would not have directly required changes in salary by gender. Yasemin Besen-Cassino, a Montclair State University sociology professor, conducted research on New Jersey’s gender gap with the American Association of University Women. She said the bill Christie vetoed would’ve helped narrow the wage divide. "A lot of women claim they just don’t know how much men make," Besen-Cassino said. "One of the things that we found in our research was that making it public and at least available to a third party would push corporations toward equal pay." There’s a correlation between a greater level of pay equity in the federal government and also a greater level of transparency, an AAUW report said. New Mexico passed legislation a couple of years ago requiring contractors to report pay equity information. Fatima Goss Graves, National Women’s Law Center vice president for education and employment, said the law has proven to be uncontroversial there. Vermont also has a similar law. We should note that although Christie vetoed that bill and issued conditional vetoes for others, he has not abolished any existing equal pay legislation, as a reader might assume from the wording of Wasserman Schultz’s comment. "The governor has never ‘cut’ equal pay and he has a well-documented public position of supporting the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act (a national law) and equal pay for equal work," said Kevin Roberts, a campaign spokesman for Christie. Christie touted the importance of A-2647 and asserted his support for equal pay. "Too often, women's value and contributions in the workplace have been undermined and shortchanged merely because of their gender," he said after signing the bill. Equal pay in New Jersey We wanted to take a look at the issue of equal pay in New Jersey on a broader scale and the implication that equal pay rights have not moved forward under Christie’s leadership. The median pay gap suggests that a woman in the Garden State make 77 cents for every dollar a man makes. However, it’s important to remember that this number doesn’t control for factors like number of hours worked, occupation and race. The AAUW reports that one-third of the pay gap remains after these factors are controlled for. The national wage gap has not closed in the past decade, said Goss Graves of the National Women’s Law Center. New Jersey’s divide falls in the middle of the pack in terms of biggest wage differences, she added. "I think that for Jersey, like the rest of the country, this problem has been pernicious and persistent and it’s clear that we can’t just wish it away," said Lisa Maatz, American Association of University Women vice president of government relations. "We need some kind of legislative response." Our ruling Wasserman Schultz said Christie "cut equal pay for women, calling it a ‘senseless bureaucracy.’ " Christie didn't cut anyone's pay, though. Instead, he said it was "senseless bureaucracy" to require government contractors to report more employee information, including information about gender and compensation, and he vetoed a measure that would have mandated such reporting. Experts said the measure would have improved equal pay for women. But Christie also signed two other bills that may help narrow the wage gap in New Jersey. So we rate Wasserman Schultz’s statement Mostly False.	None	Debbie Wasserman Schultz	None	None	None	2013-10-17T12:07:51	2013-10-08	['None']
pomt-11120	Says Wisconsin ‘could compel’ Foxconn to install solar panels that would power 33,000 homes.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/jun/06/tony-evers/can-state-force-foxconn-install-solar-panels-publi/	Saying Wisconsin made a "bad deal" to bring Foxconn to the state, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Tony Evers argues Wisconsin should force the company to be the best corporate citizens in the state. He suggested the state put Foxconn’s "feet to the fire" to make the company provide high wages and benefits, as well as transportation for workers who do not live close to the Racine County plant. Then Evers took it one step further. "We could compel Foxconn to put solar panels on the roof, and there'd be enough electricity generated to serve 33,000 homes in southeast Wisconsin," Evers said in an April 22, 2018, interview on UpFront with Mike Gousha on WISN-TV (Channel 12). Evers said he thinks Foxconn — which has begun work on a $10 billion facility that is to employ up to 13,000 in Racine County — is "all in," so renegotiating shouldn’t jeopardize the deal. Can the state force such an action at this point? And, if it forced the solar panels, could the panels really power more than 30,000 homes? Let’s take a look. System would be unprecedented in scope Asked to back up the claim, Evers spokeswoman Maggie Gau said he was drawing from a Wisconsin State Journal column from August 2017. In the piece, John Imes, executive director for the Madison-based Wisconsin Environmental Initiative, presented the idea as a hypothetical. "Imagine if … all of the roofs on those facilities were covered with the latest solar panel technology?" Imes wrote. "The buildings would generate over 200 (megawatt-hours) of electricity each year, enough to power almost 33,000 homes." But experts say a solar system with the kind of capacity Evers describes would have to be several hundred megawatts -- unprecedented for a rooftop solar array. A handful of U.S. solar farms — in places like Arizona and California — have this capacity, but those are dedicated, ground-based units. PV Magazine, a solar industry publication, says the largest rooftop system now is less than 20 megawatts, though Tesla has begun work on one around 70 megawatts. Such a system at Foxconn could cost $250 million to $500 million, said David Feldman, an economic and financial analysis researcher with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Checking the math Experts disagree on whether a system that size would be enough to power 33,000 homes. The planned Foxconn campus will cover about 22 million square feet, though a company spokesman declined to specify how much roof square footage will be involved (multi-story buildings would obviously reduce the available roof space). Two of the three solar experts we talked with said a roof around that size could feasibly provide enough power. Cara Marcy, renewable electricity analyst with the U.S. Energy Information Administration, said a roof at 22 million square feet -- based on the typical sunshine in Mount Pleasant -- could generate about 430,000 megawatt-hours of electricity annually. That’s above the roughly 300,000 megawatt-hours that 33,000 homes would need, based on the typical energy usage in Wisconsin. Ben Zientara, lead researcher and policy analyst for Solar Power Rocks, said a solar array could be enough to power 33,000 homes at 13 million square feet, well below the size of Foxconn. However, that would require flat-mounted arrays, which would be more susceptible to snow buildup. But calculations by the Wisconsin Public Service Commission, which regulates public utilities in the state, showed solar panels on 22 million square feet of roof would only generate enough electricity for about 24,000 homes, said spokesman Matthew Spencer. All calculations required some assumptions or approximations based on the type of solar panels — fixed or movable on one or two axes to tilt with the sun — and the space between panels. Experts also noted not all of the roof space would be usable for solar panels. Physical limitations The size of such a project means it is much more than a math problem, however. Marcy said it’s not realistic to describe generators in terms of homes powered because solar power is so inconsistent. It is obviously not available at night, or for long stretches of winter. "The solar facilities are not necessarily generating electricity at the same time electricity is needed by the system consumer, so from that perspective I think it’s inaccurate to say it's meeting the electricity of these homes," she said. A typical solar array has a maximum capacity around 20%, meaning there is enough sunshine to generate electricity about one-fifth of the time, experts say. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s solar resource calculator assumes 16%, but Wisconsin would face a challenge typical high-use solar states would not — snow removal. Spencer, whose agency is run by three commissioners appointed by Gov. Scott Walker, said companies that install solar arrays typically use the electricity for themselves first, then sell any unused power back to the grid. Spencer said it is likely not legal for Foxconn to provide electricity directly to the public — as the claim suggests — without going through the agency to become certified as a public utility. Can state compel solar installation? This brings us to where Evers’ claim started – whether Wisconsin "could compel" Foxconn to build such a thing. Requirements like installing solar panels could be fair game as part of negotiating an incentive package for a company like Foxconn. But for Foxconn, those negotiations are already over. "Any discussions about what could have been included in that contract are hypothetical and moot at this point since the state already has an executed contract in place," said Mark Maley, spokesman for the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. The agency is run by a 12-member board of Republican appointees, though it includes two Democratic party representatives. Maley said contracts do change in some cases, such as if the agreed-upon number of new jobs changes. That would open up a new negotiating window where changes to the agreement itself could theoretically happen. Jack Huddleston, emeritus professor of urban and regional planning at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said trying to re-open negotiations now would be "pretty risky" for the state. "The Development Agreement (DA) that was agreed to by all involved parties was a result of trade-offs made by each party," he said in an email. "If Foxconn, for example, agrees to renegotiate, it may demand new requirements to compensate for the loss of previously agreed to components." Gau, the Evers spokeswoman, noted Foxconn has made investments in renewable power in other countries. "If they are doing this there, why not here?" she said in an email. "Companies can be compelled to follow certain hiring practices like wages and employing workers from certain geographic areas, why not renewable energy for on-site sustainability or surrounding homes?" Our rating Evers says the state "could compel" Foxconn to install solar panels, and those would have enough capacity to power 33,000 homes. Experts say the quoted capacity is theoretically possible, though it would be extremely expensive and vastly larger than anything put on a roof in the world to date. And the logistical issues are many. Meanwhile, Foxconn construction is underway and incentive agreements have been signed, so the state doesn’t appear to have a route to force such action unless outside factors lead to reopened negotiations.

pomt-11350	"Republicans in Congress are plotting to take away Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/apr/05/ron-wyden/do-republicans-congress-want-take-away-social-secu/	It’s been a time-tested Democratic attack line: Republicans are going to take away your Medicare, or maybe your Social Security. We gave a variant of the line our 2011 Lie of the Year. Now the talking point has re-emerged, in a March 29 tweet, from Oregon’s Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee: "#TrumpTax was only the beginning. After giving massive tax giveaways to wealthy & powerful shareholders, Republicans in Congress are plotting to take away Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com In reality, the notion that congressional Republicans are scheming to "take away" Medicaid, Medicare or Social Security is inaccurate. The Democratic news release The first piece of evidence undercutting the tweet’s message is actually linked in the tweet itself. An accompanying Senate Democratic press release, dated March 27, starts by saying, "It’s only been a few months since Republicans jammed through their massive giveaway to corporate executives and wealthy shareholders. Now they’re planning on paying for it with huge cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, despite President Trump’s promises that he wouldn’t do so." "Huge cuts," the phrase used in the press release, sounds scary. But it’s not the same as saying the Republicans will "take away" the programs. The release goes on to cite specific comments by Republican leaders. These comments focus on changes to "entitlements," the wonky term for federal programs that automatically allocate benefits to qualified recipients, rather than being dependent on Congress appropriating enough money every year. Entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid account for the largest share of the federal budget. The Senate Democratic release includes two separate comments from House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., in December 2017 talking about returning to entitlement reform in 2018. The release quotes Ryan at a subsequent press conference on March 20, 2018, saying, "The House passed the biggest entitlement reform bill Congress has ever considered last year, and regrettably the Senate did not follow suit. So we’re just going to have to keep at it on entitlements." These quotes suggest the Republican in charge of the House continues to seek overhauls of the entitlement system. Cutbacks aren’t the same as elimination However, none of the proposals being weighed by Republican lawmakers would eliminate the programs. And Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., does not share Ryan's zeal for taking up entitlement changes. For Medicaid, Republican-proposed cuts could lead to specific individuals losing their coverage. That was the case with GOP proposals to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Under these prior proposals, other beneficiaries might have experienced cutbacks in their Medicaid coverage. But the program itself wouldn’t have been taken away. The argument that Medicare or Social Security could be eliminated is even weaker. Even if cuts to these programs are proposed — usually through limiting inflation-adjustment formulas, raising taxes on benefits, or raising the retirement age — we’ve seen no plan that scraps the programs. Wyden’s staff tacitly confirmed that cuts are the GOP’s goal. They pointed us to President Donald Trump’s 2019 budget proposal, which calls for $15.3 billion in Medicare cuts and $6.5 billion in Medicaid cuts in just the first year. Wyden’s office added that Republicans have made no secret about their desire to "voucherize" Medicare (by giving beneficiaries a limited amount to purchase private insurance) and to raise the eligibility age for Social Security. Still, such ideas fall well short of what the tweet said. "Obviously the devil is in the details but reform does not equal ‘take away,’" said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. "And clearly there needs to be some changes to get these programs on fiscally sound footing." AshLee Strong, Ryan’s spokeswoman, told PolitiFact that "no one has ever proposed taking away these programs. This kind of hyperbole is what keeps our important entitlement programs on an unsustainable trajectory." The House already passed a bill that would have curbed Medicaid, but it died in the Senate. And the Senate -- where Republicans have just a 51-49 edge in a chamber that requires 60 votes for most legislative business -- is expected to be a graveyard for legislation to rein in Medicare and Social Security. Indeed, McConnell, R-Ky., said during his year-end press conference on Dec. 22, 2017, that he does not plan to bring up entitlement reforms in the current environment due to a lack of bipartisan agreement on the sensitive issue. "We had a missed opportunity during the Obama years, when you had divided government, like you did with Reagan and Tip O'Neill, to address the long-term unsustainability of some of our most popular programs, who currently don't meet the demographics of the country in the future," he said. Our ruling Wyden said, "Republicans in Congress are plotting to take away Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security." Some key Republicans, including Ryan, have long argued in favor of overhauling entitlement programs such as these by reducing the amount of money spent on them. However, no Republican proposal has been made to "take away" any of the three programs cited in the tweet. In addition, Wyden glosses over just how far away from passage even a more modest overhaul would be. We rate it False.

pomt-00499	"Since Scott Walker has been our governor, we’ve gone from 50 percent state funding for the" University of Wisconsin System "to 15 percent."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/aug/06/tony-evers/tony-evers-figures-are-wrong-attack-scott-walker-o/	NextGen America is a political group run by California billionaire Tom Steyer, who plans to spend $30 million on the 2018 elections trying to give Democrats control of Congress. On July 22, 2018, the group took a narrower focus, hosting a forum that was attended by four of the eight Democrats running for governor of Wisconsin. NextGen America’s target is younger voters. And at times, its event at the former Pabst brewery site in Milwaukee, brought out the whimsical side of the candidates. Mahlon Mitchell, a firefighter and firefighters union president, used his time for a closing argument to put on firefighter gear in under 60 seconds. And Tony Evers recited the Gettysburg Address and took a selfie with the crowd. But the forum was serious, too, including when the host asked: "What would you do to make college more affordable?" Evers answered first. He noted that as part of his role as the state supreintendent of schools, he serves on the state Board of Regents, which governs the University of Wisconsin System. Then he attacked Republican Gov. Scott Walker, saying: "Since Scott Walker has been our governor, we’ve gone from 50 percent state funding for the (UW) system to 15 percent." That would be a precipitous drop of 35 percentage points. All our fact checks in the governor’s race. Walker and the GOP-run Legislature did cut $250 million from the UW System in the 2015-’17 state budget. And Democrats have attacked Walker on education funding ahead of the Aug. 14, 2018 primary, as they compete to be the nominee running against the two-term incumbent in the Nov. 6, 2018 general election. But in this case, the attack misses. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. "Tony misspoke," his campaign spokeswoman Maggie Gau told us. "We acknowledge it's not correct. As much as we try to prevent them, no one is perfect and mistakes happen on the trail." UW System’s funding streams The UW System is composed of 13 campuses, including the University of Wisconsin-Madison, that offer four-year and advanced degrees, and 13 campuses that offer two-year degrees. Currently, its operating budget is about $6 billion per year, with about $1 billion — 17 percent — coming from state funding. To see whether that percentage has changed during Walker’s tenure as governor, we turned to a state agency, the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. (Federal funding and tuition are the two other largest sources of funding, and there are others, as well.) Here is how much of the UW System operating budgets has come from state funding since the year before Walker took office as governor: Fiscal year Percentage of UW System operating budget from state funding 2010-’11 21.1 percent 2011-’12 (Walker’s first year) 17.9 percent 2012-13 19.2 percent 2013-’14 19.2 percent 2014-’15 19.3 percent 2015-’16 16.6 percent 2016-’17 16.8 percent 2017-’18 17.1 percent So, state funding of the UW System was nowhere near the 50 percent Evers claimed when Walker took office. Rather, it was 21 percent. Since Walker became governor, state funding has been below the 21 percent. Now it’s at about 17 percent, a drop of about 4 percentage points since Walker took office — though above the 15 percent Evers claimed. Our rating Evers said: "Since Scott Walker has been our governor, we’ve gone from 50 percent state funding for the" University of Wisconsin System "to 15 percent." The gap is much narrower. State funding made up about 21 percent, not 50 percent, of the UW Systems’s operating budget when Walker took office. It’s now at 17 percent, not 15 percent. We rate Evers’ statement False.

pomt-11692	After enactment of the Republican tax bill, "school teachers can no longer deduct the cost of their classroom supplies on their taxes."	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/dec/27/jenna-fischer/jenna-fischer-office-tweets-outdated-info-teacher-/	Jenna Fischer, the actress best known as Pam on NBC’s The Office, prompted a bit of a Twitter tussle before Christmas. "I can't stop thinking about how school teachers can no longer deduct the cost of their classroom supplies on their taxes...something they shouldn't have to pay for with their own money in the first place. I mean, imagine if nurses had to go buy their own syringes. #ugh," Fischer tweeted on Dec. 23. The tweet attracted 66,000 retweets and 223,000 likes. (Fischer has about 750,000 followers.) But the tweet was wrong, relying on an outdated proposal. (After this fact-check was posted, Fischer deleted the tweet; see "After the Fact" below.) An existing provision in the tax code has allowed teachers to deduct eligible, unreimbursed classroom spending up to $250. The provision was expanded and made permanent in December 2015. The tax bill unveiled by House Republicans in November would have scrapped the deduction. But amid an outcry from teachers and their allies -- we wrote about opposition from Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., here -- it was stripped before the House and Senate passed identical versions of the bill and President Trump signed it on Dec. 22. (The Senate bill actually would have doubled the deduction, but that idea was rejected too.) A number of Twitter users pointed this out, including one identified as Matt Rossetto, who snarked later that day that Fischer’s tweet "is 100% wrong, because the final bill KEPT this deduction, but 14,000 RT’s later..." Fischer noticed Rossetto’s tweet and fired back, "It was capped at $250 which is woefully insufficient especially considering they shouldn't have to go out of pocket at all. #iloveteachers." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Some Twitter users, however, still found fault with Fischer, since $250 was always the limit for that particular deduction -- it was not lowered due to the new law. Rossetto, for instance, tweeted back, "It WAS $250 before the bill and hasn’t changed. If you’re going to grandstand, get it right." Finally, on Christmas Day, Fischer returned to Twitter to acknowledge her critics. She tweeted, "Thanks for your tweets! I had some facts wrong. Teachers surveyed by Scholastic in 2016 personally spent an average of $530 on school supplies for students. Teachers who worked at high-poverty schools spent an average of $672. The tax deduction was capped at $250." See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Fischer didn’t explicitly acknowledge that the $250 limit existed before the Republican-backed bill, but she was right on the other statistics. They refer to a national survey of 4,721 public school educators for Scholastic by the firm YouGov in July and August 2016. As of the time this article was published, however, Fischer’s initial correction tweet had garnered far less interest than her original one -- 830 retweets and about 6,600 likes. Our ruling Fischer tweeted that after enactment of the Republican tax bill, "school teachers can no longer deduct the cost of their classroom supplies on their taxes." As numerous Twitter users pointed out, that is incorrect -- the newly signed tax bill does not affect the existing deduction for teacher expenses. Fischer later acknowledged that "I had some facts wrong" and deleted the tweet. We rate her initial tweet False.

pomt-09682	"The Stupak Amendment doesn't just say you can't use your federal insurance subsidy to pay for an abortion, it says, if you're getting a federal subsidy of any kind, you're not allowed to buy an insurance plan that covers abortion even with your own money."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/16/rachel-maddow/maddow-says-stupak-amendment-bars-those-subsidies-/	An amendment to the House health care bill about abortion coverage continues to inspire political passions, driving a wedge between abortion-rights supporters who are outraged at what they consider a major loss for women's rights, and Democratic lawmakers who dread seeing their long-awaited reform effort potentially stalled due to the highly controversial debate. We've examined the role of abortion coverage in the health care debate numerous times, specifically as it relates to this amendment, including a recent claim by Rep. Nita Lowey . But on Nov. 12, 2009, MSNBC host Rachel Maddow addressed the issue again, and we thought we'd take another crack at it. "Congressman Stupak and his supporters say that this Stupak Amendment would simply maintain the status quo," Maddow said on her show. "It should be noted that that's baloney. The Stupak Amendment doesn't just say you can't use your federal insurance subsidy to pay for an abortion, it says, if you're getting a federal subsidy of any kind, you're not allowed to buy an insurance plan that covers abortion even with your own money. That's the first bit of dishonesty going on here." The amendment, sponsored by Reps. Bart Stupak, D-Mich., and Joe Pitts, R-Pa., was a last-minute addition to the House legislation and passed due to support from Republicans and antiabortion Democrats. It establishes restrictions on how abortion can be covered under the bill's virtual health insurance "exchanges." These exchanges are designed to help people buy coverage if they are not currently insured, or if they work for businesses that are too small to offer health coverage to employees. Essentially, the Stupak-Pitts amendment bars abortion coverage for those who choose the "public option," which is the House bill's federally administered, but privately funded, insurance plan. (Cases of rape, incest or a danger to the life of the mother are exempted.) The amendment also prevents anyone who accepts federal subsidies for health coverage from purchasing a plan with abortion coverage on the exchange. However, the amendment does allow people purchasing insurance on the exchange to choose a plan with abortion coverage if they pay for it without federal subsidies. Those who do accept subsidies can purchase an abortion "rider" -- that is, a separate policy covering abortion -- as long as they pay for it entirely with their own money. Many supporters of abortion rights argue that the amendment represents a severe infringement on a procedure that has been upheld by the Supreme Court. They say that relatively few women will be able to buy insurance on the exchanges without subsidies, making the exception for unsubsidized purchases close to meaningless. And they say that the idea of a "rider" isn't all it's cracked up to be. For one thing, abortion-rights supporters argue, women won't be likely to purchase separate coverage for a procedure they never expect to need. In addition, they say, insurance companies will be unlikely to offer abortion coverage because of the bill's logistical hurdles. For instance, the bill requires that insurers offering plans on the exchange that cover abortion also have to offer an identical plan that does not cover abortion. All of these factors, abortion-rights supporters say, indicate that insurers will simply take the path of least resistance and decline to offer abortion coverage. If this happens, the law could end up diminishing the abortion coverage options for people on the exchange. In our previous ruling, we drew a distinction between what the law does and what might possibly happen in the law's wake. The law spells out quite clearly that abortion coverage can be obtained on the exchange, even by those who are subsidized. By contrast, the notion that low demand for, and low supply of, abortion coverage could hamper women's access to abortion struck us as a different matter. We concluded that it's too speculative to say that this scenario will definitely come to pass. As we look at Maddow's statement, we'll start by giving her credit for using more careful wording than have many of her fellow abortion-rights supporters, including the subject of our prior fact-check, Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y. Whether by design or not, Maddow hewed quite closely to the actual language of the amendment when she said that "if you're getting a federal subsidy of any kind, you're not allowed to buy an insurance plan that covers abortion even with your own money." In fact, the amendment text does, on eight separate occasions, make a distinction between a "plan" and "supplemental coverage." Specifically, the amendment says that people who buy subsidized insurance on the exchange cannot buy an insurance "plan" that includes abortion coverage. But the amendment does allow subsidized people to purchase "supplemental coverage" that covers abortion, as long as they do it with their own money. We believe that Maddow's failure to mention the option of buying "supplemental coverage" -- a rider -- undercuts her broader argument that "if you're getting a federal subsidy of any kind, you're not allowed to buy an insurance plan that covers abortion even with your own money." We'll concede that the amendment's language does draw a distinction between buying a "plan" and buying "supplemental coverage," but the difference is likely to be lost on viewers without expertise either in the insurance business or in legislative drafting. We ran our argument by Maddow. She gamely disagreed. "I absolutely stand by my comment," she wrote in an e-mail. "Get real, you guys. It's crazy to argue that the real impact of the Stupak Amendment will be that women receiving federal subsidies (probably the vast majority of women in the exchange) will just buy 'abortion insurance,' since abortion wouldn't be covered as health care under their health insurance anymore. Women are really going to get a specific insurance rider that they'd pay for every month, for a procedure no one ever plans on having or thinks they'll ever have to have? Really? Come on." But we think her response only strengthens the argument that the law isn't, itself, barring abortion coverage. Saying, as she does, that the burden of purchasing or not purchasing "abortion insurance" would fall to women tacitly confirms that the law does indeed allow subsidized women on the exchange to buy abortion coverage. Meanwhile, contrary to suggestions that insurers won't offer abortion riders, our research shows that they do exist in at least three of the five states that already have rules similar to the Stupak amendment on the books. In Oklahoma and Kentucky -- both of which which bar insurers from offering elective abortion coverage as part of a comprehensive plan -- regulatory officials told PolitiFact that such riders do exist, because insurance companies must file paperwork with the state before they sell such policies. In addition, Paula Gianino, president and chief executive for Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis region, told the St. Louis Beacon that she estimates 7 percent to 10 percent of the roughly 6,000 abortions provided annually at its St. Louis facility are covered by private insurance. Since companies in Missouri are banned from purchasing plans with abortion coverage except by rider, these examples show that some abortion riders are being purchased in that state. However, none of these states keeps track of how many companies offer the riders, or how many people have purchased them. Ultimately, we'll give Maddow credit for linguistic care, but we continue to hold that the Stupak Amendment does not, as she suggests, prevent subsidized women on the exchange from buying abortion coverage. They can buy a rider that adds that coverage. We rate Maddow's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Rachel Maddow	None	None	None	2009-11-16T18:26:49	2009-11-12	['Stupak–Pitts_Amendment']
pomt-03920	Of six Rhode Island tax-credit programs worth about $35 million, "three companies got 90 percent of that -- CVS and two companies not even located in the state of Rhode Island."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/feb/24/gary-sasse/gary-sasse-says-90-percent-35-million-tax-credits-/	In the debate over taxes -- which ones to cut and which ones to raise -- any proposed change would result in winners and losers. During a discussion of taxes on the Feb. 10 edition of WJAR-TV's "10 News Conference," host Jim Taricani asked how taxes could be cut while still financing the services that governments need to perform. Gary Sasse, director of the Hassenfeld Institute for Public Leadership at Bryant University, said people need to be talking "about tax reform, not just tax cutting, the same debate that's going on nationally." "You asked why it's so expensive to live here. Well, we don't invest in things that will grow the economy [like] higher education," he said. "We have such an inbred system of crony capitalism that we have tax loopholes that make no sense. Good sound tax policy is lowering rates and not having government pick winners and losers by favoritism." Taricani asked Sasse if he was referring to "tax breaks for CVS and other types of things?" "Absolutely," said Sasse. "There was a study put out by the Division of Taxation. They only looked at six of our tax credits that totaled about $35 million, $36 million. Three companies got 90 percent of that -- CVS and two companies not even located in the state of Rhode Island. They were in California." Ninety percent of the tax credits were going to CVS and two California companies? We went to the Division of Taxation website and found the report Sasse was talking about. The division is required by law to report on six incentive programs, even though one was repealed in 2009 and the other is phasing out. The remaining four distributed $34.4 million in tax credits (not quite $35 million but close enough) to 39 entities. But one Woonsocket company, the pharmacy giant CVS Caremark, with a net after-tax income of $3.9 billion in 2012, got 59 percent of it. CVS got $4.9 million from the state through the Economic Development Corporation Project Status program, in which the EDC waives the sales tax for construction projects. (Only projects approved before July 1, 2011, could qualify.) CVS got another $15.4 million under the Jobs Development Act, which allows for a reduction in a company's corporate income tax rate if it creates and maintains a certain number of jobs. Total: just over $20 million. But wait, as the TV commercials say, there's more. Any entity that receives one of the six credits is required to disclose any other credits it gets from the state. During that fiscal year, CVS received an additional $4.4 million from four tax credits; nearly all of it from a $4.3-million state investment tax credit, which is designed to encourage investment in buildings and equipment. And what about the two out-of-state companies that Sasse was talking about? Both benefited from the controversial motion picture production tax-credit program, which was designed to encourage TV, motion picture and video production in Rhode Island. The credit can help production companies reduce their Rhode Island taxes. More often, those companies can raise money by selling unused tax credits -- typically through brokers -- to companies or individuals that owe Rhode Island taxes but have nothing to do with the entertainment business. The biggest tax credit for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2012, was an $8.1-million break to Paige Productions Inc. of Burbank, Calif., which was producing the ABC medical drama "Body of Proof" and filmed its initial episodes in Rhode Island. Another $2.9 million went to Moonrise LLC of Santa Monica, Calif., the production company that filmed "Moonrise Kingdom," a movie that has been nominated for an Academy Award in the best original screenplay category and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award in the category of best motion picture musical or comedy. Add them all together and you have three companies garnering $31.3 million of the $34.5 million in tax credits -- or 90.1 percent. "Keep in mind: that report is only dealing with six tax credits. There are others," Sasse said. "We ought to expand that report to look at more tax credits." Are these tax breaks worth the lost revenue? That’s a matter of opinion that we wouldn’t rule on. But we will remind readers that a PolitiFact Rhode Island article from Dec. 19, 2010, noted that there is a lot of debate over the real value of the motion picture production tax credit. The Rhode Island Department of Revenue was supposed to issue an evaluation of the incentives in January of 2012 but that report is still being prepared. We asked the Chafee administration for an explanation for the delay but didn't get a response. Our ruling Gary Sasse said that among six Rhode Island tax-credit programs worth about $35 million, "three companies got 90 percent of that -- CVS and two companies not even located in the state of Rhode Island." Sasse is rounding off some large numbers but he was, in essence, correctly quoting the state report he was citing. We rate the claim True.

pomt-14608	Says Ohio Gov. John Kasich had "the worst rating on spending of any governor in the country, Republican or Democrat."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/02/right-rise/does-john-kasich-have-worst-rating-spending-any-go/	The super PAC supporting former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is trying to counter a perceived challenge for moderate New Hampshire voters from Ohio Gov. John Kasich. The PAC, Right to Rise, is airing an ad in New Hampshire that declares Kasich "wrong on New Hampshire issues." It’s run at least 284 times on Boston television since Jan. 21, according to the Internet Archive’s Political Ad Tracker. The 30-second ad makes a number of claims, but we decided to focus on one surrounding spending. The ad claims Kasich had "the worst rating on spending of any governor in the country, Republican or Democrat." That’s a potentially devastating claim, especially since Kasich is selling the economic turnaround in Ohio as part of his presidential resume. It in large part hinges on Kasich’s decision to expand Medicaid in the state as part of President Barack Obama’s health care law. Where the claim comes from Right to Rise isn’t pulling its claim out of the air. The super PAC is accurately citing a report by the libertarian Cato Institute. Cato’s report, entitled Fiscal Policy Report Card on America’s Governors 2014, attempts to compare 48 of the nation’s governors on a number of fiscal measures. (Virginia and Alaska were excluded.) Overall, Kasich earned a score of 44, which Cato translated to a D. Only 12 Democrats, and no Republicans, scored lower. But Right to Rise is focusing on one subcategory of the overall scorecard, which measures spending changes. On that score, Kasich indeed finished dead last -- with a total of six. Cato found that Ohio proposed 5.7 percent growth in per capita spending and ended up with 8 percent growth in actual per capita spending. In its report, Cato makes clear that the spending measures we just cited -- proposed per capita spending and actual per capita spending -- are only for general fund budgets, which Cato describes as "the budgets that governors have the most control over." Proposed per capita spending is measured through fiscal year 2015, and actual per capita spending is measured through fiscal 2014. As wonky as that previous paragraph sounds, that makes all the difference in assessing the validity of Cato’s report, Kasich’s rebuttal, and ultimately Right to Rise’s claim. A quick primer on state budgets If you’ve followed any state budgeting process, you’ll quickly realize that there are different ways to describe what you call "the budget." Cato is honing in on the general fund budget, which is usually the part of the budget that lawmakers and governors have the most power to influence. Generally speaking, this is the money that lawmakers might fight over when it comes to spending on pet projects, or subsidies for sports stadiums, or economic development incentives. Again, generally speaking, general fund spending is the most unencumbered. But there are lots of other pots of money that ultimately make up a state budget. Road tolls might go into a trust fund where they must be re-invested in road-building projects. A state lottery system might guarantee all its proceeds to education funding. Fees for developers might be dedicated to infrastructure improvements. The federal government might pass millions of dollars to a state for a specific project or need (roads, health care, school lunches). That’s all money that the state spends, but lawmakers have fewer levers to pull to try and manage it. Kasich’s rebuttal Kasich’s campaign offers two rebuttals to the Right to Rise/Cato charge. The first deals with how you define the budget. If you expand the budget to include all funds, the spending increases Cato references at 5.7 percent and 8 percent shrink to about 2 percent. The second rebuttal involves an accounting change that the Kasich campaign says inflates Cato’s numbers in the first place. Kasich officials say Ohio transitioned about $2 billion in spending into the general fund from the overall "all funds" budget. Analyzing only the general fund budget "makes this accounting correction erroneously appear to be an increase, when an analysis of all state spending would reveal that total spending didn’t go up as a result of this, and that this move was merely a movement of funds between internal accounting lines," the Kasich campaign told PolitiFact. State officials told the Columbus Dispatch that the accounting shift came when the state moved a large chunk of Medicaid spending from the all-funds budget to the general revenue fund. The money, tied to Medicaid expansion as part of President Barack Obama’s health care law, originally was placed in the "all-funds" budget but was moved to the general revenue budget. "That substantially explains … why the (general revenue fund) grew," Timothy S. Keen, Ohio’s director of the state office of budget and management, told the Dispatch. "It’s not new spending. It’s an accounting change." Cato’s rebuttal to Kasich’s rebuttal This issue, now appearing in the campaign ad, boiled over in August when Kasich was asked about it on Fox News Sunday. CHRIS WALLACE: "Unemployment down from 9.1 percent to 5.2 percent. And the top income tax rate has been lowered from 6.2 percent to 4.9 percent. "But the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, gave you a ‘D’ on its government’s (sic) report card just last year, noting the budget grew 13.6 percent in 2014 and that over your time as governor, government jobs have increased 3 percent. A ‘D,’ sir?" KASICH: "Well, I don’t know who these folks are, Chris, another Washington group. But, look, we have the lowest number of state employees in 30 years and in addition to that, our budget overall is growing by about 2 percent or 3 percent, and our Medicaid growth has gone from 9 percent when I came in to less than 4 percent and no one has been left behind. We haven’t had to cut benefits or throw anybody off the rolls. So, we pay attention to the mentally ill and the drug addicted and the working poor." Kasich’s criticism prompted a response from Cato. Cato looked at the budget in a few new and different ways, including by removing any federal Medicaid contribution from the general revenue budget. That calculation found that Ohio general fund spending increased 3 percent to 5 percent annually from 2013-16. "By using the all-funds number, Kasich is trying to use federal spending to mask the quick increase in general fund spending," wrote Cato economist Nicole Kaeding. (Kaeding has since moved on to the pro-business Tax Foundation.) "Federal spending — besides Medicaid — is not increasing in Ohio that quickly. Kasich has little control over federal spending, but he is using it to hide how much Ohio’s state spending has grown during his tenure." We asked Chris Edwards, the director of tax policy studies at Cato, what he makes of the Right to Rise attack and Kasich’s rebuttals. Edwards agrees that a large part of the spending increase is tied to Kasich’s decision to expand Medicaid. "I understand Kasich says we unfairly used that in our study," Edwards said. "But it’s spending, and he did it." Our ruling In an ad targeted at New Hampshire voters, a super PAC supporting Bush said Kasich had "the worst rating on spending of any governor in the country, Republican or Democrat." Right to Rise is accurately citing a portion of a study by the Cato Institute that looked at one measure of spending for 48 of America’s governors in 2014. But Kasich disputes the study itself, and correctly notes that there are other ways to measure state spending, and that a shifting of dollars from one part of the budget to another affected the results. What to make of it all? This reminds us of some previous attempts to look at the spending records of governors running for president. And like in those cases, the result here might be a tad unsatisfying for people seeking clarity. Cato, in our judgment, did nothing to unfairly target Kasich. Yet, there is more to Ohio’s particular budget story that may leave viewers with a different impression. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-02689	"In my home state, nearly one in five Floridians live in poverty."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2014/jan/06/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-nearly-one-five-floridians-live-p/	Fifty years ago, President Lyndon Johnson declared war on poverty. Since then, says Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., taxpayers have spent $20 trillion on welfare and other government programs intended to lift them out of poverty -- yet tens of millions of Americans are still impoverished. "In my home state, nearly one in five Floridians live in poverty," Rubio said in a Jan. 5 video message. "After 50 years, isn’t it time to declare big government’s war on poverty a failure?" Rubio called for a new agenda to help people lift themselves out of poverty and create a new "opportunity society" to enable people to live the American dream. Rubio is expected to release additional details Wednesday during a speech at the U.S. Capitol hosted by the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. Rubio released his video as the Senate returns to take up the issue of renewing emergency unemployment benefits that lapsed in December. Also, Democrats have announced that they will target income equality as a top issue this election year, including a push to raise the federal minimum wage. Here we will fact-check Rubio’s claim that nearly one in five Floridians live in poverty. Census data on poverty and Florida First, some background. The Census Bureau, the official federal record-keeper for poverty rates, determines poverty status by comparing annual income to a set of dollar values called poverty thresholds that vary by family size, the number of related children and the age of the householder. For example in 2012, that would mean a single person earning $11,720 or a family of four earning $23,492 would be considered poor. A Rubio spokesman told PolitiFact Florida that he arrived at his figure of nearly one in five Floridians based on a story in the Sarasota Herald-Tribune that said Florida’s poverty rate was 17.1 percent in 2012, according to the census. In 2012, Florida had a higher percentage living in poverty than the national average of 15.9 percent. Using the 2012 figure of 17.1 percent would place the number of Floridians in poverty closer to one in six than one in five. "You’re correct that 17.1 is between one-in-six and one-in-five," Rubio spokesman Alex Conant told PolitiFact in an email. "He said 'nearly' 1 in 5, but he could have said "more than" 1 in 6. Either way, I think we can all agree that 17.1 percent is too high a number." (The numbers are even worse if we zero in on Rubio’s home county of Miami-Dade where about one in four residents lived in poverty in 2012.) Another way to look at the percentage of Floridians in poverty is by using the census’ three year average between 2010-12. That average showed that 15.4 percent of Floridians lived in poverty -- or about one in six Floridians. One footnote: While we’re not rating Rubio’s claim that the war on poverty is a failure, we will note that in 1964 the official poverty rate was even higher nationally than it is now -- 19 percent. Our ruling Rubio said that "nearly one in five Floridians live in poverty." He points to 2012 census data which showed that 17.1 percent of Floridians lived in poverty, which would mean about one in six Floridians live in poverty. The percentage is slightly lower if we look at the three year average which showed 15.4 percent living in poverty -- still about one in six. Rubio’s numbers are close. We rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-12009	"Since we took office, we have been outpacing the nation in job growth."	half-true	/missouri/statements/2017/sep/21/eric-greitens/missouri-really-outpacing-nation-jobs-greitens-too/	Republican Gov. Eric Greitens has been pushing job growth since his 2016 campaign. In a Facebook live video on Aug. 23, Greitens said there has already been substantial improvement since he took office in January. "Since we took office, we have been outpacing the nation in job growth," he said. Is Missouri really "outpacing the nation" in jobs? We wanted to find out. By the numbers The number of jobs added from January through July 2017 increased by 0.9 percent over the same period in 2016. Greitens compared Missouri to the national average job growth over the same time, which was 0.8 percent. Between January and February of 2017, Missouri job growth increased by 0.0012 percent whereas national job growth increased by 0.0016 percent. However, Missouri experienced a 0.005 drop in jobs between February and March. Greiten’s Press Secretary Parker Briden claims that the governor has created more than 35,000 jobs since then. "Since March, we have created 37,200 jobs, while the United States as a whole has created 792,000," Briden said. "Thus, in that time we account for approximately 4.7 percent of total job creation in the country, performing far better than the national average." The standard metric for tracking job growth at the national and state level is the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Current Employment Statistics survey. As far as numbers go, Greitens has a point. But can he take credit for the job spike? In 2016, Missouri experienced a 0.2 percent hike in job growth. The same upward trend goes for 2014 and 2015, where jobs grew by 0.5 percent in the first seven months of each year. So, jobs had been added at a decent clip before Greitens took office, though not as much as this year. BLS' data shows the state of Missouri at a steady increase in job growth over the past five years. "Most economists would say that it’s highly unlikely anything he did in the first eight months of office is the reason for this job growth," said Peter Mueser, an economics professor at the University of Missouri’s Truman School of Public Affairs. Mueser even went on to say that most of the time, governors don't have enough control to cause employment growth or decline. "Lots of things contribute to the economic growth that the governor doesn't have control of," he said. "Over time, population increases and every so often it's easier to claim that employment grows because of the population growth." Bills for businesses Greitens’ major initiatives on the economy or workforce have either not yet taken effect or only recently became law. In January, Greitens signed SB 19, a "right-to-work" bill that allows workers to opt out of joining a union. Greitens pledged to pass this bill while on the campaign trail and signed the bill in an abandoned warehouse in Springfield. The bill was supposed to take effect on Aug. 28. However, after more than 300,000 petitions (more than triple what is required to put a bill on the ballot) were submitted, "right to work" will instead be moved to the Nov. 28 ballot for the public to decide. Another bill the governor has signed but only recently went into effect is HB 130, which requires transportation network companies, such as Uber and Lyft to pay a one-time $5,000 licensing fee and conduct driver background checks and vehicle inspections. Pacific Republican Kirk Mathews sponsored the bill and says regulations will keep transportation network company drivers in Missouri. The bill is expected to created up to 10,000 new driver jobs in the state but was five days away from becoming law when Greitens made his statement. Greitens also signed SB 43, which will make it tougher for fired workers to prove employment discrimination. The governor, who signed the bill in June, said the new law will "prevent trial lawyers from killing good jobs." Our ruling Greitens said, "Since we took office, we have been outpacing the nation in job growth." Missouri did outpace the national average in job growth from January to June in 2017. However, Missouri’s jobs have been on a steady uphill climb since 2014, long before Greitens took office. And although Greitens has passed multiple laws affecting employment and businesses, these bills did not go into effect until Aug. 28. So there is no evidence that the continued job growth in Missouri is because of his management. Even Greitens’ press secretary didn’t provide information on how exactly Greitens has increased job growth except employment numbers. When asked for further examples on how the governor has created 37,200 jobs, Briden did not return request for comment. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-00022	Says photo of man shows "diseases coming across the border."	false	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/nov/06/blog-posting/dated-photo-used-make-false-claim-about-migrants-d/	A 2014 photo of a man with a rash has been dredged up and re-posted on Facebook by a group that claims numerous diseases are coming across the border into the United States. But the accompanying photo is four years old. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar shared the original photo with the Houston Chronicle in 2014, along with a series of other images that showed cramped and unsanitary conditions in a Customs and Border Protection facility in South Texas. The claim that immigrants bring infectious diseases isn’t new. We’ve fact-checked a couple iterations of the claim over the years. In 2014, a congressman said migrants may be bringing the Ebola virus across the U.S.-Mexico border. We rated that Pants on Fire. In 2015, Donald Trump said, "Tremendous infectious disease is pouring across the border." At the time, the health experts we spoke with agreed that there was no evidence of massive influx of infections across the border. Most recently, other posts have gone viral about the migrants in the caravan heading toward the U.S.-Mexico border supposedly bringing diseases. There are no known reports of this being the case, according to The New York Times. The photo in the Facebook post is from a particular outbreak of scabies in 2014. Scabies is a treatable skin condition, but it can spread rapidly under crowded conditions. That outbreak was largely contained to migrants living in close quarters in detention centers. Only a small handful of border patrol agents appear to have contracted it. There is some evidence that diseases cross between the U.S.-Mexico border, but the Center for Disease Control attributes spread of disease in that region not to illegal immigration but to legal back-and-forth between the United States and Mexico. Our ruling There is no evidence that undocumented immigrants to the U.S. are carrying deadly diseases. Spread of disease is more likely from the much larger numbers of legal crossing across the border and the number of international travelers visiting other countries and then returning to the United States.

pomt-00577	"500 percent more traffic here?"	mostly true	/texas/statements/2015/jun/09/anonymous-activist/austin-yard-signs-suggest-office-tower-project-cou/	A chunk of residential Northwest Austin has bridled at the prospect of a low-rise office park becoming much more. Our attention was drawn to yard signs suggesting the towering redevelopment at the southwest corner of Spicewood Springs Road and MoPac Boulevard (Loop 1) would quintuple area traffic. Dallas-based Spire Realty Group LP seeks a zoning change to build up Austin Oaks, an office complex with 12 buildings of two to three stories each. In a version of its proposal made public in 2014, Spire said that on the parts of the site closer to MoPac, it wanted to build two office buildings of 17 stories each, though those plans have since been trimmed to 10-story buildings or so, according to Steve Drenner, an Austin lawyer representing Spire in its zoning case. Initial plans, also since modified per Drenner, called for up to 610 apartments and townhomes in the three- to five-story buildings, plus retail and restaurant space. The soonest construction was planned to start was around 2020, after existing office leases expire. The "500%" signs don’t reveal any group or person as the originator or sponsor. By phone, Ann Denkler, a volunteer with a coalition opposing the redevelopment, told us the group did not create them. City 'unable to verify' traffic impact We reached out to city officials at first, wondering what data were available. By email, spokeswoman Sylvia Arzola told us: "The project and the traffic impact analysis are currently under review. At this time we are unable to verify the traffic impact until a full evaluation of the project and accompanying mitigation is provided by the developer." Meanwhile, we found something close to the 500 percent claim in a September 2014 presentation by Jim Duncan of Austin, a city planner by profession. Duncan said he developed the presentation at the urging of a neighborhood friend and based his traffic projection on an engineering report written by another firm at the developer’s request. That report, Duncan said, indicated daily car trips near the proposed Austin Oaks Planned Use Development would increase from 4,118 to 23,804 once the expansion was finished--a 478 percent uptick. We turned back to Arzola, who agreed by email it looks like the traffic figures indeed came from "the developer’s consultant’s study." However, she noted, a fresh traffic analysis was released in May 2015 based on the developer changing what it seeks to build. Duncan said he’d heard the revision talk and for that reason, he said, his calculation of the potential 478 percent increase in daily car trips near the project would likely be outflanked. "I’m sure the number is lower" now, Duncan said. Traffic impact studies Arzola emailed us two traffic studies for the project, dated a year apart, and another city official, Bryan Golden, emailed us excerpts from a study completed in August 2014 (which looked to us like the one Duncan relied on). Each study presents predicted "unadjusted daily trips" in the area should the project be built out with predicted increases ranging from more than 300 percent to more than 480 percent. Generally, "unadjusted daily trips" means daily car trips in an area, a city official told us, without reductions accounting for trips internal to a development, say, or trips there on city buses. An unadjusted count rolls in trips expected due to existing developments plus the additional trips expected once the project is finished, Bryan Golden told us by email. The projections are generated by an engineering industry "calculator," Golden said. The initial June 26, 2014, traffic impact analysis was completed by a professional engineer, Bobak J. Tehrany, for Bury-AUS, Inc. That analysis, of 14 nearby intersections and 11 proposed driveways, said the redevelopment on completion in 2031 would generate an additional 20,736 unadjusted daily trips by car compared to some 4,248 daily trips attributed to the existing office complex — which breaks out to an eventual 488 percent increase. With the redevelopment, Tehrany wrote, all but two of the nearby intersections would need improvements. That is, he said, "the maximum desirable volumes are currently being exceeded along the roadway segments which were evaluated," though he also said that doesn’t mean the roadways had exceeded their respective capacities. The Aug. 19, 2014, traffic impact analysis--taking into account a nearby intersection the city wanted to add to the analysis, Amanda Swor of Drenner’s firm told us by email--suggested the project would result in nearly 19,700 additional unadjusted daily car trips, up 478 percent from 4,118 of late. We didn’t get a fix on why the count of current-day traffic went down. Most recently, the May 22, 2015, traffic impact analysis filed on behalf of the developers states: "Based on the proposed land use intensities, it is anticipated that the development will generate a total of 19,819 unadjusted daily trips; however, due to the existing office land uses, the proposed redevelopment is anticipated to generate a net increase of 15,701 unadjusted daily trips. This is taking into consideration the trips which already exist on the roadway network due to the existing development." That is, once the development is done, nearby traffic would be up 381 percent from the 4,118 daily car trips of late. Developer's advocate says traffic likely to increase less By phone, Drenner pointed out the May 2015 analysis includes a chart suggesting that once adjustments are made to account for car trips internal to the development, there would actually be a 332 percent increase in traffic. He said this latest analysis was based on Spire’s modified development plan—halving the number of residential units and reducing retail uses — filed with the city April 30, 2015. Drenner said, too, the developers are suggesting $1.5 million in spending to improve nearby streets and creation of a fund that would accumulate money for area road improvements. Next, we wondered how much traffic near the site would increase if the developers added nothing. Denkler and Golden counseled that analysts assume a 2 percent annual increase in car trips. At our request, Golden calculated the 4,118 current unadjusted daily car trips would escalate 37 percent to 5,653 in 2031--again, provided there’s no expansion on the site. Our ruling Yard signs posted in opposition to a proposed Northwest Austin redevelopment say: "500 percent more traffic?" Traffic studies filed in 2014 based on the developer’s original proposal support the 500-percent figure, yet the developer later submitted a revised plan and its May 2015 traffic analysis suggests at most a 381 percent increase in daily car trips, still a substantial spike. Perhaps the project and predicted traffic effects will continue to change. For now, taking into account the information available when the signs were made, we rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-03889	Says his proposed education spending "is the highest state funding level in Florida history."	half-true	/florida/statements/2013/mar/05/rick-scott/rick-scott-touts-his-education-plan-third-state-st/	Gov. Rick "Let’s get to work!" Scott may be trying out a new slogan for his re-election campaign. More and more, his priorities are screaming "Let’s get to class!" Scott devoted much of his third State of the State address on Tuesday to education, singling out educators as special guests and asking lawmakers to stand in honor of their favorite teacher. Then he turned to another telltale sign of showing love: showing them money! To polite applause, Scott reiterated his desire for the Legislature to give teachers a $2,500 across-the-board raise. He asked lawmakers to use his proposed education spending, which calls for an increase of $1.2 billion from last year, as their guide as they craft the state’s 2013-14 budget. "Our total education investment of $10.7 billion in state funding for K-12 schools this year is the highest state funding level in Florida history," he said. "This represents an increase of more than $400 in per student funding over the current fiscal year." Is he right? We’ll explain. Scott’s statement is carefully crafted to specify that his budget proposal would provide the highest state funding level ever. Scott’s proposal would be the highest ever in terms of the state government’s actual dollar investment. In second place would be the 2007-08 budget signed by Gov. Charlie Crist, when the state allocated $9.71 billion. But this doesn’t tell the entire story. Schools have a complex funding formula that involves a mix of local taxes, state dollars and, in recent years, federal stimulus money. If Scott had his way, Florida’s total K-12 education budget would be $18.47 billion (the Legislature decides how to spend the state’s dough). If Scott gets the budget he wants, it would not be the highest spending on education ever. It would trail the 2007-08 budget signed by Gov. Charlie Crist by $280 million. Education spending per student tells the same story. Yes, at $3,941, the state’s share of per-pupil spending in Scott’s budget would be the highest dollar investment. But this view again neglects the complete picture of education spending. Total per-pupil funding proposed in Scott’s budget would be $6,700. This would be a $412 increase from the current year, but it lags behind per-pupil spending of $7,126 in the 2007-08 budget signed by Crist. This is an important point: Six years ago, the state had fewer students but spent more money on each. Now we have 85,000 more students but spend less money on each one, according to Department of Education data. We wondered if Scott’s proposal would hold up as the state’s biggest education investment when adjusted for inflation. Using a Consumer Price Index calculator from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we compared Scott’s proposal with state spending on education for the past 10 years. We found state spending on education, when adjusted for inflation, would not be significantly different than it was from 2004 to 2007. Our ruling Scott talked up the state’s share of education spending in his budget proposal as an historic investment, and it is in terms of actual dollars. But his overall recommendation for education spending remains short of what Florida students received before the economic crash, and about the same as it was from 2004 to 2007 when considering inflation. Scott’s claim is partially accurate but missing important details. We rate it Half True.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2013-03-05T15:38:19	2013-03-05	['None']
pomt-02126	Wendy Davis "was just doing a fund-raiser in Chicago with the international socialists organization."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2014/may/09/david-dewhurst/dewhurst-claim-wendy-davis-raised-money-socialists/	Wendy Davis became debate fodder late in a roundtable showdown between Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst and state Sen. Dan Patrick, who will meet in a May 27, 2014, runoff for the Republican Party’s lieutenant governor nomination. Toward the end of their quarrelsome give-and-take joust, hosted May 7, 2014, by WFAA-TV in Dallas, Patrick blamed Dewhurst for igniting Davis’ gubernatorial bid with his oversight of the Texas Senate in the summer 2013 special legislative session in which Davis, a Democratic senator from Fort Worth, filibustered GOP-sought abortion restrictions. Dewhurst scoffed, saying that Republican Greg Abbott, the state attorney general, is winning the governor’s fray. "And Wendy Davis’s star is falling, not rising," Dewhurst said. "She was just doing a fund-raiser in Chicago with the international socialists organization." She was? We put that claim to the Texas Truth-O-Meter. We asked Dewhurst’s campaign spokeswoman, Eliza Vielma, for the basis of Dewhurst’s claim, and, by email, she pointed to May 6, 2014, Abbott campaign press release. The Abbott release quoted a Chicago Sun-Times news blog post previewing Davis as a featured guest at a May 5, 2014, Chicago fund-raiser for U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill. Abbott’s release also cited an Oct. 16, 2010, post on "The Corner," a National Review Online blog that describes itself as a "web-leading source of real-time conservative opinion." The 2010 post, by Stanley Kurtz, a senior fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based Ethics & Public Policy Center, said that while researching his book, "Radical-in-Chief: Barack Obama and the Untold Story of American Socialism," he came across "documentary evidence" that Schakowsky was a member of the Democratic Socialists of America at the start of her political career. Kurtz closed his post by saying the "idea of socialist politicians working openly or quietly within the Democratic Party is not a wild impossibility but a real phenomenon." No documents were included in the post to back up Kurtz’s claim that Schakowsky was a member of the socialist group. So we followed up with him. By email, Kurtz said Schakowsky was an "active member" of Chicago’s DSA chapter in the 1980s, a conclusion he said he based on chapter newsletters from 1983 and 1986 that he said he viewed in archives at New York University. "I do not know how long" Schakowsky "remained a member of the DSA," Kurtz wrote. After we published this fact check, Kurtz told us by email, he sent Breitbart Texas copies of the relevant newsletter pages. Schakowsky is credited as the author of an article in the February/March 1983 issue of the Chicago Socialist, published by the Chicago chapter. Her article recapped a Joliet meeting of the Illinois Public Action Council, a mix of progressive groups. A June 1986 newsletter item, headlined "DSAers on the move," included a sentence stating that on the local political scene, a DSAer had been hired by the chairman of the Illinois Democratic Party while Schakowsky’s bid "for Cook County Board got a boost when she drew 2nd ballot position among 14 candidates." The Cook County Board of Commissioners is the county’s legislative body. Also by email, Bob Roman, secretary of the Chicago DSA chapter, told us the posted excerpts were authentic. Schakowsky’s House spokesman, Lee Whack, referred us to her campaign political director, Alex Armour, who didn’t engage. By telephone, Maria Svart, the national director of the DSA, noted the group is an activist and educational group and not a political party. She also reaffirmed what a predecessor in that role, Frank Llewellyn, told PolitiFact in 2011. To join the group, a person must fill out a form and pay dues, Llewellyn said, adding that the last member of Congress who was a card-carrying member was California Democratic Rep. Ron Dellums, who served 28 years in the House until leaving in 1998. Svart also said that while the group doesn’t announce its members, as far as she knows, Schakowsky isn’t a member and never was. Separately, we spotted a web post by the Chicago chapter of the DSA showing Schakowsky spoke at the group’s May 13, 2011, Eugene V. Debs-Norman Thomas-Michael Harrington dinner celebrating union organizers and other activists on the left. A May-June 2011 DSA recap said Schakowsky told guests that despite Democrats being the House minority, she was optimistic in that conservatives in Congress had over-reached. A DSA web page on the history of the annual dinner lists Schakowsky as the 2000 dinner’s honoree. That listing led to another web post detailing why Schakowsky was honored, touching on her actions as a consumer advocate and state and federal legislator. It didn’t speak to her membership (or not) in the DSA. By phone, Roman said Schakowsky is "not somebody that we claim as a member." He also said he generally doesn’t comment on whether anyone is current or former member. "Once you say ‘so and so’ is a member, was a member or was never a member, then you open yourself to queries about any single person who has ever been a member," Roman said. To our inquiry, Davis campaign spokesman Zac Petkanas (fairly new to Texas) said of Dewhurst’s statement: "That’s potentially the most absurd claim I’ve ever heard." Petkanas emailed us a copy of the invitation to the Schakowsky event attended by Davis. The invitation lacks mention of Davis--and lists Winstead as the star attraction. Petkanas also provided what he described as the prepared text of Davis’ remarks at the event, which do not include an appeal for donations to Schakowsky’s political kitty. "Davis stopped by the event to talk about Texas and give an update on her campaign," Petkanas said. Our ruling Dewhurst said Davis raised money in Chicago for a socialist organization. Davis appeared at a fund-raiser for a Democratic U.S. House member who may have participated in DSA chapter meetings in the 1980s. There’s no sign Schakowsky is a current DSA member, nor is there evidence Davis raised money for a socialist group. This claim shakes out as incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

pomt-13447	"Over the last 40 years, this country’s prison population has grown by 500 percent."	mostly true	/california/statements/2016/sep/16/kamala-harris/mostly-true-americas-prison-population-has-skyrock/	During her run for U.S. Senate, California Attorney General Kamala Harris has touted a "smart on crime" approach that focuses on the most violent offenders and reducing recidivism. Harris believes this strategy is key to slowing what she claims is a dramatic rise in the nation’s prison population. "Over the last 40 years, this country’s prison population has grown by 500 percent," Harris said on her campaign website, and in a recent tweet that included a stark black and white picture of prison bars. "We have a responsibility to ensure agencies focus on preventing crime -- not just fighting crime after the fact," Harris added in the tweet. Harris is competing with U.S. Rep. Loretta Sanchez to replace retiring Sen. Barbara Boxer in November’s election. All three are Democrats. We decided to check whether Harris stretched the truth in her claim about the rapid rise in America’s prison population. Our research We relied on data from the Sentencing Project. The criminal justice advocacy group is considered a credible source for incarceration figures. Its data was cited by the national PolitiFact team in a recent fact check on a similar claim. The Sentencing Project’s data show there are 2.2 million people in the nation’s federal and state prisons and local jails -- a 500 percent increase over the past 40 years. For comparison, the overall United States population has increased just 51 percent during that period. Available numbers from the U.S. Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Statistics agree with those from the Sentencing Project. Harris’ claim is slightly different in that it cites the nation’s spike in "prison population" rather than a combined increase in prisons and jail figures. Some might read her statement as including both prison and jail inmates, but there’s a significant difference between the two. To assess Harris’ more limited claim, we examined the rise of the prison population alone. The Sentencing Project’s data show the nation’s prison population grew from 218,466 in 1974 to 1,508,636 in 2014, which is a nearly 600 percent increase. Unlike most politicians, it appears Harris understated her legitimate point. More background Harris’ claim and stance on prison reform is significant given California’s overcrowded prisons. At nearly 600,000 people, California has the second largest correctional population among states, behind only Texas’ nearly 700,000, according to the U.S. Justice Department. Those figures include prison and jail inmates and people on probation and parole. Source: U.S. Justice Department Harris’ claim centers on the rise of prison inmates over the past four decades. Over the past few years, however, America has seen a decline in prisoners. The nationwide total dropped about 100,000 from 2009 to 2014, according to the Sentencing Project. Reforms in California account for much of that drop, as the state has reduced its prison population by about 50,000 following a 2009 federal court order to do so, according to a report by the Public Policy Institute of California. In November, Californians will vote on Proposition 57, a measure proposed by Gov. Jerry Brown designed to ease the state’s prison overcrowding. It would allow some offenders to be considered for parole earlier than now possible. A campaign spokesman said Harris has declined to take a position on Prop 57, or any ballot measure, because as attorney general she is charged with writing an independent summary and title for each measure. The spokesman pointed to data from the Sentencing Project and other academic reports to back up Harris’ claim about the prison population. Our ruling U.S. Senate candidate Kamala Harris recently said "Over the last 40 years, this country’s prison population has grown 500 percent." Data show the nation’s combined prison and jail population has grown 500 percent over this period. But when isolating just the prison population, the data shows that group has soared by nearly 600 percent. No matter how you crunch the numbers, they show a dramatic rise in incarceration -- one that actually exceeds what Harris stated. Her statement is on the right track, but needs this clarification. We rate it Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-06001	"Romney signed government-mandated health care with taxpayer-funded abortions."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/19/newt-gingrich/gingrich-ad-says-mitt-romney-enacted-taxpayer-fund/	Did Mitt Romney make taxpayer-funded abortion the law of the land in Massachusetts? That’s one claim in an attack ad put out by Newt Gingrich’s campaign, which says Romney called himself "pro-life" but "governed pro-abortion." "Romney signed government-mandated health care with taxpayer funded abortions," the ad says, as a downcast Romney appears onscreen, along with his signature. This is a claim that’s sure to be repeated, so we decided to look into it. What’s in the law? First, what’s not in the law: the word "abortion." The sweeping health care legislation Romney signed on April 12, 2006, aimed to extend health insurance coverage to nearly every Massachusetts resident. It included an individual mandate, requiring almost all Massachusetts residents to get insurance, leading to an insured rate of nearly 98 percent in the state. It required people who don't have health insurance to buy it or lose their individual state tax exemptions. To cover low-income people, private insurance companies developed low-cost plans that residents could buy through a new state-run insurance exchange called the Health Connector. But the law doesn’t address what is covered and what isn’t. Search the text of it, and "abortion" is nowhere to be found. "It doesn’t say in the law what is covered or not. It talks about health care and funding health care," said Anne Fox, president of Massachusetts Citizens for Life, which opposes abortion. Yes, abortion is covered A 1981 Supreme Judicial Court ruling in Massachusetts said that the cost of abortions had to be included in publicly subsidized plans. Most private insurance plans in the U.S. include abortion coverage, and the state-subsidized plans in Massachusetts do, too. So when the Health Connector began, abortion coverage was automatically included. In some of the low-cost plans, abortions are covered with a $50 co-pay. So Gingrich’s ad is right that some abortions in Massachusetts are "taxpayer-funded." But that requirement long predated the law Romney signed. "That was already a given," Fox said. "Anything that’s paid for with tax money, like Medicaid, covered abortions." Her group was part of an effort to overturn that requirement with a constitutional amendment, but it failed. "The combination of the court order and state-controlled health care means Romney really wasn’t involved in funding these abortions. It was automatic, and there would be no way to stop it," Fox said. "We tried. It would have to be a constitutional amendment. It would not be something somebody could just veto." Fox’s assessment lines up with that of an abortion-rights group we contacted: "NARAL Pro-Choice America’s position is that the Massachusetts health care plan enacted during former Gov. Romney’s tenure expanded on a system that already covered abortion. Thus, Romney should not get credit for improving women's access to abortion in Massachusetts," spokesman Ted Miller said in an email. Our ruling Gingrich’s ad says "Romney signed government-mandated health care with taxpayer-funded abortions." What’s right about that? Romney did sign government-mandated health care, and Massachusetts does provide taxpayer-funded abortions. But the ad inaccurately links the two together. The law Romney signed did not mention abortion coverage. It was included by the state exchange, which created plans that mirror private insurance nationwide. And a court decision two decades earlier mandated that the cost of the abortions be included. You’d never know any of that based on the misleading wording in the ad. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-06533	Gains in Atlanta Public Schools scores on a national standardized test lend credence to "dramatic" score increases on state tests.	false	/georgia/statements/2011/oct/07/beverly-hall/former-aps-head-beverly-hall-says-national-test-pr/	Ever since Atlanta Public Schools’ cheating scandal began, then-Superintendent Beverly Hall has repeatedly pointed to a national test as proof that the changes she made produced real results: the National Assessment of Educational Progress. The NAEP is a top measure of student achievement, and APS’ NAEP scores improved under Hall’s term, Hall has said. One of her backers mentioned these scores in a New York Times article last month. Hall, herself, raised them Aug. 10 in a commentary published by the national trade publication Education Week. "The results of the standardized tests administered in 2010 and 2011 under this enhanced security have not been questioned -- and most important of all the dramatic improvement in test scores has remained. That improvement has also been confirmed by the National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP, which is independently administered," Hall wrote. "Dramatic" improvement in scores on the Criterion-Referenced Competency Tests has been "confirmed" by the NAEP? We decided to take a look. First, a brief aside. We checked Hall’s claim that CRCT tests scores for 2010 and 2011 "have not been questioned" and gave her a Pants on Fire. State investigators, the Governor’s Office for Student Achievement and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution questioned the validity of both years’ results. We asked Hall’s attorney for evidence backing her claim about the national test but received no response. After our inquiry, Council of Great City Schools Executive Director Michael Casserly repeated a similar claim Sept. 7 in The New York Times, but the story included no supporting evidence. Hall previously served on the board of Casserly’s organization. Now, the NAEP is different from your typical standardized test. Like the CRCT, it tests core subjects such as reading and mathematics, but many students don’t take it. Those who do don’t take all of it. They don’t even get their results. Instead, the NAEP randomly selects a representative sample of students to take the test. They take slices of the exam over a single day. Historically, the NAEP has been used to track student achievement at the state and national level. During the past decade, however, about a dozen large urban districts were recruited for a special trial to see how well the test evaluates district performance. APS joined the trial in 2002. The test was not the focus of the state’s CRCT investigation, and a federal review found no evidence of NAEP cheating, said Arnold Goldstein, who is program director for the assessment division of the National Center for Education Statistics, the division of the U.S. Department of Education that oversees the NAEP. The federal review’s findings were not published in a report, so PolitiFact Georgia could not examine its work. Experts agree that it’s much more difficult to cheat on the NAEP than the CRCTs, and they give the following reasons: -- NAEP test administrators are federal contract workers, not APS employees, so they have little incentive to cheat. Some are retired APS teachers, but a federal testing official told PolitiFact that they all worked as part of three-member teams with colleagues who had no ties to APS. -- NAEP test materials are not kept in schools overnight or during the weekend. That’s when much of the CRCT cheating took place, according to the state investigation. -- Students are tested on multiple subjects during the same NAEP test session. While one is working on a reading exam, another might be doing mathematics, so they can’t copy each others’ answers. But cheating is not out of the question. Sonny Perdue, who as governor launched the state investigation into the CRCT scores, is a member of the board that oversees the NAEP. He suggested at an August board meeting that there may be weaknesses in the system but did not give details. He declined through a spokesman to comment for this story. APS critics say the district might have tipped scores in its favor by withholding names of low-performing students from the roster the NAEP uses to select its test-takers. The NAEP doesn’t check student rosters by name. The procedure is to see whether the list it receives from a school matches up with the school’s overall characteristics, Goldstein said. The NAEP review found no problems, Goldstein said. But the federal review focused on whether APS followed standard procedures -- not whether the rosters were accurate. To comply with privacy policies, NAEP administrators routinely destroy the rosters schools send them, Goldstein said. Therefore, we think it may be impossible to check whether APS sent accurate lists. Now, let’s take a closer look at the NAEP results starting in 2002, which is when APS began participating in the urban district program. We found that even if you ignore the possibility of cheating, it’s not clear the gains are dramatic. APS previously trumpeted that since 2002, its students demonstrated the largest gains of other large urban school districts on the NAEP reading tests. This is correct, but since that time, APS’ demographics have shifted toward whites and Hispanics -- groups that generally score higher on the NAEP, experts noted. For instance, in 2002, 6 percent of APS fourth-graders were white and 3 percent were Hispanic. By 2009, the percentage of white students more than doubled to 13 percent. Hispanics increased to 5 percent. "I think that demographic changes in the fourth grade account for 40 percent or so of the progress, but that’s not something anybody wanted to talk about or even to point out," said Mark Musick, an East Tennessee State University professor who once was chairman of the board that directs the NAEP. Also, APS’ NAEP marks aren’t all improvements. The score gap between whites and blacks remains the second-largest in the nation among large districts. In addition, children in poverty now lag even further behind their peers in reading. Furthermore, Atlanta still trails well behind other large urban districts in crucial areas. For instance, Atlanta’s eighth grade 2009 mathematics scores were lower than all others but Cleveland, the District of Columbia and Los Angeles. And at current rates, it will take Atlanta 50 to 110 years for all its students to become proficient, said Binghamton University education professor Lawrence Stedman, who thinks that the cheating scandal is proof that the U.S. needs to scrap its approach to high-stakes testing. What gains APS made slowed in recent years, he said in a recent analysis of the district’s NAEP scores. Even if we take the NAEP gains at face value, it’s not accurate to say they support CRCT gains. Though student achievement rose according to both measures, NAEP gains don’t quite match up to CRCT increases, and demographic shifts might account for a portion of the increase. That said, it’s not clear we can take the NAEP scores at face value. While a federal review of APS procedures found no red flags, the bulk of the district’s cheating on the state CRCT exam only became public knowledge after a rigorous investigation that looked beyond procedures. Such an inquiry has not taken place on the NAEP. And even if it did, it may not ever be possible to ensure that APS sent accurate rosters to NAEP administrators. The NAEP destroyed its copies. Both the CRCT and NAEP registered some gains, but the causes are unclear, the results are mixed and the district’s integrity remains in question. So many questions remain unanswered that it makes little sense to conclude that NAEP scores confirm "dramatic" gains on the CRCT. Hall therefore earns a False.

pomt-01021	"When you look at the earned income tax credit, it has about a 25 percent fraud rate. We're looking at $20 billion to $30 billion."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/30/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-earned-income-tax-credit-has-25-per/	In what could be a prelude to the Republican presidential debate season, a handful of potential GOP contenders shared a stage at a recent conservative confab hosted by the deep-pocketed Koch brothers. Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas cordially sparred on a host of issues at the Freedom Partners retreat on Jan. 25. One area of division was about whether to expand the Earned Income Tax Credit. The program is designed to incentivize low-income individuals to work by giving them a tax refund (technically a refundable tax credit) on money that is earned. For the very poor, the refund increases the more money they make, which encourages more work. Expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit is one area where there’s some agreement between President Barack Obama and Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., the GOP’s go-to member for fiscal issues. But Rand Paul said Washington needed to pump the brakes on those proposals. "When you look at the earned income tax credit, it has about a 25 percent fraud rate," Paul said. "We're looking at $20 billion to $30 billion. And this is from estimates from the (Government Accountability Office), from the government themselves." We decided to check to see if Paul’s numbers add up. There are definitely problems with the Internal Revenue Service’s administration of the Earned Income Tax Credit, but they’re not all issues of fraud, as Paul claimed. In multiple reports, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration has dinged the IRS for failing to take steps to prevent improper payments. Since 2002, the IRS has been required to report estimates of improper payments to Congress. In that time, "the IRS has made little improvement in reducing improper Earned Income Tax Credit payments," the inspector general wrote in 2013. The Earned Income Tax Credit is the only IRS program that is considered a high-risk for improper payments, the inspector general said in 2014. At the root of the problem is the complex nature of the tax credit: It is available to only low-income individuals, and it fluctuates based on earnings, number of children and other factors. The churn into and out of the program is high — about one-third of all recipients are first-timers, or their eligibility changes year-to-year due to swings in their income. This creates confusion among both recipients and administrators. The IRS said it is difficult to balance reducing improper benefits with encouraging people who qualify to use the credit. How prevalent are these improper payments? According to the inspector general, 22 to 26 percent of all payments are improper. And how much does that cost taxpayers? The entire program totaled $63 billion in 2013, meaning improper payments ranged from $13.3 billion to $15.6 billion. So Paul’s percentage was right, but he overstated the actual annual cost. Paul’s statement, his spokesman Brian Darling said, also included another tax credit highlighted by the auditor’s 2014 report, the Additional Income Tax Credit, which similarly provides refunds for some working families with children. The inspector general found improper payments between $5.9 billion and $7 billion in 2013. Combined, improper payments from the two programs would likely top $20 billion. Not all improper payments, however, are "fraud," as Paul put it. There are six issues that have led to improper payments, one of which is fraud. But none of them "can be considered the primary driver of the (Earned Income Tax Credit) improper payments," the report said. Improper payments had two root causes: authentication and verification. For example, an authentication problem would be if a parent claims a child that doesn’t live with the parent most of the time. A verification problem would be if a person claims to have a lower income than they have. About 70 percent of improper payments are due to authentication problems. "The biggest source of error has to do with family status," said Eric Toder, co-director of the Tax Policy Center and former director of research at the IRS. "The size of the EITC has to do with how many kids you have, and the definition of ‘child’ means they’re living with you half the time. And in many low-income homes, kids go back and forth between one parent or another, and it’s not obvious who should be claiming the child, or they’re claiming the child they shouldn’t be." Of course, there are also ways to make mistakes filing income taxes under both scenarios. The IRS doesn’t keep track of how many improper payments are due to fraud and how many are due to human error. Paul’s spokesman said the distinction is negligible. "At a minimum it is a fraud on the taxpayer, because they are the source for improper payments," Darling said. Why have there habitually been issues stopping these improper payments? Unlike other federal assistance like food stamps, which require an in-person application process to weed out potential fraud, the tax credit is handled entirely by the tax system. Another issue is the typical benefit per family is small. The average payout is about $3,000. The IRS might prioritize more costly fraud instead of targeting small-time scofflaws, Toder said. Attempts have been made in the past to increase the number of auditors to target fraud among these populations, Toder added. Other policy changes have attempted to fix the error rate, to little success. Our ruling Paul said the earned income tax credit has a 25 percent "fraud rate" at a cost to taxpayers of $20 billion to $30 billion. There is a history of improper payments with the Earned Income Tax Credit that has not been resolved, for various reasons, since the IRS began reporting it in 2002. It’s listed as the only IRS program deemed to have a high risk of improper payments. But Paul’s characterization of the problem as "fraud" is way too specific. Not every improper payment constitutes fraud, and the exact percentage of fraud is not known. Also, the amount of improper payments is less than Paul said -- between $13.3 billion and $15.6 billion. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate the claim Half True.	None	Rand Paul	None	None	None	2015-01-30T13:27:58	2015-01-25	['None']
pomt-00336	Says there is a report "that showed that, should we move to cover more people to a Medicare for All system, we could actually save the system trillions over an extended period of time."	half-true	/florida/statements/2018/sep/18/andrew-gillum/fact-checking-andrew-gillum-cost-medicare-all/	Andrew Gillum, the Democratic nominee for Florida governor, has attracted national attention for his support for "Medicare for All," an idea to expand the government-run Medicare health insurance program to cover everyone, rather than just Americans 65 and over. Under the plan Gillum supports, individuals (and their employers) would no longer need to shoulder co-pays for medical care or premiums for private insurance coverage. Instead, the government would pay everyone’s medical bills. It's based on a bill sponsored by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. On CNN’s State of the Union, host Dana Bash asked Gillum about a George Mason University study that found Medicare for All could cost the government $33 trillion over 10 years. Bash asked whether Gillum be willing to tell Floridians they need to pay more in taxes to offset the costs. "Well, let me first say there was also a report, Dana, that showed that, should we move to cover more people to a Medicare for All system, we could actually save the system trillions over an extended period of time," Gillum said during the Sept. 2, 2018 interview. We confirmed with Gillum’s campaign that he and Bash were actually referring to the same report — one published by the free-market-oriented Mercatus Center at George Mason University. Both sides in the Medicare for All debate have seized upon aspects of the report to bolster their arguments. Critics, including the author of the report, emphasized that the policy would bring a substantial fiscal burden. But supporters found fiscal hope. When Sanders previously said that the study indicated that enacting Medicare for All "would save the American people $2 trillion over a 10-year period," we rated that claim Half True. We thought that the issue was worth a fresh look with Gillum's defense, especially given some slight differences in his phrasing. The Mercatus study Medicare for All supporters say the proposal would not only increase health-insurance coverage to 100 percent but that the government could actually save money. The savings, they say, would come from eliminating the profits currently generated by health insurers, from taking advantage of economies of scale, and from being able to leverage lower prices on everything from prescription drugs to physician reimbursement fees. Critics are skeptical that such savings would materialize, leaving taxpayers on the hook if they don't. They also worry about other negative consequences, such as mass retirements of doctors unwilling to accept lower fees. To settle this debate, Medicare for All supporters flip to the page in the Mercatus report summarizing the financial effects of Sanders’ bill. The researchers looked at two main scenarios after implementation of the proposal. One compared Mercatus’ projection for the Sanders Medicare for All bill with what would be expected under a continuation of the current system (according to a Department of Health and Human Services’ projection). With Medicare for All, the total amount of health care expenditures nationally would fall by $2.054 trillion over 10 years compared to the current system. So Gillum can point to some evidence in the study that predicts savings. However, the Mercatus report’s author, Charles Blahous, criticized that takeaway. In an August interview with PolitiFact, Blahous said that estimate is based on a relatively generous assumption about how well Sanders’ plan will end up controlling health care costs. It assumes that provider payments will be reduced to Medicare levels, that negotiation with prescription drugmakers will generate significant savings, and that administrative costs will be cut from 13 to 6 percent. Blahous was more confident about an alternative scenario published in the report, in which cost-control works less effectively. Mercatus found that over the same 10-year period, national health expenditures would actually increase by $3.252 trillion compared to current law. In addition, even if the switch to Medicare for All does end up cutting the total amount of money spent on health care in the United States, the legislation places more of those costs on the federal budget. In an era of rising debt and an aging Baby Boom generation, that could be a problem. The role of uncertainty In other words, there are a range of possible outcomes if Medicare for All is enacted, some supportive of Gillum’s perspective and some not. Independent health policy experts express caution before assuming large savings. Sustained cuts as deep as those projected in the Mercatus model that Gillum likes are "not likely feasible," John Holahan, a fellow in the health policy center at the Urban Institute, told us in August. His Urban Institute colleague, Linda Blumberg, agreed, saying it’s a "pretty heroic assumption to say that you can dial payment rates down to those levels system-wide politically." Christine Eibner, a health policy analyst with the RAND Corp., said that uncertainty makes it hard to predict the cost impact of Medicare for All, including whether administrative costs and reimbursements would decline or whether demand for health care services could be kept in check. In a recent report co-authored by Eibner that considered the impact of a single-payer model for New York state, RAND found that "the estimated effects are highly dependent on the assumptions about provider payment rates, administrative costs, and drug prices." Our ruling Gillum said there is a report "that showed that, should we move to cover more people to a Medicare for All system, we could actually save the system trillions over an extended period of time." Trillions in savings would be one of a range of possibilities for how Medicare for All enactment could play out. But it’s not the only one, and independent analysts say it’s far from a sure thing that Medicare for All would save as much money as Gillum hopes it will. The statement is partially accurate. We rate it Half True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Andrew Gillum	None	None	None	2018-09-18T11:43:40	2018-09-02	['None']
pomt-02043	Says Gov. Scott Walker "has made Wisconsin 2nd in the nation in losing jobs."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jun/02/brett-hulsey/brett-hulsey-says-scott-walker-has-made-wisconsin-/	It’s well known that Gov. Scott Walker has faltered on his top 2010 campaign promise of creating 250,000 private-sector jobs in his first term. With his re-election looming in November 2014, he’s less than halfway there. So when state Rep. Brett Hulsey announced he was running in the Democratic primary to challenge Walker, it would seem he had an easy issue to raise. But even when running a shoestring campaign, those shoestrings can trip you up. In an April 30, 2014 news release -- issued at a time when the state GOP was poised to vote on a resolution proclaiming the right to secede from the United States -- Hulsey declared: "Governor Walker’s Reign of Error has made Wisconsin 2nd in the nation in losing jobs. To create a better future for our children, we should strive to be the best in the United States, not leave it." As evidence of his jobs claim, Hulsey cited a March 30, 2014 article from The Capital Times that discussed the Bureau of Labor Statistics monthly jobs report for February of 2014. That report said Wisconsin lost an estimated 9,500 jobs in February. Only North Carolina at 11,300 was worst; Alaska at 2,300 placed third. (These figures include both private-sector and government jobs. Walker’s campaign promise focused only on private sector jobs.) So, at least in terms of the February report, Hulsey’s claim was on point. But the jobs count cited in the article was based on monthly numbers, which are derived from a small sample of employers and often subject to dramatic changes. And Hulsey did not specify a month in his claim. Rather, he expressed it as a current condition. Indeed, by the time Hulsey made his statement the estimates for March were already out, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics had also revised the February figures. Two things in those numbers stand out: -- Wisconsin’s jobs number for February actually worsened with the revision, and the state fell behind North Carolina to the top, er, bottom spot. -- But the March figures said the state added 6,900 jobs in March. As for the No. 2 loser title, that month it belonged to Virginia (-5,000) which followed Pennsylvania (-8,400) By either measure, Hulsey was wrong -- in one case slightly so, in the other wildly so. Our rating Hulsey said Walker "has made Wisconsin 2nd in the nation in losing jobs." He cherry-picked a report for a single month but spoke of it as a longer-term trend. What’s more, the data was already outdated at the time, so he was wrong when he said it. We rate his statement False.

pomt-11977	California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom was "for (high-speed rail), before he’s against it, and then he’s for it again."	mostly true	/california/statements/2017/sep/29/antonio-villaraigosa/has-gavin-newsom-flip-flopped-californias-high-spe/	High-speed rail has wedged itself into the 2018 campaign for California governor, splitting the current top two Democrats in the race. Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa recently claimed Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom — the frontrunner in the race — has essentially flip-flopped in his support for the state’s controversial and costly rail project. Here’s what Villaraigosa told the Sacramento Bee on Sept. 20, 2017: Newsom was "for it, before he’s against it, and then he’s for it again." He added that Newsom was revising his positions "when the winds blow in his direction." Given the key decisions California’s next governor will need to make on high-speed rail, we wanted to know whether Newsom has really shifted this much in his support for the massive project. We hopped aboard for a fact-check. Background on the bullet train In 2008, California voters approved a nearly $10 billion bond to jump-start the development of a high-speed rail network. Plans called for trains to zip across the state at 200 miles per hour, initially connecting San Francisco to Los Angeles and eventually extending the system to Sacramento and San Diego. Cost estimates for the project, however, have see-sawed from an initial $33 billion to $98 billion to $64 billion. The project has also fallen far behind schedule with construction limited to a small segment in the Central Valley. We asked Villaraigosa’s campaign for evidence of Newsom’s shifting positions. As examples of his initial support, it pointed to news articles showing Newsom backing the 2008 bond measure. The campaign then cited a 2014 radio interview that it says proves Newsom opposed the project. Finally, it cited articles from October 2016 in which the lieutenant governor again pledged his support. "We absolutely need this," Newsom said of high-speed rail in a 2007 Mercury-News article. In February 2014, however, Newsom was asked by conservative radio host Ben Shapiro: "Are you pro or against the train, especially now that the California public, which approved the train in the first place, has reneged and no longer likes the train?" Newsom responded: "I think I’m where the public was and is." A poll in September 2013 found 52 percent of Californians wanted the rail project stopped and 51 percent felt it was a waste of money. Newsom went on to tell Shapiro:"We don’t have the federal dollars we were hoping for ... the private sector hasn’t stepped up." Shapiro then asked: "If you had your druthers, Gavin, would you kill the thing?" Newsom responded: "I would take the dollars and redirect it to other, more pressing infrastructure needs. … I am not the only Democrat that feels this way. I gotta tell you, I am one of the few that just said it publicly. Most are now saying it privately." This exchange gave many the impression Newsom had backed away from the project. Newsom did not clarify in the interview what kind of funds should be redirected. In October 2016, Newsom told the Sacramento Press Club that he would "100 percent" seek a solid funding source for the train project if he's elected governor in 2018. The Associated Press took that to mean he again supported the project. A March 2017 poll found Californians remain divided over high-speed rail, with 48 percent favoring the project and 46 percent opposed. The survey added that 66 percent say they would favor high-speed rail if it cost less than the current estimate of $64 billion over the next 20 years. In this Feb. 26, 2016, file photo, the supports for a 1,600-foot-viaduct to carry high-speed rail trains across the Fresno River are seen under construction near Madera, Calif. (AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli, File) Newsom’s response Dan Newman, Newsom’s campaign spokesman, described Villaraigosa’s claim about shifting positions this way: "The statement is extremely misleading at best," he said in an email. "Villaraigosa is simply trying to score political points with a disingenuous cheap shot, by blithely ignoring the fact that the project being discussed today is significantly different than what voters supported in 2008." The spokesman said Newsom has "never opposed" high-speed rail. Instead, Newsom publicly scrutinized the project’s business plan when cost estimates ballooned to nearly $100 billion and questioned Gov. Jerry Brown’s plans to use cap and trade funds for it, the spokesman said. "Scrutinizing the business plan is very different from opposing (high-speed rail)," Newman added. He said Newsom’s comment in the 2014 radio interview about redirecting money away from the project was referring to redirecting cap and trade money away from it, not the state bond money passed by voters. He said a statement from Newsom’s office in March 2014 clarifies Newsom’s consistent support even as he questioned the project’s finances: "The lieutenant governor has long supported high speed rail and still does, but this project in its current form gives him pause," Newsom’s spokeswoman Andrea Koskey, told Buzzfeed News for an article on March 27, 2014. He added that Newsom’s statements of support in more recent years are also consistent with previous comments. Experts we spoke with were split on the claim. Sacramento State Political Science Professor Wesley Hussey said Villaraigosa’s claim about Newsom vacillating on the project isn’t right. "I don't think it's a fair assessment," the professor said in an email."Newsom came out several years ago with serious doubts about the high speed rail, but I don't think he's ever said definitely he would stop the program if he became governor. Maybe he fluctuates from lukewarm to a soft no, but that's not the same as consistently changing his opinion." Key to our assessment, however, was the 2014 radio interview and Newsom’s own admission that he agreed with the growing public sentiment that opposed the train at that time. We spoke with one more expert. Lou Thompson is chairman of the California High-Speed Rail Peer Review Group, an independent oversight group that issues reports to the Legislature on the project. He declined to comment about whether he believed Newsom had definitely switched his stance on high speed rail. Thompson said, however, that redirecting cap and trade money away from the project in 2014, as Newsom suggested doing, would have made the project’s future "a lot more difficult." Asked whether such a move would have effectively killed the project, Thompson said: "I don’t know what other source of money they would have found." He described cap and trade money as the key revenue source for the project both then and now, given the restrictions on other sources, including the bond funds. Our rating Villaraigosa claimed Newsom has essentially flip-flopped in his support for California’s high-speed rail, saying he was "for it, before he’s against it, and then he’s for it again." Villaraigosa’s campaign cited articles showing Newsom strongly backed the project a decade ago. It also pointed to a radio interview in 2014 in which Newsom admitted that he shared the public’s growing opposition to high-speed rail. He also suggested redirecting funds away from the project, a move that the head of the project’s oversight panel said would have made building high-speed rail "a lot more difficult." A spokesman for Newsom’s campaign defended the candidate’s stance, saying Newsom has scrutinized project costs as they have soared beyond initial estimates. He said, however, that Newsom has never turned his back on high-speed rail. We found Villaraigosa pointed to key evidence, particularly the 2014 radio interview, that shows Newsom’s stance had shifted, at least for that moment in time. In fairness to Newsom, he’s consistently expressed concern that the project no longer represents what voters supported in 2008 and that his main worry was its cost. Villaraigosa’s statement could have used this additional information. We rate his claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-12165	"Hillary Clinton has third heart attack — docs says she ‘won’t survive’."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/aug/03/blog-posting/hillary-clinton-not-dead-heart-attack-fake-news-si/	An online story about former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton suffering not just one heart attack, but three, is a fake news story concocted by a parody site run by a liberal troll. "Breaking: Hillary Clinton has third heart attack — docs says she ‘won’t survive’," read the headline on a July 28, 2017, post on PoliticsPaper.com. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to combat fake news. The article called Clinton the "Butcher of Benghazi" and quoted Dr. Eugene Icsa of Westchester Memorial Hospital in upstate New York as saying, "We predict she’ll be at rest within hours." The story further said daughter Chelsea was visiting, but husband and former President Bill Clinton was "sitting on the front porch of the Chappaqua mansion drinking what looks like either tomato juice or a Bloody Mary." There have been no other reports of Hillary Clinton suffering a massive coronary episode; it’s because she hasn’t. The story is fake. The photo ostensibly of a doctor feverishly working to save Clinton’s life is actually a stock photo we most recently found on a Seattle Times story about the challenges facing trauma nurses. There’s not even a Westchester Memorial Hospital in upstate New York, as far as we can tell. There is a Westchester Medical Center in Westchester, N.Y., but that’s it. This item was originally posted on July 22 on TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a website run by a man named Christopher Blair, who creates absurd news stories in an attempt to fool conservative readers. A footnote on the bottom of the website said that "everything on this site is a satirical work of fiction." The warning is repeated in the About Us section, where a disclaimer reads, "We present fiction as fact and our sources don’t actually exist." This site and its troll-run brethren like to write about Clinton’s death quite a bit. OurLandOfTheFree.com, a related website, wrote on July 13 that Clinton died of an overdose of Dilaudid, which is a brand-name of the opioid painkiller hydromorphone. TheLastLineOfDefense.org also ran a series of stories in which Hillary and Chelsea Clinton died in a boating accident that was the result of sabotage. Clinton is still very much in the news, since Republican members of Congress continue to push for investigations into her own campaign activities. But she’s still alive.

pomt-13674	Trade deals threaten "India’s role as the pharmacy of the developing world" for new HIV medicines.	mostly true	/global-news/statements/2016/aug/03/doctors-without-borders/do-trade-deals-threaten-india-low-cost-hiv-drug-ma/	If there was one success story to emerge from the International AIDS Conference in Durban, South Africa, it was that more people are getting treated for HIV/AIDS than ever before -- about 17 million by the latest United Nations estimate. Falling drug prices played a key role in helping providers reach this point. But the international health group Doctors Without Borders (Médecins Sans Frontières) warned at a press conference that trade negotiations around the world put future gains at risk. The group said its latest report "examines multiple global threats to access to affordable treatment, including trade deals which threaten India’s role as the ‘pharmacy of the developing world.’" Trade is at the center of the U.S. presidential election for its effect on the American work force. But is there more at play? We wondered if it’s true that the next round of agreements, both those that involve the United States and those that don’t, would undermine some large drug makers in India. Why India India matters because thanks to the country’s patent laws, India and generics go together like toast and jam. The rules there make it easier than other places for companies to churn out generic drugs once the patent on the original version runs out. Generics are cheaper than their brand name cousins and if you want to stretch a dollar, you take the generic option. Doctors Without Borders said 97 percent of the drugs it uses to treat people with HIV are generics made in India. That includes medicines for HIV itself, as well as for diseases like pneumonia and tuberculosis that hit people with suppressed immune systems. Doctors Without Borders is worried less about the drugs it uses today and more about the ones it’s counting on in the future. As the number of people coming in for treatment rises, doctors are finding more who don’t respond to the most common, or first-line, medications. Doctors Without Borders is focused on making second-and-third-line drugs more affordable to keep pace with a growing need, and they see India as the place to make that happen. Impact of trade deals Although the Trans-Pacific Partnership gets a lot of attention in the United States, India is not part of it. But it is part of discussions involving the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a mega-regional pact that aims to tie together 16 countries including China, India, Australia, Japan, South Korea and many other Asian nations. The European Union is also seeking a regional trade agreement with India and other Asian countries. Both of those trade negotiations have sought to get India to tighten its patent laws. The United States has too, through a one-on-one process overseen by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. The issues that office has raised mirror ones in the big trade deals. The USTR’s latest report criticizes India’s patent laws, saying "the pharmaceutical industry in particular faces a host of challenges related to intellectual property rights." What do U.S. trade negotiators not like in particular? For one, India is reluctant to grant new patents for a drug or blend of drugs built around medications that already enjoy patent protection. These so-called secondary patents extend the time for the drug maker to enjoy exclusive production rights. That translates into a chance to charge higher prices. American officials also don’t care for India’s rules on clinical trial information. When someone invents a drug, they have to prove it’s safe and effective. That proof is in the trial reports. India lets generic drug makers rely on the original clinical trials. One way to extend the exclusive right to make a drug is to bar generic drug makers from using that data for a number of years. Would these sorts of changes make life easier for the makers of new drugs and harder for the generic manufacturers? We found no dispute that they would. We talked with independent experts who think India should stand its ground and those who thought it ought to bend, but either way, they agreed on who wins and who loses. There are good arguments on both sides for protecting the profits of companies that invent new drugs, versus making drugs more affordable. We take no position on the larger question of where the right balance point falls. We're focused only on the claim that large trading partners want to move Indian law in favor of the inventors of new drugs. Lee Branstetter is a professor and trade specialist at Carnegie Mellon University. He thinks Indian law ought to change at the expense of the generic companies. "In the short run, this will constrain the profit opportunities for the generic producers," he told us. Srividhya Ragavan, a professor of law at Texas A&M, thinks India’s laws strike the right balance as they are. She told us she sees the U.S. position as "an effort to weaken India’s generic drug industry." We found any number of articles that reached the same conclusion. But just because Branstetter and Ragavan see eye to eye on how these policy shifts would undermine generic drug makers, that doesn't mean they agree on what this means for the availability of low-cost drugs. Ragavan told us "the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership and EU’s trade negotiations, are all targeting India’s generic drug industry much to the detriment of access to medication to the poor people." Branstetter said that’s unlikely and highlights an important feature in the overarching trade rules of the World Trade Organization. The escape hatch Branstetter said based on what he’s seen in other countries (he cited Peru as an example) he doubts that would happen. But even if it did, he said, a part of the WTO code -- the Doha Declaration on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Agreement -- gives countries the chance to override a patent that limits a drug’s availability. Branstetter calls it an escape hatch. "Any member state could declare we have a public health emergency," Branstetter said. "Then, they can force the company that holds the patent to licence the manufacture of that drug to a domestic or foreign drug producer, who would provide it at an agreed price." Branstetter notes that the Trans-Pacific Partnership specifically requires any country that signs it to accept that Doha declaration. Countries have taken this step before. At the height of the AIDS crisis in the mid 2000s, Indonesia, Malaysia, Ghana, Mozambique and many others issued what are called compulsory licenses to get affordable HIV/AIDS drugs to their citizens. Still, Rohit Malpani, director of policy of the Doctors Without Borders- Access Campaign, told us that in recent years, the number of compulsory licenses has fallen off. "Even if countries have the right to use the safeguard and can use them they do not," Malpani said. He suggested several reasons, including a lack of political will and pressure from the United States, the EU and the drug companies. Our ruling Doctors Without Borders said that trade deals threaten the capacity of Indian generic drug makers to produce the next round of HIV drugs. We found that trade negotiations, whether part of large regional trade agreements or unilateral discussions between the United States and India, have language that work against India generic drug makers. They push India to be more ready to grant patents for drugs that are extensions of drugs that already enjoy patent protection. And they want India to bar generic drug makers from relying on the clinical trial data produced by the inventor of the drug. Both measures would make patents last longer and give the drug companies more time to charge higher prices. None of the articles we read or experts we reached doubted this result or that this would undermine the generic drug makers. Our experts disagreed on whether this would reduce access to critical drugs. The trade deals do no favors for India’s generic drug makers. With a caveat about future access to drugs, we rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Doctors Without Borders	None	None	None	2016-08-03T11:24:05	2016-07-21	['India']
pomt-03325	"Most of the U.S. Senate is comprised of multimillionaires."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/jul/25/sheila-oliver/sheila-oliver-says-us-senate-mostly-made-multi-mil/	Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver says the U.S. Senate doesn’t look enough like the rest of America. It’s mostly just a bunch of multimillionaires, the Essex County Democrat claims. As one of four candidates in the Aug. 13 Democratic primary to fill the U.S. Senate seat previously held by the late Frank Lautenberg, Oliver has presented herself to voters as a hard-working individual from humble beginnings. Oliver is competing against Newark Mayor Cory Booker and Congressmen Rush Holt and Frank Pallone. "Many of our senators have not lived the life of an average working-class person," Oliver said in a July 11 interview on NJToday. "Most of the U.S. Senate is comprised of multimillionaires." For the most part, Oliver’s claim is on the money. Most current senators had an average net worth in 2011 of more than $1 million, but less than a majority were "multimillionaires" with several million dollars, according to an analysis of financial disclosure forms by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. The Washington, D.C.-based center’s analysis is based on financial disclosure forms filed by members of Congress when they were already in office or running as candidates last year. After subtracting the liabilities from the assets, the center estimates a range of net worth. The most recent data available on the center’s website covers 2011 and includes 98 of the 100 current senators. Only Sen. Jeff Chiesa of New Jersey -- who was appointed as an interim replacement for Lautenberg -- and Brian Schatz of Hawaii are not included in the database of personal finances for 2011. Of those 98 current senators, 62 had an average net worth of more than $1 million, according to the center. Among those 62 senators, 13 had between $1 million and $2 million; 6 had between $2 million and $3 million; and 43 senators had more than $3 million, the center states. Based on those 2011 figures, the wealthiest senator was Mark Warner of Virginia, who had an average net worth of slightly more than $228 million, according to the center. The poorest senator was Florida’s Marco Rubio with negative $45,494 in average net worth, the center states. The annual salary for most senators is $174,000. Senate leaders earn $193,400 per year. Since less than a majority of senators had an average net worth of several million dollars in 2011, Oliver’s claim about "multimillionaires" is slightly off. Still, most senators at least had more than $1 million. In response to our findings, Oliver spokesman Michael Makarski made the following statement: "Speaker Oliver was making the point that average working and middle class people are underrepresented, and that Congress and Washington in general are out of touch with mainstream Americans." Some political science experts said the number of millionaires in the Senate is related to the expense of running a Senate campaign and the prestige of being a senator. "The Senate is the big boy's and big girl's...sandbox," Ross Baker, a political science professor at Rutgers University, said in an e-mail. "You get all your calls returned." Richard Arenberg of Brown University’s Taubman Center for Public Policy and American Institutions, who worked on Capitol Hill for about 34 years, also noted how wealthier individuals are more likely able to meet the demands of running for Senate and maintaining the office. "My theory would be that it is a challenge to live the lifestyle expected of a senator, including maintaining homes in Washington and their home states, if the senator is living solely on a senator's salary," Arenberg said in an e-mail. "The campaign demands also play a role in the sense that a campaign for the Senate these days takes a fulltime commitment for up to two years," Arenberg added. "Many people cannot break from their careers and make the financial sacrifice to do that." Our ruling In an NJToday interview, Oliver claimed: "Most of the U.S. Senate is comprised of multimillionaires." Based on financial data analyzed by the Center for Responsive Politics, 62 current senators had an average net worth in 2011 of more than $1 million. Of those senators, 13 had between $1 million and $2 million; 6 had between $2 million and $3 million; and 43 senators had more than $3 million. We rate the statement Mostly True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com. Editor's Note: After this story was published, we learned that Massachusetts Sen. Edward Markey is included in the database of personal finances for 2011 as a congressman. We have revised the story to show that 62 senators had an average net worth in 2011 of more than $1 million.

pomt-11034	"Our courts find that 80 percent of those who do file for asylum aren’t qualified for it, do not merit that relief."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/02/jeff-sessions/jeff-sesssions-false-claim-80-percent-asylum-appli/	Attorney General Jeff Sessions defended the Trump administration’s "zero-tolerance" policy to prosecute all immigrants who enter the United States illegally, saying not prosecuting them would be a "disservice" to the country and an "insult" to those who come to the United States legally. Sessions said "adults are only being arrested" because they didn’t come to the United States through a port of entry "where they could have applied for asylum lawfully." (That’s not accurate. Immigrants can apply for asylum even if apprehended at the border, regardless of immigration status.) "But many do not apply for asylum, of course" Sessions said June 25 before the National Association of School Resource Officers. "And our courts find that 80 percent of those who do file for asylum aren’t qualified for it, do not merit that relief." Is Sessions accurate that 80 percent of immigrants who apply for asylum "do not merit the relief"? We asked the Justice Department about Sessions’ claim, pointing to Sessions’ prepared remarks posted on the department’s website saying: "courts find that 80 percent of asylum claims are without merit." In fiscal year 2017 there was a 20 percent grant rate for asylum applications, "which suggests that most are not meritorious," Justice Department spokesman Devin M. O’Malley told PolitiFact. But experts told us it’s not that clear cut that the remaining 80 percent of asylum applications are not merited. There are several other reasons why an asylum claim is not granted, experts told us. Here’s a closer look at the issue. Asylum data The Justice Department pointed to immigration court statistics, particularly a table on asylum rates for the latest full fiscal year, 2017. A footnote for that table said the data is for asylum decisions on affirmative and defensive applications issued in completed removal, deportation, exclusion, and asylum-only proceedings. ("Affirmative asylum" is filed voluntarily with Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services; if USCIS is unable to approve a case, the agency may refer it to immigration court within the Justice Department. "Defensive asylum" applications go before an immigration judge and are filed by individuals who are in removal proceedings.) Here’s what the 2017 asylum rates said: • Grant rate: 20.22 percent • Denial rate: 33.51 percent • Other closure rate: 27.66 percent • Administrative closure rate: 18.61 percent The "other" rate is for cases that have a decision of abandonment, not adjudicated, other, or withdrawn. The administrative closure rate covers "decisions that have not been placed back on the docket following a granted motion to recalendar," the footnote for the table said. Just because the grant rate is about 20 percent, it does not mean that an 80 percent aren’t qualified, or don’t merit relief, as Sessions claimed. As the Justice Department table showed, there are several other factors at play. It’s also worth noting that the data the Justice Department highlighted includes "affirmative asylum" cases, which initiate with USCIS and are referred to immigration court. Affirmative asylum applicants are not in removal proceedings, as would be people apprehended at the border due to the "zero-tolerance" policy. Denise Gilman, a clinical professor and director of the Immigration Clinic at the University of Texas School of Law, pointed to other data released in the Justice Department’s fiscal year 2016 statistics yearbook. It showed a 31 percent grant rate in 2016 for defensive asylum claims. Border claims would fall into that pile (along with some others), Gilman said. Experts weigh in Immigration law experts told us that some asylum cases can also be denied while still having viable claims. It is not accurate to infer that because only 20 percent of claims were granted that the rest were not meritorious, said Jennifer Gordon, a law professor at Fordham Law School. "Many cases are denied for procedural reasons not related to the merit of the claim, or because the applicants are unrepresented or poorly represented and therefore don't have the chance to make their case in an effective way," Gordon said. She also said that cases decided by asylum officers are not counted in the immigration court statistics. Access to counsel significantly impacts the outcome of a case, said Lori A. Nessel, a law professor and director of Seton Hall University School of Law's Center for Social Justice. "When asylum-seekers are detained, they are much less likely to have lawyers and without lawyers, they are less likely to even seek asylum or other relief, much less be granted," Nessel said. Immigrants, including asylum applicants, also do fare better in some courts than in others, said Stephen Meili, associate professor of law at the University of Minnesota Law School. An October 2017 story published on NJ.com noted disparities in outcome of cases, with immigrants faring better in courts in Newark, N.J. than in Atlanta. Greater access to lawyers in the Newark and New York area could determine success in courts, the story said. In discussing merit, it's also important to count the number of cases that are reversed by the board of immigration appeals or by one of the circuit courts of appeals, said James Hathaway, a law professor and director of the Program in Refugee and Asylum Law at the University of Michigan Law School. Our ruling Sessions said, "Our courts find that 80 percent of those who do file for asylum aren’t qualified for it, do not merit that relief." Sessions’ claim is based on Justice Department data showing a 20 percent asylum grant rate in 2017. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that the remaining 80 percent were without merit. The data the Justice Department used to support Sessions’ remark actually undercut his point. Some cases had not been adjudicated or placed in the court docket. Immigration law experts also said that even if a case is denied, it could still be meritorious, but unsuccessful in court because an applicant did not have a lawyer. Sessions’ claim is not accurate. We rate it False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Jeff Sessions	None	None	None	2018-07-02T08:00:00	2018-06-25	['None']
pomt-13879	"As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton laundered money to Bill Clinton through Laureate Education, while Bill Clinton was an honorary chairman of the group."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/01/donald-trump/did-hillary-clinton-launder-millions-dollars-while/	Donald Trump assailed Hillary Clinton’s credibility in a rapid response email following her speech on economics on June 21. Trump claimed that Clinton used her role as secretary of state as a vehicle to funnel government money to her husband. "As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton laundered money to Bill Clinton through Laureate Education, while Bill Clinton was an honorary chairman of the group," the email said. "Clinton's State Department provided $55.2 million in grants to Laureate Education from 2010-2012. Laureate thanked Bill for providing unbelievable access to the secretary of state by paying him off $16.5 million. This is yet another example of how Clinton treated the State Department as her own personal hedge fund, and sold out the American public to fund her lavish lifestyle." Laureate Education is a network of more than 80 for-profit educational institutions that operate in 30 countries. Bill Clinton was named Laureate’s honorary chancellor in 2010 and maintained this position until 2015. His role chiefly consisted of advising the company on educational matters and traveling to campuses across the world to speak to young people. The Trump campaign did not respond to our requests for clarification, but his argument seems to be based off of claims made in Peter Schweizer’s book Clinton Cash. In the book, Schweizer describes what he calls the "Clinton blur" between the activities of Bill and Hillary Clinton, the State Department and associated nonprofits and corporations. We decided to investigate Trump’s claim that Hillary Clinton, who was secretary from 2009 through early 2013, "laundered" money to Laureate to pay off her husband’s salary. We ultimately found that there is zero evidence that Laureate received any money from the federal government while Clinton was at the State Department. Bill Clinton and Laureate Education Neither Bill Clinton nor Laureate Education disclosed his compensation as honorary chancellor. However, his tax returns show that Laureate paid him approximately $16.5 million between 2010 and 2014. We looked to usaspending.gov to find out if Laureate received any funding from the State Department. The site tracks the amount of money given to various organizations through government grants and contracts. According to this database, Laureate did not receive any money from any federal agency while Bill Clinton was in his role, nor while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. State Department Spokesperson John Kirby said in a statement, "The State Department is not aware of any grants provided directly to Laureate Education since 2009, though we are aware of some grants to educational institutions within or affiliated with the Laureate Education network." The International Youth Foundation Clinton Cash draws a connection between Laureate Education and the International Youth Foundation, a nonprofit that supports youth employment, entrepreneurship and social innovation across the world. The book notes that Laureate Chairman Douglas Becker is also chairman of the foundation’s board of directors. The foundation’s profile on usaspending.gov shows that it received approximately $72.6 million in grants between fiscal years 2009 and 2013. Trump gets to his $55.2 million figure by summing the grant money received between 2010 and 2012. We looked at the grant money given to the International Youth Foundation by the government between 2009 and 2013. FY 2009: $9M from USAID FY 2010: $17M from USAID FY 2011: $14.6M from USAID FY 2012: $23.6M from USAID. $1.9 million from State Department. FY 2013: $10.4M from USAID The grant money shown on usaspending.gov appears to have sharply increased while Hillary Clinton was at the State Department, which is the gist of the claim that Trump’s source makes. However, he fails to mention several key facts that undermine the logic of his claim. First, the International Youth Foundation had been receiving similar amounts of grant money before Hillary Clinton joined the State Department. An open letter by CEO William Reese claims that they negotiated a grant in 2008 under President George W. Bush for $30.2 million for a USAID mission in Jordan. He says that the money from this grant was handed out over several years, overlapping with new grants from President Barack Obama, giving the false impression that funding had sharply increased after Clinton became secretary of state. We looked at financial records provided by the foundation and confirmed the existence and size of the grants. The records show that approximately $24 million from the grant was dispensed between 2010 and 2012. Second, almost all of the grants came from USAID, which is a separate agency than the State Department. Is it possible that Hillary Clinton had influence over the USAID grant process while she was secretary of state? A State Department spokesperson told us the two agencies have separate grant and contract offices, separate procurement offices and their own rules with regards to the grant process. "State would not have oversight of or be involved in the USAID grant process — grants are let through a competitive process that the agency itself undertakes," said Jennifer Kates, vice president and director of Global Health & HIV Policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, who is familiar with the agencies’ grant processes. Finally, there is no evidence to indicate that the International Youth Foundation is a sister organization of Laureate that could be used to transfer money to the company. Schweizer points to Douglas Becker to imply that the organizations are linked. However, Becker isn’t paid for his position at the foundation and has no official executive role. In an interview with PolitiFact, Reese of the International Youth Foundation expanded on their relationship with Laureate. "If we were a subordinate organization we would have to state that in our 990. If we were to transfer money over to Laureate we would have to put that," Reese said. "We’ve received money from Laureate but never given money to them." Reese stated that the two organizations have worked together on a variety of projects related to global development in the past, such as a relief project for the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. The foundation’s records show that it’s been receiving between $100,000 and $1.4 million per year from Laureate since 2003, seven years before Bill Clinton joined Laureate. When we asked about any relationship Bill Clinton had with the International Youth Foundation, Reese said, "No contractual or employment or consulting agreements have been made with President Clinton." The foundation’s profile on Charitynavigator.org, a site that ranks nonprofits according to transparency and accountability, shows that it’s a respected charity with a score of 94.26 out of 100 possible points. The foundation has worked with various other high-profile partners such as Nokia and Barclays since 1990. Our ruling Trump said Hillary Clinton "laundered money to Bill Clinton through Laureate Education, while Bill Clinton was an honorary chairman of the group." That's a serious of charge of illegal activity. Actually, the State Department under Clinton never made any direct transfers to Laureate Education. Trump’s source conflates Laureate with a separate charitable organization that received funds from a separate government agency. The International Youth Foundation is a respected nonprofit that has received money from the government since the Bush years, before Clinton joined the State Department. We rate this claim False.

pomt-15182	"The rate in which people are working (in Wisconsin) is almost five points higher than it is nationally."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/aug/21/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-wisconsin-percentage-people-work/	Gov. Scott Walker took a new approach when asked about his jobs record during the first GOP presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015. Fox News anchor Chris Wallace reminded viewers that Walker promised in 2010 that state employers would create 250,000 jobs in his first four-year term. "In fact, Wisconsin added barely half that and ranked 35th in the country in job growth," Wallace said, addressing Walker. "Now you're running for president, and you're promising an economic plan in which everyone will earn a piece of the American dream," he said. "Given your record in Wisconsin, why should voters believe you?" Walker responded that the state’s unemployment rate has declined from more than 8 percent in the depths of the Great Recession to 4.6 percent, and that the state had "more than made up for the jobs that were lost during the recession." Then he turned to the claim we want to check: "And the rate in which people are working is almost five points higher than it is nationally." Is he right? And is that something new under Walker? About the statistic Walker’s campaign said he was referring to the Labor Force Participation Rate, a measuring stick created by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The participation rate includes "the number of people who are either employed or are actively looking for work," according to Investopedia.com. It does not include those who are no longer actively searching for work. It’s a different vantage point than the more typically used unemployment rate. As of June 2015, the state’s rate was 67.9 percent. That compares with the national rate of 62.6 percent. Thus, Wisconsin’s rate is about 5.3 percentage points higher than the national one. So, Walker is correct on the number. (A note: the national figures come from a different set of data, the Current Population Survey, while the state figures are from the Local Area Unemployment Statistics.) The history behind the numbers But, a deeper look shows that the state’s performance predates his time in office. That is, Wisconsin’s labor force participation has exceeded the nation’s for years. For instance, in 2010 -- the year before Walker took office -- the state’s participation rate was 63.4 percent, compared with 58.5 percent nationally. That was a difference of 4.9 points, at a time when the economy was just beginning to emerge from the recession. Wisconsin’s high water mark was 71.8 percent in 1997, compared with 63.8 percent nationally, a difference of 8 points. Nationally, the number reached a high in 2000, at 64.4 percent. Wisconsin has topped that figure in 24 of the past 38 years. Our rating In the debate, Walker said "the rate in which people are working (in Wisconsin) is almost five points higher than it is nationally." He’s right on the numbers, but the same statement could have been true had it been made by any of his seven immediate predecessors, Republican and Democrat. That important bit of context was missing from his claim. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2015-08-21T10:00:00	2015-08-06	['Wisconsin']
pomt-04764	Mitt Romney "gave away his father's inheritance."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/27/reince-priebus/republican-national-committee-chair-reince-priebus/	Mitt Romney, the self-made man. That’s part of the "Mitt Romney story" that Republicans plan to tell at their convention in Tampa this week. His father may have been well-to-do, but Republicans have been emphasizing for weeks that Romney made his millions on his own. Romney’s father, George, was chief executive of Detroit automaker American Motors Corp. and a three-time governor of Michigan who ran for president in the 1960s. Mitt grew up in a wealthy Michigan suburb, attending prep school and ultimately Harvard. He's been the target of silver-spoon attacks because he’s worth more than $100 million. (Perhaps far more.) But Republicans argue he wasn’t handed his wealth — he earned it. He even "gave away his father’s inheritance," national committee chair Reince Priebus repeatedly told TV interviewers on Aug. 26, 2012, as the party prepared to open its convention. We’ve rated a related claim from Romney himself that he "didn’t inherit money" from his parents. That earned a Half True, because he previously told interviewers he did get an inheritance, but donated it to Brigham Young University. This time we’re checking whether he "gave away his father’s inheritance." We’re short on primary evidence for the claim — we haven’t seen his father’s will, nor a receipt from Brigham Young. But there’s a strong circumstantial case that Priebus is correct. Rich get richer George Romney died in 1995 at age 88. By that time, his son had led Bain Capital, the private equity firm he launched in 1984, for more than a decade. As Romney told a C-SPAN interviewer in 2006: "I did get a check from my dad when he passed away. I shouldn’t say a check, but I did inherit some funds from my dad. But I turned and gave that away to charity. In this case I gave it to a school which Brigham Young University established in his honor. ... And that’s where his inheritance ended up." Why did he give the money away? "I figured we had enough of our own," he said. According to a short history of the George W. Romney Institute of Public Management at BYU, the family provided an endowment in 1998, within a few years of George Romney's death. Our ruling Reince Priebus says that Romney "gave away his father's inheritance." Romney has repeatedly said so himself and that's backed up by the simple fact that Brigham Young University has an institute named for his father launched just a few years after his death. And there’s no reason to think Romney would have needed the money a decade after his lucrative move to Bain Capital. We find the evidence supports the claim and we see nothing to contradict it. If any evidence emerges, we'll review it. But in the meantime, we rate Priebus’ claim True.	None	Reince Priebus	None	None	None	2012-08-27T18:02:59	2012-08-26	['None']
pomt-01550	"The president referred to the Syrian opposition just a few months ago as pharmacists and doctors, and so on."	true	/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/14/michael-hayden/former-cia-director-obama-said-syrian-opposition-w/	President Barack Obama drew harsh criticism for comparing the terrorist group Islamic State to a "JV team" — and then again for claiming that’s not what he said (PolitiFact rated that statement False). On Sunday, another one of his characterizations of the situation in the Middle East came under fire as the political talk shows debated his plan for dealing with instability there. Former CIA and NSA director Michael Hayden was asked about Obama’s decision to arm local rebel groups in Syria to help fight the Islamic State there. He wondered why Obama was suddenly interested in arming opposition forces there. "The president referred to the Syrian opposition just a few months ago as pharmacists and doctors, and so on," Hayden said. "We've turned on the dime in terms of our expectation for them, so if we're going to get them to this force that he said it was fantasy to rely on to the force that's going to be, as (White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough) said, the anvil in a combined arms operation, they're going to need an awful lot of help." In this case, we're checking whether Obama described the Syrian rebels as "pharmacists and doctors." We're not checking whether the rebels actually are pharmacists or doctors, as we'll explain in a bit. We tried to reach Hayden but were unsuccessful. McDonough, though, was asked about Obama’s comment during an appearance on CNN’s State of the Union. "I think that the question that the president was responding to at the time was looking back a couple of years," McDonough said. "We have had a relationship with these fighters now for a couple of years. They're getting better and more capable." If that’s the case, then maybe Hayden was embellishing Obama’s comments. Keep in mind, the debate over arming the Syrian opposition forces in their fight against Syrian President Bashar al Assad has been ongoing for years. PolitiFact noted in a fact-check last week that several key members of Obama’s national security team favored the move in August 2012. Let’s take a look at exactly what Obama said. We found four instances of Obama describing the Syrian opposition forces in recent months. May 29 Obama discussed his foreign policy during an interview with NPR. He was asked if conditions were more "robust" for aiding the rebels than in the past. "I wouldn't say the conditions are better," Obama said. "In many ways, the conditions are worse. "When you talk about the moderate opposition, many of these people were farmers or dentists or maybe some radio reporters who didn't have a lot of experience fighting," he added. "But creating a capacity for them to hold ground, to be able to rebuff vicious attacks, for them to be able to also organize themselves in ways that are cohesive — all that takes, unfortunately, more time than I think many people would like." For what it’s worth, the Washington Post fact-checked Obama’s claim about the makeup of Syrian rebels as farmer, dentists and radio reporters and found it to be dubious. June 19 In mid June, a few days before Obama asked Congress for $500 million to train and equip some of the Syrian opposition, he discussed the makeup of those forces on a couple occasions. In a June 19 press conference, a reporter asked Obama if "the expansion of the Syria war into Iraq changed your mind about the type of weapons and training we’re now willing to give the opposition there?" Obama responded: "The question has always been, is there the capacity of moderate opposition on the ground to absorb and counteract extremists that might have been pouring in, as well as an Assad regime supported by Iran and Russia that outmanned them and was ruthless. "And so we have consistently provided that opposition with support," Obama said. "Oftentimes, the challenge is if you have former farmers or teachers or pharmacists who now are taking up opposition against a battle-hardened regime, with support from external actors that have a lot at stake, how quickly can you get them trained; how effective are you able to mobilize them. And that continues to be a challenge." The next morning, he made a similar comment to CBS' This Morning. "When you get farmers, dentists and folks who have never fought before going up against a ruthless opposition in Assad, the notion that they were in a position suddenly to overturn not only Assad but also ruthless, highly trained jihadists if we just sent a few arms is a fantasy." Aug. 8 In a sitdown with New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, Obama again was asked about why he chose not to arm the Syrian rebels. "This idea that we could provide some light arms or even more sophisticated arms to what was essentially an opposition made up of former doctors, farmers, pharmacists and so forth, and that they were going to be able to battle not only a well-armed state but also a well-armed state backed by Russia, backed by Iran, a battle-hardened Hezbollah, that was never in the cards," Obama said. Counter to what McDonough said Sept. 14, Obama very much seems to be talking about the Syrian opposition in the present and the challenges in providing them with assistance and arms. This continued up until August. The one caveat that Hayden does not mention is the conversation was largely in the context of the opposition’s capacity to go up against Assad and the Syrian regime, not their ability to fight a rogue terrorist organization like the Islamic State. Still, it is a noticeable about-face that as recently as August, Obama told Friedman he believed "there’s not as much capacity as you would hope" for providing these individuals training. Our ruling In discussing Obama’s decision to arm opposition forces in Syria, Hayden said, "The president referred to the Syrian opposition just a few months ago as pharmacists and doctors, and so on." We found several examples of Obama, as recently as June and August, characterizing the Syrian rebels as pharmacists and doctors, as well as dentists, radio reporters and teachers. Usually he was describing their capacity to fight Assad, but that doesn’t make Hayden’s point any less accurate. We rate Hayden’s statement True.

pomt-00697	"We spend more money on antacids than we do on politics."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/may/03/john-boehner/john-boehner-we-spend-more-money-antacids-we-do-po/	Bellyaching about the state of American politics doesn’t seem to get very far with House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. In a freewheeling interview with NBC News, Boehner dismissed the idea that special interests or gerrymandered congressional districts undercut what Washington does for the average citizen. And ditto for the billions of dollars that fuel the American political system. "We spend more money on antacids than we do on politics," Boehner told Meet the Press host Chuck Todd on May 3, 2015. "We live in an imperfect democracy. But as bad as it is, let me tell you this. It’s better than any other place in the world." That struck us as a novel comparison. Do Tums and Rolaids lay a bigger claim to Americans’ paychecks than electioneering? We dug into the numbers, and while we are confident that Boehner could tell us how he spells relief when it comes to taxes, his math leaves something to be desired. Boehner’s spokesman Kevin Smith pointed us to two articles. One from the trade publication Drug Topics spoke of a $10 billion yearly market for antacids. The other from the nonprofit organization that tracks political money, the Center for Responsive Politics, said total spending on federal campaigns in 2014 was $3.7 billion. The problem is, that antacid number was for sales worldwide. In America, the total is about $2 billion. We found that estimate from a couple of sources. The business website Statista.com reported $1.96 billion in sales of antacid tablets in 2013. That excludes liquid antacids. We found 2011 figures for both tablets and liquid antacids. Liquid antacid sales add about 5 percent more to the total -- $1.6 billion in tablets compared to about $83 million for liquids. Assuming the same trend held in 2013, we’re looking at a total sales figure around $2 billion. That’s a lot of indigestion, but it’s less than the amount spent on the 2014 federal elections. The most recent data from the Center for Responsive Politics actually puts the total closer to $3.8 billion. That includes spending by the candidates’ campaigns, the party committees, Super PACs and outside groups. Even if we limit the tally just to candidates and the parties, there was still more than $2.7 billion spent. Boehner’s comparison gets into deeper trouble when state-level races are factored in. The National Institute on Money in State Politics reports almost $3 billion in spending in 2014 to elect governors and members of state legislatures. With or without factoring in state money, Boehner’s comparison doesn’t come close. Our ruling Boehner said Americans spend more on antacids than they do on politics. But the evidence Boehner’s office cited was based on worldwide antacid sales. Americans themselves spent more than $2 billion on antacids each year, reports show. Federal campaign spending tops that no matter how you cut it. Using the source provided by Boehner’s office, the total in 2014 was about $3.8 billion. Factoring in state elections makes the disparity even greater. We couldn’t swallow this claim. We rate it False.	None	John Boehner	None	None	None	2015-05-03T16:11:36	2015-05-03	['None']
pomt-07588	Oregon concealed gun applications include "home phone numbers, home address, Social Security numbers, what kinds of guns you have in the house … whether you were dishonorably discharged from the military, what controlled substances you are taking and were you ever accused of -- accused, mind you -- of stalking."	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2011/mar/26/kim-thatcher/kim-thatcher-says-concealed-handgun-applications-r/	The Oregon House recently passed a bill that would remove concealed handgun applications from the public record. Proponents of the bill say that there’s too much personal information on individual citizens tied up in the documents. Public records should focus on the government, not private citizens, they say. Here’s Rep. Kim Thatcher’s full-throated defense of the move from the House debate on the day they passed the bill: "As the law stands now, the information in these applications includes things like, home phone numbers, home address, Social Security numbers, what kinds of guns you have in the house -- that's what's on the application -- whether you were dishonorably discharged from the military, what controlled substances you are taking and were you ever accused of -- accused, mind you -- of stalking," Thatcher, R-Keizer, said. "And right now all of that would be subject to public records disclosure." That’s an awful lot of information, indeed. But being our usual suspicious selves, we wondered whether all of that was truly included in the application. So, we did a quick check -- well, we thought it would be a quick check. We’d just pull down the Multnomah County Sheriff’s online license application and take a look, right? Well, it turns out that each of Oregon’s 36 counties has a slightly different application -- some considerably more stringent, some considerably less. After a few days of web searching and phone calling, we got our hands on 34 of the applications. Here’s what we found: -"Home phone numbers": Yes. This is one of the first things every application we reviewed asks for. -"Home address": Yes, again. You also have to include a mailing address if that’s different. -"Social Security numbers": Sort of. Every application we reviewed asks for a Social Security number, but all, save two, expressly note that "disclosure of your Social Security account number is voluntary." -"What kinds of guns you have in the house": Not usually. On 24 of the applications we looked through, there was no question asking applicants about current ownership. Of the remaining eight, six asked whether you "currently own or possess a firearm," but only if you have ever been dishonorably discharged from the armed forces, renounced your U.S. citizenship, been ordered to register as a sex offender in any state or use controlled substances. Everybody else can skip the question. The remaining four from Baker, Grant, Gilliam and Klamath counties ask all applicants for this information. -"Whether you were dishonorably discharged from the military": Yes, this is on most applications. If you have been, you also have to say when it happened. -"What controlled substances you are taking": Yep, this is there. Such controlled substances, for those who are curious, include but are not "limited to, marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamine, methadone, LSD, or ecstasy." (That quote is from the Multnomah County application.) -"Were you ever accused of ... stalking": Nope. Eleven applications don’t touch on this subject at all. The other 23 ask only if the applicant is "currently subject to any type of restraining or stalking order by the court." They also have to include some specifics about that situation if that question applies to them. That said, if the order has been lifted, the question doesn’t apply -- note the word "currently." For what it’s worth, those last two questions (the one on controlled substances and the one about stalking) are pretty important given that federal law, according to the application, prohibits folks who say yes to those questions from possessing firearms at all, much less handguns of the concealed variety. Thatcher is spot on when it comes to four of her assertions (the phone numbers, home addresses, military discharge and controlled substances), but she’s less accurate on the other three (social security, current gun ownership and stalking). When we called her office, Rep. Thatcher -- and later her spokeswoman Dawn Phillips -- told us she wasn’t making sweeping proclamations about all of the applications. What matters, they said, is that her comments apply to some of the state’s 36 applications. On that point, she’s pretty close to right. That is, except for the stalking claim. Thatcher makes it sound as though anybody accused of stalking at any point in their lives would have to say so on the application. But that’s just no true. On certain applications, you have to noted whether you are currently under a court order. That’s considerably different, in our view. Still, we’ll give her the benefit of the doubt that some of the necessary nuance was left out because her comments were spoken -- not written -- and rate this claim Mostly True. Comment on this item.

pomt-04499	Says U.S. Senate opponent Tammy Baldwin supported a federal budget "that spent trillions -- not billions, trillions -- more money than the Obama budget."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/oct/05/tommy-thompson/budget-backed-democrat-tammy-baldwin-spent-trillio/	In their race for a U.S. Senate seat, Democrat Tammy Baldwin and Republican Tommy Thompson depict each other as out of touch with the typical Wisconsin voter. The Madison congresswoman brands Thompson as a wealthy insider who is "not for you anymore." And the former governor labels Baldwin an extreme liberal. Thompson continued his line of attack on WISN-AM in Milwaukee on Sept. 27, 2012, hours before his first debate with Baldwin. He told conservative talk show host Jay Weber that Baldwin’s "philosophy is to spend as much money as possible and forget about the consequences of the next generation, the consequences of the declining dollar, the consequences of our debt load." "In fact she is so liberal -- I don’t know if people out there really know this -- she joined the Progressive Caucus, which introduced a budget that spent trillions -- not billions, trillions -- more money than the Obama budget." In the same vein, Thompson during the debate called Baldwin the House’s "number one spender" and alluded to her support of "increased spending" with the Progressive Caucus budget. Let’s see if Thompson’s right about the trillions. The caucus The Congressional Progressive Caucus, according to its website, consists of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent, and 75 Democratic members of the House of Representatives. Baldwin is a vice-chair of the group. The caucus gained attention when U.S. Rep. Allen West, R-Fla., claimed in April 2012 that its members were members of the Communist Party. That rated a Pants on Fire from PolitiFact Florida, which confirmed through the Communist Party USA that no members of Congress are members of its party. The fiscal 2012 budget proposed by the Progressive Caucus was what Thompson was referring to when he made his trillions more comment about Baldwin, Thompson campaign spokeswoman Lisa Boothe told us. That plan, unveiled in April 2011, was offered as an alternative to budgets proposed by President Barack Obama and by House Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the Republican vice-presidential nominee. Baldwin did vote for the caucus budget, which was introduced as an amendment to Ryan’s budget. The amendment failed in the House, 347-77. Budget comparisons The Progressive Caucus budget would have spent $44.5 trillion from 2012 to 2021, according to an analysis done for the caucus by the labor-backed Economic Policy Institute. To see how that compared with Obama’s plan over 10 years, we contacted experts from two nonpartisan think tanks: Taxpayers for Common Sense, a government spending watchdog; and the Concord Coalition, which seeks balanced federal budgets. They agreed that Obama’s fiscal 2012 spending plan called for $46 trillion in spending. That’s $1.5 trillion more than the Progressive Caucus Budget. So, Thompson was wrong when he said the Baldwin-backed caucus would spend "trillions more" than Obama’s budget. Thompson has said, in prepared statements before and after his radio interview, that the Progressive Caucus budget would have raised trillions more in taxes than Obama’s budget. And our experts agreed the caucus budget would have collected $42 trillion in taxes over 10 years, some $5 trillion more than Obama’s. But that wasn’t Thompson’s claim on the radio. What’s more, raising taxes doesn’t automatically mean a corresponding increase in spending. Indeed, The Economist magazine, among others, pointed out the Progressive Caucus budget would have reduced federal deficits more than both the Obama and Ryan budgets -- primarily because of its higher taxes and cuts in defense spending. Our rating Thompson claimed Baldwin supported the Progressive Caucus budget, which he said spent "trillions more" than a budget from Obama. Baldwin did back the proposal, which would have raised taxes by trillions more than the president. But the caucus plan would have actually spent less money than the Obama plan. We rate Thompson’s statement False.	None	Tommy Thompson	None	None	None	2012-10-05T09:00:00	2012-10-27	['Tammy_Baldwin', 'Barack_Obama', 'United_States']
pomt-03213	Wisconsin’s criminal threshold for drunken-driving is "way out of line" with "states surrounding us," which "have the second offense as a felony."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/aug/25/alberta-darling/alberta-darling-says-wisconsins-neighbors-make-fel/	Whenever state officials debate tougher penalties for drunken driving, critics raise concerns about the high cost of additional jail time for offenders. State Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, the co-leader of the latest get-tough push, recently confronted that critique head-on while arguing to make third-offense drunken-driving a felony in Wisconsin. "We can’t just say, ‘It costs too much,’" Darling said in testimony before an Assembly committee Aug. 15, 2013. "What does that say to the victims and the victims’ families, that it costs too much to make a third do-over a felony? Why does it have to be a fourth offense as a felony?" Then she made a geographical appeal, twice saying during the hearing that Wisconsin is "way out of line" with some Midwestern neighbors. "The states surrounding us, Illinois, Iowa and Indiana, have the second offense as a felony," Darling said. "That tells me that that is a reasonable public policy, that other states that are like-minded, that are Midwesterners with similar values, feel that’s what is appropriate. To me that counts. We are way out of line, that you get three do-overs." It’s well known that Wisconsin is the only state in which first-offense drunken driving is not charged as a crime; it’s treated as a civil matter featuring stiff money forfeitures. In fact, the second is still a civil forfeiture if the new offense is more than 10 years after the first, though it’s a criminal misdemeanor if it’s within the decade. But we wondered if the gap between the Badger State and our close neighbors on felony OWI is as stark as Darling described. So we compared Wisconsin’s law to that in the three states Darling mentioned, plus border states Minnesota and Michigan. Darling did not explicitly mention them, but they meet her definition of "surrounding us" (especially compared to Indiana, which doesn’t touch Wisconsin). We’ll confine our review to incidents that involve no aggravating factors such as causing injury or having children in the car. Here’s what we found: Wisconsin: The fourth offense here is a felony that carries a prison term of six months to six years -- but only if a previous offense was within the last five years. Otherwise, that fourth offense is a criminal misdemeanor with a 60 day to 1 year term, state penalty information shows. The third offense is now a criminal misdemeanor. The bill that Darling and Rep. Jim Ott, R-Mequon, have introduced with 13 co-sponsors would change that third offense to a Class H felony with a minimum of 45 days of imprisonment. And the bill would make fourth offense OWI a felony regardless of the timing of prior convictions. Much stiffer sentences would apply if the fourth is within five years of a prior incident. Iowa: Drunken driving becomes a felony quicker than under current Wisconsin law, but upon the third offense, not the second as Darling said. The first and second offenses are both criminal misdemeanors -- an aggravated one in the case of second. Illinois: As in Iowa, it’s the third offense that is a felony. The first two offenses are criminal misdemeanors. Michigan: The same as Iowa and Illinois -- third offense is a felony in Michigan. Indiana: The second offense is a felony if it’s within 5 years of the prior conviction. If the time gap is wider, it gets charged as a misdemeanor -- and that holds true even if it’s a third or fourth offense or more. Minnesota: As in Wisconsin, drunken driving without any aggravating factors is not charged as a crime until the fourth offense. Minnesota sweeps in offenses from the prior 10 years, though, compared with Wisconsin’s five. In sum, four out of our five closest neighbors clearly make drunken driving a felony faster than does Wisconsin. Minnesota, by contrast, is much like Wisconsin on this score. So "out of line" clearly would apply. But "way" out of line? It’s a bit of a subjective phrase, but Darling defined it in a specific way -- that the others make drunken driving a felony on second offense. By that measure, Darling was wrong -- with one exception. Among the surrounding states, only in Indiana is OWI a felony at second offense, and only if the offense is within five years of the first episode. Bob Delaporte, a Darling aide, told us Darling misspoke in saying some of Wisconsin’s neighboring states make it a felony at second offense. Before we close, a disclaimer. This analysis was confined to a simple look at when a felony classification kicks in. We did not try to sort out here the many complexities involved in determining whether one state’s law is truly "tougher" or "weaker" when factors such as plea bargaining and sentencing variations are considered. Still, a felony conviction undeniably packs a special punch, in terms of the loss of rights and stigma. "A felony is such a career killer," said Donald Ramsell, an Illinois attorney and national expert on drunken driving penalties. Nationally, about half the states mirror Wisconsin’s current approach or are more lenient in terms of when -- or if -- a felony charge enters the picture, various state surveys show. Our rating Darling said Wisconsin’s drunken-driving penalties are "way out of line" with "states surrounding us," which "have the second offense as a felony." In contrast to Wisconsin, where fourth offense can be a felony, four out of five of the state’s closest neighbors make it a felony faster than Wisconsin. But only one does so at the second offense as Darling said. Three put the threshold at third offense, and another puts it at fourth, as in Wisconsin. There is a gap between Wisconsin and neighboring states, so there’s an element of truth here, but for the most part that gap is not as wide as Darling said. We rate her claim Mostly False.

pomt-14659	Says the Democratic Party created a debate schedule "to maximize the opportunity for voters to see our candidates."	false	/florida/statements/2016/jan/20/debbie-wasserman-schultz/democratic-debates-maximize-exposure-debbie-wasser/	Responding to rampant criticism about the Democratic Party’s presidential debate schedule, Debbie Wasserman Schultz has boasted about viewership numbers. The critics include party leaders as well as Hillary Clinton’s primary rivals, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley. Some Democrats say that the schedule of six debates including some on weekends limits voters’ exposure, giving Clinton an edge. But Wasserman Schultz says ratings show that voters have had plenty of TV face time with the Democratic candidates. "In fact, our first debate beat at least two of the Republican debates. And our last debate, compared to the Republican last debate, was just a little bit less than theirs," the Democratic National Committee chair told CNN’s Brian Stelter Jan. 17, hours before the debate over the Martin Luther King weekend in Charleston. After Stelter pressed her, Wasserman Schultz, a Broward County congresswoman, replied: "Brian, there's no number of debates that will satisfy everyone. So, I did my best to make sure, along with my staff and along with our debate partners, to come up with a schedule that we felt was going to maximize the opportunity for voters to see our candidates." Clearly, we can't rate what people within the Democratic party intended. Our fact-check looks at what the outcome was. Did the Democrats "maximize the opportunity" for voters to see their candidates? We found there’s no fair reading of the Democratic debate schedule that supports this. Democratic and Republican debate schedules in 2016 The Democrats scheduled six primary debates; the Republicans scheduled 11 primary debates (plus one more in March that is unscheduled). So far, Democrats have held four debates with a cumulative viewership of about 42.5 million while Republicans have held six debates with a cumulative viewership of about 103.7 million, according to Nielsen ratings of same-day viewership. Democratic debates: Date Day of week Network Viewership Oct. 13, 2015 Tuesday CNN 15.8 million Nov. 14, 2015 Saturday CBS 8.5 million Dec. 19, 2015 Saturday ABC News 8 million Jan. 17, 2016 Sunday NBC News 10.2 million Feb. 11, 2016 Thursday PBS TBD March 9, 2016 Wednesday Univision TBD Republican debates: Date Day of week Network Viewership Aug. 6, 2015 Thursday Fox News 24 million Sept. 16, 2015 Wednesday CNN 23 million Oct. 28, 2015 Wednesday CNBC 14 million Nov. 10, 2015 Tuesday Fox Business Network 13.5 million Dec. 15, 2015 Tuesday CNN 18.2 million Jan. 14, 2016 Thursday Fox Business Network 11.1 million Jan. 28, 2016 Thursday Fox News TBD Feb. 6, 2016 Saturday ABC TBD Feb. 13, 2016 Saturday CBS TBD Feb. 25, 2016 Thursday CNN TBD March 10, 2016 Thursday CNN TBD Back in 2008, when Barack Obama won the nomination, the Democrats held about 25 primary debates while the Republicans held 21. Overall, it looks like the GOP is doing a significantly better job of reaching viewers. Wasserman Schultz response In defense of Wasserman Schultz’s statement, DNC spokesman Sean Bartlett raised several points: • There are more GOP candidates than Democratic candidates. At the outset of the 2016 race, there were 17 Republican candidates but only five Democratic candidates. • Only three Democratic debates in 2008 topped the Democrats’ lowest rated debate this cycle. • The first Democratic debate drew 15.8 million viewers, surpassing the viewership of three of the Republican debates this cycle. • All but one of the Democratic debates are on broadcast network TV, which makes it more likely for people without cable to tune into the debates. • The schedule of one debate a month for six months doesn’t pull the candidates away from town halls and other events with voters. Still, Wasserman Schultz has faced constant questions about the debate schedule, specifically whether it was intended to help Clinton or minimize viewership. "That’s ridiculous," she said on Jan. 11 in Broward County. "I don’t know how many times I have to say it." She said that the Sunday debate in Charleston -- the city where nine African-Americans were killed at a church in 2015 -- was a recommendation by the Congressional Black Caucus Institute and NBC to coincide with Martin Luther King weekend. Experts dispute Wasserman Schultz’s characterization We contacted five professors of political science and communications. None of them bought Wasserman Schultz’s statement. "By the time voting starts in Iowa, potential voters will have seen about 40 percent less of Democratic candidates on the debate stage than their Republican counterparts," University of Michigan’s Director of Debate Aaron Kall told PolitiFact. Kall cited several factors contributing to the larger Republican viewership: • The first Republican debate occurred in early August, before the start of the NFL and NCAA college football seasons. Viewer anticipation is usually highest for the first debate. The Democrats didn't host their first debate until over two months later. • Of the four Democratic debates so far, three were on weekends, including the Dec. 19 debate a week before Christmas and the same night as the New York Jets vs. Dallas Cowboys NFL game. The Jan. 17 debate was the day before the Martin Luther King, Jr. Day holiday. Kall cited two major factors beyond the Democrats’ control that have aided superior Republican ratings: a much larger GOP field and the phenomenon of Donald Trump, an entertainment star in his own right from his time on The Apprentice. John Schroeder at Northeastern University noted that the two highest Republican debates each drew between 23 million and 24 million, much higher than the Democratic debates. While a lot of the disparity is due to Trump, another factor is that all the Republican debates so far have been held on weekdays. "I think we can safely say that weekend time slots are not the key to maximizing the viewing audience," Schroeder said. Our ruling Wasserman Schultz says the party came up with a debate schedule "to maximize the opportunity for voters to see our candidates." Wasserman Schultz’s best point is that the Democrats largely scheduled their debates with TV networks, which means viewers without cable can see them. But other than that, her statement is very disingenuous. There are six Democratic party debates compared with 11 scheduled for the Republicans, and half of the Democratic debates are on weekends -- including one the weekend before Christmas and another on the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend. If the Democrats had wanted to "maximize" opportunities for viewers, the party could have added more debates, scheduled them on weekdays and avoided holidays.

pomt-11517	In Parkland, Fla. "the mass murderer was immersed in Islamic and leftwing hate."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/feb/19/pamela-geller/no-proof-nikolas-cruz-was-motivated-islamic-or-lef/	A conservative website portrayed Nikolas Cruz, who admitted to fatally gunning down 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, as sharing views of certain Muslims and leftists. "The mass murderer was immersed in Islamic and leftwing hate," stated a story on the Geller Report website on Feb. 14, the day of the shooting at the Parkland, Fla., school. The author of the website, Pamela Geller, is an activist who co-founded Stop Islamization of America, also known as the American Freedom Defense Initiative, a far-right group. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. We found no evidence that Cruz was immersed in Islamic or left-wing hate. Most of Geller’s story has nothing to do with political views held by Cruz. It largely repeats an initial story by Fox News the day of the shooting and showed some of Cruz’s alleged Instagram posts, identified by other teenagers as his, which included images of guns and knives as well as an image of a bullseye target with bullet holes that included the phrase "Group Therapy." Geller included an image from what was believed to be Cruz’s Instagram account showing a Google search for the Arabic phrase "Allahu Akbar." The phrase, which means "God is greater," is used by Muslims on many occasions and in prayers but has also at times been uttered by people commiting attacks. Cruz’s Instagram account has since been shut down; however, multiple media reports stated that Cruz appeared to make fun of Islam when he wrote that "at least we now know what it means when a sand durka says ‘allahu Akbar.'" We sent Geller a summary of our findings and asked if she had evidence to support her claim. "He mocked the phrase, but then he turned to violence himself. This indicates that underneath his mockery, he had an affinity with those who scream this phrase while murdering people," she told PunditFact in an email. Geller said that Cruz’s interest in the phrase "Allahu Akbar" "doesn't mean he was an Islamic jihadi, but his mockery of it may have been an attempt to deflect attention from his aspirations, or maybe even to try to convince himself not to take the path he ultimately chose. Ultimately, we cannot know for sure what was in his mind, or what was left of it." Law enforcement are investigating motives and his social media posts. The portrait that has emerged of Cruz so far is not of a person motivated by political views, but one of a young man who was drawn to firearms and had a troubled past. Cruz had regularly gotten in trouble at school at least since middle school and had transferred out of Stoneman Douglas in 2017 and had since attended alternative schools. He had a history of mental illness, and police had been called to his home. Cruz’s mother died in November; his father died when he was a young child. Ocean Parodie, 17, told The Daily Beast that Cruz wore patriotic shirts that "seemed really extreme, like hating on" Islam and would also deride Muslims as "terrorists and bombers." In general teenagers who knew Cruz used words such as "off," "weird" and "crazy" to describe him to journalists. Some initial news reports stated that Cruz was affiliated with a white nationalist group in Florida, but law enforcement said they didn’t have information to support that connection. A white nationalist appeared to have spread misinformation to media outlets. We emailed spokespersons for Instagram, the FBI and the Broward Sheriff’s Office to ask some questions about Cruz’s Instagram account but not did get a reply. Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel did not offer any involvement in Islamic or hate groups to explain why Cruz walked into the school with an assault weapon in a Feb. 18 interview with Local 10 ABC’s Michael Putney. When asked why Cruz shot up the school Israel said: "Because he is an evil killer." The Geller Report described Cruz as being "immersed in Islamic and leftwing hate." Law enforcement are investigating motives, but so far Cruz appeared to be a person who had mental illness and a fascination with guns. A mocking Instagram post attributed to him showed he Googled the phrase "Allahu Akbar" but that doesn’t prove that he was immersed in Islamic and left-wing hate. We found no evidence to support Geller’s claim. We rate this statement Pants on Fire. ' See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Pamela Geller	None	None	None	2018-02-19T14:42:57	2018-02-14	['Islam']
pomt-14805	Says Russ Feingold "wanted to get money out of politics. Now he's profiting from that same dark money."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/nov/27/national-republican-senatorial-committee/campaign-finance-reformer-russ-feingold-profiting-/	A television ad attacking Wisconsin Democrat Russ Feingold, who is aiming to reclaim the U.S. Senate seat he held for 18 years, opens with images of rapidly rotting fruit. The National Republican Senatorial Committee spot aired in Milwaukee and Green Bay during the GOP presidential debate in Milwaukee on Nov. 10, 2015. It contends that Feingold’s time in Washington changed him for the worse. "His values decayed, his principles eroded and he lost touch with Wisconsin," the narrator says midway into the ad. "He wanted to get money out of politics. Now he’s profiting from that same dark money." Feingold has long championed campaign finance reforms, though he earned a Full Flop on our Flip-O-Meter for reversing his position on raising most of his campaign funds from Wisconsin residents. But is Feingold "profiting" from "dark money"? That is, money spent in election campaigns by groups that don’t have to disclose their donors? More darkness Dark money spending is rising, we found earlier this month in rating as True a claim by U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis. So far in the 2015-2016 election, $4.88 million in dark money expenditures, mostly by conservative groups, have been made. That’s more than 10 times what was spent at this point during the 2011-2012 cycle -- when a total of $308 million in dark money was spent. It remains to be seen how much dark money might be spent on either side as Feingold challenges Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson in 2016, in a rematch of their 2010 contest. The ad In the TV ad, when the claim about Feingold and dark money is made, footnotes alluding to two news articles appear on the screen. The major one was a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story in June 2015 on spending by two groups Feingold formed in February 2011: Progressives United PAC, a liberal political action committee, and Progressives United Inc., a so-called 501(c)(4) nonprofit organization. The Journal Sentinel article reported that data compiled by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics showed the PAC had given a mere 5 percent of its income to federal candidates and political parties. Instead, nearly half of the $7.1 million that had been spent went to raising more money for itself. The article also said Feingold and nine of his former campaign and U.S. Senate staffers drew salaries or consulting fees from the PAC, and five of them also spent time on the payroll of Progressives United Inc., the nonprofit. PACs, however, are required to disclose their donors. So, our focus here is on the Progressives United Inc. nonprofit. It is a dark money group in that 501(c)(4) groups (a reference to the Internal Revenue Service code) are not required to disclose their donors. At the same time, nothing prevents nonprofits such as Progressives United Inc. from disclosing donors on their own. The money Federal tax filings show Progressives United Inc. paid Feingold as president of the group $10,000 in 2011, $30,000 in 2012 and $19,500 in 2013 -- a total of $59,500. But he is no longer "profiting" from the nonprofit in that he took a leave from Progressives United after being selected a special envoy to the Great Lakes region of Africa in June 2013. He hasn’t received any payments since 2013. But Progressives United Inc. didn’t actually operate as a conventional dark-money group does -- at least while it was active. A Feingold campaign spokesman sent us links (using the "Way Back Machine" -- archive.org) so that we could access pages from the Progressive United Inc. website that have since been taken down. The donors were listed for 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014. But Progressives United Inc. stopped operating at the end of 2014 and its website is dormant. That means the donor lists are no longer readily available -- at a time, with Feingold running for the Senate, when public interest in the lists might be high. A Feingold campaign spokesman told us the website is no longer active because Progressives United Inc. no longer is taking in income to pay for expenses such as web hosting. Our rating The National Republican Senatorial Committee said Feingold "wanted to get money out of politics. Now he's profiting from that same dark money." Feingold received $59,500 in salary from Progressives United Inc., a non-profit founded by Feingold that is not required to disclose its donors, but stopped receiving payments in 2013. While it was active, the group voluntarily listed its donors on its website. But those lists are no longer readily accessible, since the group’s website is no longer active. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, our rating is Half True.

pomt-11468	The 2018 Academy Awards show was the "lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/06/donald-trump/donald-trump-correct-about-record-low-ratings-2018/	President Donald Trump -- who has often invoked television ratings either as a sign of his own strength or of his rivals’ weakness -- appeared to take pleasure in the disappointing performance of the 2018 Oscars, which aired on ABC on March 4. Two days after the show aired, Trump tweeted, "Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY. Problem is, we don’t have Stars anymore - except your President (just kidding, of course)!" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Was Trump right that 2018 marked a low point for the Oscars? Since the beginning of Nielsen TV audience ratings in 1974, yes. The 2018 show attracted 26.5 million viewers, down almost 20 percent from the 2017 show. (Both were hosted by ABC late-night host Jimmy Kimmel.) Adweek noted that the 2018 Oscars "won’t end up as the year’s highest-rated entertainment telecast," since it has already been beaten out by the post-Super Bowl episode of the prime-time drama This Is Us. This is not a one-year downward blip, either. Oscars viewership in 2018 fell by 39 percent from its level just four years earlier, in 2014, when Ellen DeGeneres hosted for ABC. The previous low of 31.8 million viewers came in 2008, when Jon Stewart hosted not long after a lengthy writers' strike ended. Here’s a summary of viewership totals since 2008: See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com The all-time high for viewership came in 1998, when Billy Crystal hosted the ceremony and 55 million viewers watched. In 1998, the blockbuster Titanic won 11 Oscars, including Best Picture. Experts say the connection between high box office grosses and high viewership is more than coincidence. This year’s nominated films earned far less than Titanic, which had grossed north of $300 million by the time of the 1998 awards ceremony. The top earner among 2018’s best picture nominees was Dunkirk with $188 million, and only two other nominees this year made in excess of $60 million domestically. (All made additional money overseas.) Movie Domestic gross Dunkirk $188 million Get Out $176 million The Post $80 million The Shape of Water $57 million Darkest Hour $56 million Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri $52 million Lady Bird $48 million Phantom Thread $20 million Call Me by Your Name $17 million "Most of the movies up for Oscars in multiple categories are films that average moviegoers have not seen," said Eric Deggans, NPR’s television critic. "That's a function of our fragmented media landscape." Among the widely seen films that were shut out of high-profile Oscars nominations were Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Wonder Woman, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Beauty and the Beast and The Fate of the Furious. Still, Deggans added that movie grosses aren’t the only factor to blame for low viewership. In fact, The Shape of Water -- this year’s Best Picture winner -- was the highest grossing film to win Best Picture since 2013, when Argo won. Rather, the longer-term -- and more intractable -- problem for the Oscars is the fragmentation of the television audience. And this goes beyond the impact of digital streaming, which isn’t tabulated in the Nielsen ratings. "Every awards show on television has seen erosion, and many are notching record lows in viewership," Deggans said. "There are more things than ever competing for an audience's attention, and more alternatives for people who might not want to sit through something as conventional as an awards ceremony." Ratings for the most recent Grammys fell by almost one-quarter in just one year, while the Screen Actors Guild Awards fell by 30 percent and the Golden Globes fell by 5 percent. This year’s Super Bowl had the lowest audience since 2009. Our ruling Trump said the 2018 Academy Awards show was the "lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY." He’s right, at least going back to 1974, when Nielsen started reporting ratings. We rate Trump’s statement True.

pomt-03533	"Two weeks after signing a taxpayer protection pledge, (Charlie Crist) breaks it."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/may/30/republican-party-florida/state-republicans-say-it-took-charlie-crist-only-t/	The Republican Party of Florida is launching a pre-emptive strike against former golden boy Charlie Crist, who very well could run for governor in 2014 as a Democrat. In a new Web ad, the state GOP spoofs the History Channel with a segment called "This Day in CRIST-ory." The date: May 28, 2009. (The date should be May 27, but the state GOP flubbed that.) The setting: Tallahassee. The story: Then-Republican Gov. Crist is signing a $66.5 billion budget that includes a $1-a-pack cigarette tax and higher fees on drivers licenses and motor vehicle tags. The new taxes and fees, which are estimated to generate $2.2 billion, are needed to pass a balanced state budget -- and were supported by Republicans in the Legislature -- but also break Crist’s pledge not to raise taxes. "Two weeks after signing a taxpayer protection pledge, he (Crist) breaks it!" the Republican Party’s ad exclaims. Here at PolitiFact Florida, we didn’t need a history lesson to remember the basics of the 2009 budget. But we did wonder about the state GOP’s assertion that Crist had the gall to break a pledge just two weeks after he signed it. Crist, it turns out, did sign a taxpayer protection pledge two weeks before signing the budget into law. We found that through a press release from … the Republican Party of Florida. At the time, Crist had recently announced he was running for the U.S. Senate, and Republicans far and wide were rallying around his candidacy. (Well, except former House Speaker Marco Rubio. That’s for another day in CRIST-ory.) But the pledge Crist signed on May 14, 2009, was for federal candidates, not state ones. And it was specific to income taxes. Not taxes in general. Crist signed a pledge from the Americans for Tax Reform, a well-known anti-tax group led by Grover Norquist. In it, Crist promised to "oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals and/or businesses; and ... oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates." A tax pledge yes, but one that wouldn’t be broken with a tax on cigarettes or motor vehicle fees. That doesn’t get Crist out of hot water, however. Crist signed another taxpayer pledge from Americans for Tax Reform in June 2005. In that pledge, Crist promised to "oppose and veto any and all efforts to increase taxes." "Pledges are important, but actions speak louder," Crist said in an email to supporters in December 2005. "Throughout my years of public service I have stood squarely against tax increases, and will continue to do so as governor." Crist’s 2009 budget signature does appear to violate his older pledge -- particularly in allowing the $1-a-pack cigarette tax to become law. "The cigarette tax is appropriate, and I really view it more as a health issue than I do as a tax issue," Crist said May 19, 2009. "(Ronald) Reagan said when you want to kill something you ought to tax it. Well, it wouldn't be bad if you killed smoking. There are about 2 million Floridians, maybe a few less, who smoke. And it's not good for you." (We looked for that Reagan quote, the closest we could find was," Government's view of the economy could be summed up in a few short phrases: If it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving, regulate it. And if it stops moving, subsidize it.") Republican Party of Florida spokesman Matt Moon admitted the mistake in the ad's phrasing. "While it's true we should have been more precise and not used the words 'two weeks,' ... he did sign a taxpayer protection pledge that he did break," Moon said. "And we're still going to call him out on it." Our ruling In a new Web ad, the state GOP portrayed Crist as a man who didn’t keep his word when it comes to raising taxes. The record there is pretty clear. Crist signed a pledge saying he would oppose efforts to increase taxes, yet signed a budget that included a $1-a-pack cigarette tax. However, the state Republican Party went unnecessarily far when it tried to say that it took Crist just two weeks to break that promise. The pledge he signed two weeks before approving the cigarette tax did not apply. We rate the Republicans’ claim Mostly False.

pomt-05813	Says he banned texting while driving in Austin.	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/feb/21/mike-martinez/mike-martinez-says-he-banned-texting-while-driving/	Mike Martinez, an Austin City Council member seeking re-election in May, recently pointed supporters to his campaign website, which includes an issues page touching on ways he says he’s delivered for the Austin community. On the page, which we viewed Feb. 10, 2012, Martinez says he helped lead efforts to protect an East Austin spring, helped the city establish a "no-kill" policy at municipal animal shelters and helped launch a community gardens program. We’re not checking any of that for this article. But we paused at another Martinez point: "Banned texting while driving to improve safety for drivers, bicyclists and pedestrians." Martinez banned TWD in ATX? Austin’s texting-while-driving ban, which took effect Jan. 1, 2010, has yielded about $31,800 in fine revenue for the city’s general fund, according to Rebecca Stark, the city’s municipal court director. She told us that 93 drivers in 2010 and 158 drivers in 2011 pleaded no contest or guilty or were found guilty of violating the ban. In 2010, 121 cases of ban violations were filed, she said. That figure nearly doubled to 222 in 2011. In a telephone interview, Martinez, a former firefighter who won his first council term in 2006, told us that as a member of the city’s public safety task force, he brought up the idea of banning texting while driving, initially to derision. He said he asked the Austin Police Department to research texting as a local traffic hazard and after years of community conversations, the seven-member City Council approved the ordinance. Martinez told us that he did not ban texting by his lonesome: "Anything we do has to be ratified by the council. I did take a certain ownership and pride in this issue. I was the only council member to originally call for a ban on texting." According to Austin American-Statesman news articles, the ordinance barring texting while driving won unanimous council approval in October 2009. Violations are Class C misdemeanors subject to fines of up to $500. Some Statesman stories describe Martinez as the council’s lead proponent of the ban. In November 2008, the public safety task force voted to urge City Manager Marc Ott to develop a ban proposal. A Nov. 4, 2008, Statesman news article says "Martinez, who is leading the effort, said he has received dozens of calls in recent months from motorists, pedestrians and bicyclists asking for such a law. "It is something that needs to be done," the story quotes Martinez saying. "When you see accidents that have happened or you hear about near-misses, it is just a step we can take to ensure the safety of our citizens."" In August 2009, the council directed city staffers to draft the proposed ban as an ordinance. An Aug. 28, 2009, Statesman news article refers to Martinez as the lead proponent of the ban. According to minutes of the Oct. 22, 2009, council meeting during which members adopted the ban, Martinez made the "main motion" for its approval. The motion was seconded by Mayor Lee Leffingwell. Upshot: Martinez’s claim overshoots because, of course, he could not have imposed the ban by himself. The seven-person council acts on proposed ordinances. Still, Martinez was a leading advocate of the ban. We rate his statement Half True.	None	Mike Martinez	None	None	None	2012-02-21T06:00:00	2012-02-10	['Austin,_Texas']
pomt-11976	Some states hit hardest by opioid deaths "have more opioid prescriptions than residents."	true	/new-york/statements/2017/oct/02/eric-schneiderman/do-some-states-have-more-opioid-prescriptions-resi/	New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said prescribers in some states have been so lenient that they have given out more prescriptions than there are residents in those states. With 33,091 opioid-related deaths in 2015 across the country, the ease in getting prescriptions for the painkillers has become an issue attracting attention from state officials. "Some states hardest hit by the crisis have more opioid prescriptions than residents," Schneiderman said at a press conference. Twenty-three states have a higher rate of opioid overdose deaths than New York state. But is Schneiderman right that some of those states have more opioid prescriptions than residents? National numbers Eight states reported more opioid prescriptions than residents in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control. The states are Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee, West Virginia, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Kentucky, and Louisiana. Alabama recorded the highest rate, with 125 opioid prescriptions for every 100 people in the state. Even so, Alabama had a lower rate of opioid-related deaths than most other states, according to Centers for Disease Control data analyzed by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health policy research organization. Two other top prescribing states — West Virginia and Kentucky — had some of the highest rates of opioid related deaths. West Virginia had the highest rate in the country, with 36 opioid deaths for every 100,000 residents. The state reported 111 opioid prescriptions for every 100 residents. Kentucky, ranking sixth with 21 deaths for every 100,000 residents, had 102 prescriptions for every 100 residents in 2015. West Virginia’s rate decreased in 2016 to 96 prescriptions for every 100 people. Kentucky’s went down to 97 opioid prescriptions for every 100 people. Alabama remained highest with 121 prescriptions for every 100 people. New York state numbers New York state had 42 prescriptions for every 100 residents in 2016. There were no counties in New York with more opioid prescriptions than residents, according to the state Department of Health. Montgomery County had the highest rate in the state with 82 opioid prescriptions for every 100 residents in the county. The county had two opioid deaths for one of the lowest opioid-related death rates in the state. Our ruling Schneiderman said some states hit hardest by the opioid crisis "have more opioid prescriptions than residents." West Virginia and Kentucky — two states with the highest rates of opioid deaths in the country — reported more opioid prescriptions than their respective population, according to CDC data. Six other states had more prescriptions than residents, too. We rate his claim True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Eric Schneiderman	None	None	None	2017-10-02T04:00:00	2017-09-19	['None']
pomt-01139	"Surveys of teens in high school reveal that knowing a classmate who sells cannabis is 90 times more common than knowing a classmate who sells alcohol."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/dec/21/james-crowley/doctor-says-teens-much-likelier-know-classmate-sel/	A retired doctor recently included an eye-catching statistic in a commentary in The Providence Journal urging the legalization of marijuana in Rhode Island. "Surveys of teens in high school reveal that knowing a classmate who sells cannabis is 90 times more common than knowing a classmate who sells alcohol," wrote James P. Crowley, a past president of the Rhode Island Medical Society and professor emeritus of medicine at Brown University, in a piece published Dec. 6, 2014. Crowley cited the statistic to demonstrate that cannabis is the most commonly sold drug in schools. He warned that its prohibition introduces teens to an underground culture of increasingly more dangerous substances. Crowley supports legislation that would regulate, rather than prohibit cannabis. (In 2013, Rhode Island became the 15th state to decriminalize non-medical marijuana possession; anyone caught with up to one ounce is subject to a $150 fine instead of facing a misdemeanor criminal charge.) While we were doubtful about an underground culture of selling alcohol in schools, we wondered whether Crowley was right. We sent him an email asking him for his source. We also reached out to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to see what comparable statistics these federal agencies had. All responded they did not have data to verify the statement. When Crowley got back to us, he attributed the information to Jared Moffat, director of Regulate Rhode Island, a group that supports legalizing marijuana. Moffat, in turn, referred us to a survey of students, ages 12 to 17, published in 2012 by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University. The "National Survey of American Attitudes on Substance Abuse XVII: Teens," found that 44 percent of the 1,003 students surveyed reported they knew a student who sold drugs at their school. Among that 44 percent, 91 percent reported that they knew a student who sold marijuana on school grounds while about 1 percent, said they knew a student who sold alcohol. The National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University did not pose the same question to students in previous surveys, and did not publish a 2013 survey. We reached out to Rhode Island KidsCount and to the state Department of Education to see what information they might have for Rhode Island students. KidsCount did not track that particular information. Elliot Krieger, spokesman for the state Department of Education, referred us to the "SurveyWorks" student survey of 2013-2014. Among the roughly 32,000 Rhode Island students who offered a response, 10.2 percent said someone had sold or given them an illegal drug on school property in the past year. Similarly, 9.5 percent reported that they had been under the influence of alcohol at school in the same timeframe. We also asked Robert Houghtaling, director of the East Greenwich Drug Program, for his take on Crowley’s claim that high school pot dealers far outnumbered students selling alcohol. "Kids usually don’t have to sell alcohol. It’s so easily accessible," Houghtaling said."They steal it from their parents, secure a fake ID, or arrange for someone to buy it for them. "In terms of using, alcohol is still the predominantly most-used drug," he said. "Alcohol is so prevalent people view it as a rite of passage." Our ruling James P. Crowley wrote that "Surveys of teens in high school reveal that knowing a classmate who sells cannabis is 90 times more common than knowing a classmate who sells alcohol." But he could only cite one survey, and we couldn’t find any others that asked the same question. One data point does not a trend make. In addition, his statement suggests that the findings of this survey reflect the results from all students polled. It doesn’t. It only looked at the subset of students who said they knew of someone who sold drugs in school. Because the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, we rate it Half True.

pomt-14183	"Over the past two years, Florida has cut more than $1 billion in taxes."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2016/apr/25/rick-scott/gov-rick-scotts-claim-about-1-billion-tax-cuts-nee/	Despite lawmakers virtually ignoring his budget wish list during the 2016 legislative session, Gov. Rick Scott is boasting about fulfilling a campaign promise to cut taxes by $1 billion in his second term. Scott took credit for the fiscal feat both before and after signing the Legislature’s wide-ranging tax-cut package, HB 7099. "Over the past two years, Florida has cut more than $1 billion in taxes," an April 13, 2016, press release from the governor’s office read. Scott had pledged to hit the billion-dollar mark in tax reductions during his successful 2014 re-election campaign, mostly by giving breaks to businesses and limiting property tax growth. In his March 15 press release announcing his intention to sign the Legislature’s budget, Scott said he’d kept his promise with $1.2 billion in tax cuts over the first two years of his second term. Scott has repeated this claim several times in one form or another. But have taxes really gone down by more than $1 billion in two years, like he says? It depends on how you look at what the Legislature has done, but the changes haven’t happened the way Scott wanted. Tallying the taxes When we asked Scott’s office to break down their budget math for us, they pointed to a chart in their March 15 press release, without further detail: We were able to verify the figures from Scott’s office based on changes passed by the Legislature the last two years. The Florida Office of Economic and Demographic Research compiles an annual list of how much tax revenue will be affected by bills passed during that year’s legislative session (these can change as the fiscal picture becomes clearer). The House also analyzed HB 7099 to estimate how much the bill would change tax receipts. Cell phone & TV tax cut: In 2015, the Legislature passed a 1.73 percentage point reduction in the state’s communications services tax, a charge on consumer cell phone, cable and satellite bills. That amounted to a $21 annual reduction on a $100 monthly cell phone and cable bill. Scott had wanted to cut the tax by $120 million, something we’d rated a Promise Kept on our Scott-O-Meter. Property tax reduction: This one is tricky, because it’s more of a tax shift than a tax cut. Scott also is taking credit for a solution he didn’t want. During the 2016 session, the House and Senate agreed to increase per-pupil education spending for K-12 students, something Scott had wanted. Scott initially wanted the bump in education funding paid almost entirely through higher local property tax collections, not with general revenue. (Scott had previously proposed limiting property tax increases with a constitutional amendment, a campaign promise he has so far ignored.) Higher property values meant that collections would increase whether lawmakers raised the key millage rate for local property tax dollars for schools or kept it the same. Instead, the Legislature cut the local rate and paid for the $428 million difference they needed with general tax revenue. Legislators mostly referred to this as "tax relief," and not a tax cut. We’ve rated a similar statement Mostly True, because the change altered future collections, instead of cutting current collections. Property owners, however, are still shielded from a tax hike. Senate Appropriations Chairman Tom Lee, R-Brandon, told the Tampa Bay Times that if you include this revenue swap, Scott "technically" had reached $1 billion in tax cuts. But that’s dependent on Scott accepting a plan he opposed. The Legislature has to revisit education funding every year, too, so this will no doubt change. Back to school sales tax holiday: Scott counts these breaks from sales tax on school supplies as a cut. These aren’t permanent cuts, because the Legislature has to approve whether there will be sales tax holidays each year. His figures do jibe with state estimates. The totals are different, in part, because the 2015 holiday was 10 days long, while the 2016 holiday will only be three days long. The terms of exempt items also differs between the two years. Manufacturing machinery and equipment: Getting rid of this tax was another Scott promise, going back to his first term. The sales tax originally was cut back with a limited exemption in 2012, but the following year was suspended by legislators for three years. Starting in 2014, the tax would not apply through April 30, 2017. Scott pushed to make the suspension permanent and in 2016, the Legislature agreed. The Scott-O-Meter rated this a Promise Kept. College textbooks: Scott proposed making college textbooks exempt from sales tax, suggesting it would save the average student about $60 per year. The Legislature agreed to the exemption for the 2015-16 fiscal year, but it was not renewed in the 2016 session. Other tax cuts: Scott’s office did not include specific dollar figures for other tax breaks, fee changes and provisions that went down over the last two years. In 2015, the Legislature removed sales taxes on gun club membership fees, put a $60,000 cap on taxes for board repairs, and gave businesses tax credits for pollution cleanup and research, among other measures. For 2016, legislators gave veterans’ organizations an exemption on food and drink sales taxes, phased out an asphalt tax over three years for government projects, and tinkered with taxes on cruise ship alcohol and tobacco sales, pear cider, and aviation fuel, among other changes. That’s just a sample of the tax changes over the last two years that Scott’s office counted. The figures are in the ballpark and add up somewhere north of $1 billion. Whether he can take credit for the total is a tougher question. Experts have told us that counting on things like tax credits and sales tax holidays means consumers have to spend money first before enjoying any benefits. Many of these changes also are temporary or narrowly focused. And remember that local governments may have to raise taxes to account for a change in revenue. Meanwhile, the Legislature has balked at several tax changes Scott has wanted, including eliminating the state’s corporate income tax — a major Scott request in 2016 that would have cost the state $770 million annually — and phasing out the sales tax on commercial leases. Our ruling Scott said, "Over the past two years, Florida has cut more than $1 billion in taxes." The figures are pretty accurate compared to state estimates for tax changes during 2015 and 2016. But there’s some question whether you can really consider all of the measures tax cuts. While some of the alterations are permanent, many of them are temporary exemptions or target very specific beneficiaries. Scott also has to ignore some of his earlier proposals and count a plan for education funding that is the opposite of what he wanted to top the $1 billion mark. The statement is accurate but needs some clarification. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-12472	Says Tammy Baldwin was told by a whistleblower about "overmedicated veterans," she made "deadly mistakes" and "three veterans died" at the Tomah VA hospital.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/may/05/americas-pac/super-pac-attack-blaming-tammy-baldwin-deaths-3-ve/	When seeking re-election in 2018, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin could be vulnerable to criticism of how she responded to an opioid painkiller scandal at the Tomah VA Medical Center in western Wisconsin. But an attack ad from Americas PAC that began airing April 27, 2017 claims Baldwin was told by a whistleblower about "overmedicated veterans" at Tomah and made "deadly mistakes" that left three veterans dead. The first-term Wisconsin Democrat has said her office made mistakes in handling a key inspection report about the Tomah VA and emails from a whistleblower. But that’s different than making mistakes that were deadly to three veterans. One death occurred years after the veteran ended his treatment at the Tomah VA and another had nothing to do with overmedication. As for the third veteran, Jason Simcakoski, Baldwin had requested investigations into the Tomah prescription practices before Simcakoski overdosed at the facility. And although Baldwin was slow to respond to emails from a whistleblower, those emails weren’t received until after Simakoski’s death. The ad Americas PAC is an Iowa-based super PAC that can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to advocate for or against political candidates. It is largely funded by Republican Richard Uihlein, co-founder of Uline, a Wisconsin shipping and packaging supplies distributor. Another Uihlein-supported super PAC, also eyeing 2018, previously attacked Baldwin with a claim we rated Mostly False about funding U.S. military troops. As for the Americas PAC attack, we’re presenting the entire script of its radio ad to show how sound bites, spliced with narration, connect Baldwin to the the deaths. Newscast audio: New developments tonight in a Wisconsin VA hospital investigation. Senator Tammy Baldwin -- Newscast audio: -- and investigating claims of a cover-up involving one Senate Democrat. Narrator: A whistleblower went to Democrat Sen. Tammy Baldwin for help protecting disabled veterans. Newscast audio: Senator Tammy Baldwin learned of the allegations that the patients were being overmedicated. Narrator: And Tammy Baldwin was slow to take action. Talk show audio: -- critical of Senator Baldwin of having a delayed reaction to the March report. Narrator: When disabled veterans were counting on her, Tammy Baldwin blinked. Interviewer audio: Did your office drop the ball? Baldwin audio clip: Mistakes were made. Narrator: Deadly mistakes. Three disabled veterans died. Newscast audio: -- after the deaths of three patients at a VA hospital. Narrator: When facing security challenges from Russia, China and ISIS, will Tammy Baldwin make another mistake? Now let's look at the three deaths. Two of the deaths The Tomah VA and how politicians responded to problems there have been in the news since January 2015, when the California-based Center for Investigative Reporting exposed the overprescription of opioid drugs by the facility. The day after the Baldwin attack ad began airing, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that two Wisconsin radio stations had pulled the ad after lawyers for Baldwin’s campaign complained it was false. Tom Donelson of Americas PAC told the Journal Sentinel and us that the committee stands by the ad. But two of the three deaths clearly don’t support the attack on Baldwin: Jacob Ward had been heavily medicated at the Tomah VA and later became a drug addict. But his parents said his care at Tomah ended in 2007 and they transferred him to the Milwaukee VA in 2008 and that they didn’t blame the Tomah VA for his death. Ward, who was 27, overdosed on heroin and cocaine in a Milwaukee apartment on Sept. 4, 2013. That was six years after he stopped going to Tomah and a year before the whistleblower contacted Baldwin. Thomas Patrick Baer, 74, died Jan. 14, 2015 at a hospital in La Crosse, Wis., two days after he suffered two strokes at the Tomah VA while waiting for treatment there. His death was not connected to overmedication. That leaves Simcakoski, who suffered a fatal drug overdose in the psychiatric ward of the Tomah VA. He had been prescribed 15 drugs, including muscle relaxants, tranquilizers, antipsychotic medicines and an opioid painkiller. Let’s look at a timeline of his case and how it relates to Baldwin, based primarily on Gannett Wisconsin Media news reports. Jason Simcakoski Between April and June of 2014, Baldwin wrote letters to the Tomah VA director, a VA official in Washington and the VA inspector general in Washington. She asked each of them to investigate allegations that "a large percentage of veterans" at the Tomah VA were being treated for abuse of opioids and other drugs that had originally been prescribed by the facility -- and that continued to be prescribed to them. The allegations were made by a constituent who wanted to remain anonymous, according to the letters. That means Baldwin had taken those steps months before the Simcakoski’s death, which occurred on Aug. 30, 2014. Moreover, Ryan Honl, the whistleblower alluded to in the radio ad, didn’t make a complaint to Baldwin’s office until nearly a month later. Baldwin nevertheless has been criticized because she took no action between Aug. 29, 2014 -- the day before Simcakoski’s death, when her office received an inspection report documenting the overprescribing of opioids at Tomah -- and January 2015, when the Center for Investigative Reporting revealed the circumstances of his death and Baldwin called for an investigation. In between, Honl had repeatedly emailed Baldwin’s office asking that Baldwin call for an investigation and make the inspection report public. Baldwin later said she was disciplining her chief of staff and two other aides for failing to take appropriate action on complaints about Tomah. And she said her office made mistakes in handling the inspection report and the whistleblower’s pleas. Still, Baldwin didn’t receive the inspection report until the day before Simcakoski’s death and the whistleblower didn’t begin contacting her until after Simcakoski’s death. Our rating Americas PAC says Baldwin was told by a whistleblower about "overmedicated veterans," she made "deadly mistakes" and "three veterans died" at the Tomah VA hospital. Baldwin has acknowledged mistakes in the handling of an inspection report and a whistle blower’s emails about veterans being over prescribed opioid painkillers at Tomah. But none of those tie Baldwin to the deaths. One death had nothing to do with overmedication. One was an overdose, but it occurred in Milwaukee years after the veteran stopped being treated in Tomah and before the whistleblower contacted Baldwin. And the third death, though an overdose at the Tomah VA, also occurred before the whistleblower contacted Baldwin (and only one day after she received the inspection report). We rate the statement False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Related fact check: The attack on Baldwin is along the lines of one made against Democrat Russ Feingold, who ran unsuccessfully against Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson in 2016. A super PAC claimed that when Feingold was in the Senate, he received a memo in 2009 that "outlined veteran harm" at the Tomah VA "and nothing was done." Our rating was False, as there was no evidence Feingold received the memo.	None	Americas PAC	None	None	None	2017-05-05T05:00:00	2017-04-27	['None']
pomt-13044	"Study after study have shown that sanctuary cities do not lead to an increase in crime because of the presence of people that are undocumented."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/nov/28/javier-m-gonzales/santa-fe-mayor-defends-sanctuary-cities-says-studi/	Mayors across America are doubling down on their cities’ decisions to serve as a "sanctuary" for immigrants living in the country illegally, despite President-elect Donald Trump’s promise to cut federal funding. Javier Gonzales, mayor of Santa Fe, N.M., appeared on Fox News recently defending his city’s stance to not assist federal officials with immigration enforcement. Megyn Kelly, host of Fox News’ The Kelly File, asked Gonzales about criticism directed at cities like Santa Fe, claiming that "sanctuary cities" attract criminals. Gonzales said his city prioritizes going after people who commit violent crimes, regardless of their immigration status. There’s also evidence that sanctuary cities aren’t a magnet for crime, he said. "Study after study have shown that sanctuary cities do not lead to an increase in crime because of the presence of people that are undocumented," Gonzales said Nov. 16. Is that true? 'Sanctuary cities' Despite the name, a sanctuary city is not always a city, it can be a town, county or other jurisdiction. There isn’t a federal law defining sanctuary locations, but the term is generally applied to places that have policies or ordinances limiting their assistance to federal immigration authorities who seek to apprehend and deport immigrants in the country illegally. The modern-day sanctuary concept stems from the 1980s when churches opened their doors to shelter Central Americans who fled violence in their countries and lived illegally in the United States, fearing deportation. The New Sanctuary Movement rolled out in 2007 as places of worship across the country became a refuge for immigrants facing deportation. There are at least 50 congregations across the United States offering sanctuary. Churches, schools, hospitals and public demonstrations such as rallies and parades are considered by immigration officials as sensitive locations, where enforcement actions are generally avoided but can take place with approval from a supervisor or under "exigent circumstances." The exact number of jurisdictions deemed sanctuary cities fluctuates as places adopt or abandon policies. The specifics of the policies also vary from place to place. The mayor of New Orleans, for instance, says the term "sanctuary city" does not apply to his city, but some critics say it has practices that parallel policies in other places that openly embrace the title, the Times-Picayune reported. Lena Graber, a special projects attorney for the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, estimated there are more than 500 counties and 38 cities with policies not to assist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Federal laws say state and local governments or officers may not prohibit the maintenance or exchange of individuals' immigration records with other local, state or federal entities, according to a 2009 Congressional Research Service report. However, if jurisdictions don't ask individuals about their immigration status, then they don't have the information that could potentially be kept and shared, the report said. Supporters of sanctuary cities say not questioning people about their immigration status builds trust between police and the community, encouraging residents to report crime. If an undocumented immigrant gets arrested for a non-immigration offense, they can still be charged, tried and convicted for that crime, Graber said. Opponents contend that sanctuary cities attract illegal immigration and undermine enforcement of the law. Any crime by someone in the country illegally is a crime that could have been avoided by having removed that person, said Ira Mehlman, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which seeks to reduce immigration levels. What studies show The Santa Fe mayor’s office sent over multiple studies that found immigrants are less prone to commit crime than people born in the United States. They also highlighted a report by the American Immigration Council, a pro-immigrant group, saying that held true for immigrants here legally and illegally. But there isn’t a lot of research specific to sanctuary cities and their impact on crime, experts said. Sanctuary ordinances have been around for more than 30 years, but only until recently have social scientists been able to study their effect on crime rates, said Elizabeth F. Cohen, an associate professor of political science at Syracuse University. A 2009 study out of the University of California, Berkeley School of Law cites Austin, Texas, as an example where cooperation between immigrant communities and law enforcement led to an increase in crime reporting and lower crime levels. Other examples of decreases in crime due to immigrant-friendly policies are also cited in this 2012 study. Research also suggests that crime reporting -- especially in communities with a high proportion of immigrants -- is very likely negatively impacted when immigration enforcement practices are carried out by local officials, said Charis E. Kubrin, a criminology professor at University of California, Irvine. A 2014 study by collaborators at University of Chicago and New York University on whether the immigration enforcement program known as Secure Communities reduced crime showed there was no significant rise in crime in sanctuary cities during the program’s rollout, Cohen said. Under the program (which has been replaced), when someone was booked into a police station or jail, that person’s information was sent to the FBI and Department of Homeland Security, ultimately to figure out the person’s immigration record. More recently, researchers at the University of California at Riverside and Highline College found sanctuary policies do not affect crime rates either way. The study included analysis of violent crime, property crime and rape. "Sanctuary policies in terms of leading to crime do not appear to be a problem," the October 2016 study said. "In fact ... almost all research that assesses links between immigration and criminality find an inverse relationship." Trump campaigned against sanctuary policies by bringing up incidents of undocumented immigrants in these cities committing violent crimes, such as the alleged shooting by a Mexican national of Kathryn Steinle in San Francisco. But we did not turn up evidence of sanctuary cities leading to an increase in crime. Qualitative information on sanctuary practices suggests they are beneficial to criminal law enforcement practices, said Phil Torrey, a lecturer on law with the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinical Program and supervising attorney for the Harvard Immigration Project. A rise in crime in a sanctuary city could be caused by factors unrelated to that city’s undocumented population, Torrey said. For instance, a city’s rising population can account for increased overall criminal arrests, he said. Our ruling Gonzales said, "Study after study have shown that sanctuary cities do not lead to an increase in crime because of the presence of people that are undocumented." The data behind Gonzales’ point about sanctuary cities is not conclusive or as extensive as he described. However, a recent study by academic researchers found that sanctuary policies have no effect on crime rates. Other studies have found a reduction in crime as a result of cooperation between immigrant communities and law enforcement. Scholars also say immigrants, including those in the country illegally, are less likely to commit crimes than the native-born population. Gonzales' statement overstates the breadth of research on this topic but is on the right track.

pomt-09747	Other Western countries have ended their "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policies.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/12/carl-levin/levin-claims-other-western-countries-have-lifted-t/	President Barack Obama has repeatedly said that he plans to repeal the military's "don't ask, don't tell" rule, which prevents openly gay and lesbian people from serving in the military. But so far, no go. Meet the Press host David Gregory asked Michigan Democrat Carl Levin, who chairs the Senate's Armed Services Committee, whether Obama would follow through on his promise. "I think he will and he can," Levin said on the program on Oct. 11, 2009. "I think it has to be done in the right way, which is to get a buy-in from the military, which I think is now possible. Other militaries in the West, the British and other Western armies, have ended this discriminatory policy. We can do it successfully." Before we dig into Levin's claim that other Western countries have already repealed similar policies, some background: On the campaign trail, Obama wrote an open letter to the LGBT — lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender — community, stating that, as president, he would "bring about real change for all LGBT Americans." Chief among his efforts would be a repeal of the military's rule, one that was put into place during the Clinton administration. That's easier said than done, however. Obama cannot simply undo "don't ask, don't tell" — it must be repealed by Congress. So, when Defense Secretary Robert Gates said in March 2009 that the administration was not actively pursuing a rule change, we gave Obama a Stalled on our Obameter for his promise to overturn the policy. The issue was back in the news Oct. 11 when Obama spoke at a gathering of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender civil rights organization. He told the group: "I'm working with the Pentagon, its leadership and the members of the House and Senate on ending this policy." Levin hopes the policy will change. To underscore his optimism, he pointed out that the United States wouldn't be the first country to repeal laws banning gays from the military. Australia ended its ban on homosexuals in the military in 1992, as did Canada. Levin is also right that Britain does not prohibit gays and lesbians from serving. Its ban was lifted in 2000, when the European Court of Human Rights settled a two-year legal battle involving four homosexual service members. All told, at least 25 Western countries have no ban on gays and lesbians in the military, according to the Palm Center, a public policy think tank associated with the University of California at Santa Barbara. As of June 2009, that list includes Germany, Austria, Spain, Finland and France. So, Levin is correct that other Western countries, including Britain, have ended policies that prevent gays and lesbians from serving openly. We give him a True.

pomt-08891	When Obama went to Pakistan in 1981, he could not have been traveling as a U.S. citizen.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/30/chain-email/e-mail-says-obama-had-have-been-traveling-another-/	In an effort to prove that Barack Obama is not eligible to be president, birthers have come up with some very creative arguments. A curious reader forwarded a chain e-mail that made an interesting claim. "Pakistan was on the U.S. State Department's 'no travel' list in 1981," read the e-mail. Therefore, "when Obama went to Pakistan in 1981 he was traveling either with a British passport or an Indonesian passport." The most effective chain e-mails, like the best lies, are built on an incorrect but seemingly plausible "fact" that they follow to what seems like a sound conclusion. In this case, the "fact" on which the entire argument rests is that Pakistan was on a "no travel" list in 1981. If that were true, Obama would either have had to use a different passport or enter the country illegally and request his passport not be stamped, as some Americans have done over the years to travel to Cuba. Obama has said he traveled to Pakistan in 1981. He was on summer vacation from college, and, after visiting his mother in Indonesia, he traveled to Pakistan with a college friend. However, according to the U.S. Department of State, the department in charge of issuing travel bans, Pakistan had a green light for adventurous U.S. citzens. "According to our Pakistan experts," said Ivna Giauque, a public affairs officer at the State Department, "there was no travel ban to Pakistan in 1981." Without the original premise that Pakistan had a travel ban, the rest of the argument deteriorates. The author of the e-mail may have been confusing a travel warning or travel advisory with a travel ban. The University of Illinois at Chicago Library has an archive of State Department documents, including one from Aug. 17, 1981, issuing a travel advisory for Pakistan. It is the oldest travel advisory document in the archive related to Pakistan. Even if Obama traveled after the advisory was issued instead of earlier in the summer, the State Department confirmed it wasn't illegal. Our good friends at Snopes and Factcheck.org found a travel article about visiting Pakistan published in the New York Times in June 1981, and it mentions nothing about such travel being illegal. An August 1981 letter to the editor in the New York Times by the U.S. Consul General in Lahore, Pakistan, encouraged people to come visit. We also found an ad in the New York Times from March which listed Karachi and Lahore as two destinations in their travel package. In 1981, travel to Pakistan was not illegal or prohibited. Somebody was just looking for an excuse to promote the birther conspiracy, so we rate it Pants On Fire.

pomt-11930	"A California health care CEO is promising to reduce our prescription drug costs."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2017/oct/13/ohioans-against-deceptive-rx-ballot-issue/ad-opposing-ohio-issue-2-wrongly-portrays-proponen/	A TV advertisement opposing Ohio’s Issue 2 ballot initiative to lower drug costs portrayed the initiative as a ploy by the health care industry to hike up costs. "Over the next few months, you’re going to hear a lot about the November ballot issue on prescription drugs," the May 23, 2017, video says. "A California health care CEO is promising to reduce our prescription drug costs. It sounds too good to be true, because it is." They went on to list a number of associations opposing the ballot initiative because they "believe it could increase drug costs for millions of Ohioans." If approved on Nov. 7, Issue 2 would require all drugs bought by the state -- whether for Medicaid or other state programs -- to match Veterans Affairs prices, which receive a 24 percent discount off market price in addition to sometimes undisclosed rebates. The idea is that it would lower the state’s health care costs. Whether or not the ballot initiative can achieve its goal -- or the opposite -- is contested, as we wrote about in another fact-check. For this check, we wanted to know if the person behind the initiative was indeed a health care CEO. His title is complicated, but the ad’s message is misleading. Notably, the video failed to mention that the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a trade association representing drugmakers, was behind the opposition campaign. The ad attacks Michael Weinstein, the president and co-founder of the Los Angeles-based AIDS Healthcare Foundation, the biggest AIDS-fighting organization in the world. And he’s behind both this ballot initiative and a similar one in California. "Both the New York Times and the LA Times have referred to Mr. Weinstein as the CEO of his organization — AHF — which is clearly a health care organization," Dale Butland, a spokesman for the opposition campaign, told us. "Indeed, the New York Times Magazine profile of Mr. Weinstein was titled 'The CEO of HIV.' " Christopher Glazek, the author of the New York Times Magazine story, said the title of the piece was intended as "arch." "It's a nonprofit, and his official title isn't CEO," Glazek said. The organization derives its revenues from a network of pharmacies and clinics that provide care to mostly government-insured patients. The excess income goes to provide free care to more than 773,000 H.I.V. patients worldwide. Weinstein’s annual report showed a salary of $400,000, which Glazek characterized as "low for directors of similarly sized nonprofits." Christine Mai-Duc, who co-wrote the Los Angeles Times article, said, "He is referred to as the ‘chief executive’ in a photo caption in our story, not in the story itself." However, she noted that a follow-up story referred to him as the foundation’s "top executive." The group that favors the initiative said the description of Glazek is just wrong, and it’s politically motivated. "I think calling him a health care CEO would be disingenuous if it were banal, but considering they are in the process of character assassination, then it is wrong that drug company CEOs are spending money from excessive profits to try to label him as one of them," said Dennis Willard, a spokesman for Ohio Taxpayers for Lower Drug Prices. The drug lobby PhRMA has so far outspent the AIDS Foundation roughly 5 to 1, according to the Columbus Dispatch. Our ruling An ad against Ohio’s Issue 2 ballot initiative said, "A California health care CEO is promising to reduce our prescription drug costs." Weinstein is the president and co-founder of AIDS Healthcare Foundation, a nonprofit funding Issue 2, but the articles cited by the campaign referred to Weinstein as a CEO either in jest or in a photo caption. His organization deals with health care and he is indeed its top executive, but the ad makes it seem as though he represents the drug industry, which is actually true of the ad makers. It’s the national association for pharmaceutical companies that opposes the ballot measure. We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-13813	Says no one from the Bush family attended the 2012 Republican National Convention and "there was no President Bush" at the 2008 convention.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/17/reince-priebus/priebus-wrongly-says-no-bush-attended-2012-rnc/	Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus is confident the Cleveland RNC will be a success, even without a Bush in attendance. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and former presidents George W. and George H.W. Bush all declined to participate or attend the 2016 nominating convention. Meet the Press host Chuck Todd offered the decision of the Bush family to spurn the 2016 convention as evidence that this year’s event will be a little different. "You’re not showcasing the best parts of your party," Todd said to Priebus, adding "it is unusual not to have a Bush at the convention." Priebus responded: "It didn’t happen four years ago" at the 2012 RNC in Tampa. Priebus added after some back-and-forth that that "there was no President Bush" at the RNC in 2008. Claims about the pre-eminence of the Bush family in Republican politics have come up before. We previously rated True a claim that Republicans haven’t won an election without a Bush or Nixon since 1928. In this case we wondered if Priebus was right that the Bush family eschewed the RNC in some form in 2012 and 2008. He wasn’t. The 2012 convention It’s been nearly eight years since a Bush has held national elected office, but the family has maintained a role at the nominating convention. Since 1980, every Republican convention has seen a Bush speak — often as the vice presidential or presidential nominee. That includes the 2012 convention in Tampa, which saw the nomination of Mitt Romney. Jeb Bush addressed delegates at the convention, as this video confirms. He touted his love for his brother, criticized President Barack Obama’s record and discussed children and education. "If we want to continue to be the greatest nation on the planet, we must give our kids what we promised them — an equal opportunity," he said. "That starts in the classroom. It starts in our communities. It starts where you live and it starts with nominating Mitt Romney the next president of the United States." 2000, 2004 and 2008 Priebus also contended in his interview with Todd that there was no "President Bush" at the 2008 RNC in St. Paul, Minn. That’s not entirely correct, either. President George W. Bush addressed convention delegates live from the White House. Bush told convention delegates that he remained in Washington to oversee recovery efforts related to Hurricane Gustav. Bush, however, praised GOP nominee Arizona Sen. John McCain. "He is ready to lead this nation," Bush said. "From the day of his commissioning John McCain was a respected Naval officer who made decisions on which the lives of others depended." First Lady Laura Bush spoke live from the convention, which also included appearances by former President George H.W. Bush and former First Lady Barbara Bush, video from the event shows. George W. Bush, the 2004 GOP nominee, of course spoke at the New York City 2004 convention as well, as did Laura Bush. Same for 2000 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 1980, 1984, 1988, 1992 and 1996 The list goes on. Former president George H.W. Bush spoke at the 1996 convention in San Diego, Calif., which eventually nominated former Kansas Sen. Bob Dole. George H.W. Bush spoke in Houston, Texas, for the 1992 convention, as part of his failed re-election campaign.The same goes for 1988, when he was named the Republican nominee for the first time. In 1984, George H. W. Bush was selected as the vice-presidential nominee (Ronald Reagan was nominated for president). The same thing happened in 1980, and Bush spoke on both occasions. The earliest convention we could find without a Bush speaking was in 1976, where Gerald Ford was selected as the Republican nominee. To recap, that’s at least 40 years and nine conventions where a Bush had a speaking role. And members of the Bush family definitely spoke at both the 2012 and 2008 conventions. Our ruling Priebus said it’s not a big deal a Bush isn’t attending the 2016 convention, because a Bush didn’t speak in 2012 and "there was no President Bush" at the 2008 convention. He’s wrong. Jeb Bush addressed delegates at the 2012 Republican National Convention in Tampa. In 2008, George W. Bush addressed delegates via a live video feed, but former President George H.W. Bush and former first ladies Laura and Barbara Bush all attended. A Bush has spoken at every RNC since at least 1980, we found.

pomt-00478	Says "43 of Joe’s legislative proposals have become law, including 21 since President Trump took office."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/aug/13/joe-donnelly/facts-behind-joe-donnellys-senate-effectiveness/	Joe Donnelly, incumbent senator running for re-election in Indiana, touted his effective lawmaking during a seven-day campaign trip around the state. "43 of Joe’s legislative proposals have become law, including 21 since President Trump took office," an Aug. 8 press release from the Donnelly campaign read. The campaign has repeated this figure time and again, on the road and in campaign statements. It contradicts, however, what President Donald Trump said about Donnelly, whom he dubbed "Sleepin’ Joe" during a May 11 campaign rally for Republican challenger Mike Braun. "The Center for Effective Lawmaking named Joe Donnelly the least effective Democrat lawmaker in the United States Senate," Trump said. "He's never sponsored a bill that has become a law." So who’s right? In a way, both are correct. The Center for Effective Lawmaking, a nonpartisan research project run by two political science professors, assigns credit based on who is the sponsor of a bill, as recorded by the Library of Congress. Based on that definition, Donnelly has never sponsored a bill that became a law during his first term in the Senate. That doesn’t mean none of his legislative proposals in the Senate have become law. Craig Volden, who co-directs the center, noted that the criteria for advancing a legislative proposal could be broadened. A closer search of the Library of Congress database shows 28 bills that became law on which Donnelly was among the co-sponsors. He was an original co-sponsor, a higher bar, on five of these. Language from Donnelly’s bills, and from amendments he proposed, have also made their way into law, mostly through annual budget acts. In all, these add up to 43 total and 17 under Trump. For example, Donnelly introduced a bill in 2013 to improve suicide prevention efforts in the military. The bill didn’t get far on its own, but Donnelly got the proposal passed in the National Defense Authorization Act in 2014 as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. More recently, Donnelly helped author Right to Try, a bill aimed at getting drugs that had not been FDA-approved to terminally ill patients. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., was the sponsor of the bill, so Donnelly didn’t get that credit on Congress.gov — but Johnson gave it to him at a press conference. "My primary co-sponsor, Sen. Donnelly, was a stalwart," Johnson said. "This would not have happened without Joe Donnelly." Volden said that while valid measures of effectiveness, "there is no similar comprehensive measure of the other senators in this regard that would allow a systematic comparison and ranking of senators on these criteria." Experts told us being in the minority in a divided Congress makes it harder for Donnelly to have gotten much passed anyway. Donnelly took office in 2013, and Democrats held the majority until 2015. "As you can see, passing the version he sponsors would let him claim credit easily — incorporating it elsewhere would not," said Corrine McConnaughy, political science professor at George Washington University. "Partisans busy undermining each other absolutely may seek ways to prevent credit-claiming by the other party's members." That said, Donnelly has demonstrated willingness to cross the aisle. The Lugar Center's Bipartisan Index (named for former Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind.) measures the frequency with which a member gets co-sponsors for their bills from the other party and the frequency with which they co-sponsor bills introduced by the other party. They ranked Donnelly fourth among senators and first among Democratic senators. Our ruling Donnelly’s campaign said, "43 of Joe’s legislative proposals have become law, including 21 since President Trump took office." None of those were the bills he sponsored on his own that became law. But in a gridlocked Congress, that’s not unusual for a senator in the minority. Instead, Donnelly co-sponsored bills, wrote amendments and crafted language that made its way into 43 laws during his single Senate term. We rate this statement Mostly True.

pomt-05740	There are "a larger number of shark attacks in Florida than there are cases of voter fraud."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2012/mar/02/aclu-florida/shark-attacks-are-more-common-voter-fraud-florida/	On March 1, 2012, Comedy Central’s Stephen Colbert moved in on Florida’s controversial new election law for a recurring segment, "People Who Are Destroying America." The target: a Panhandle teacher named Dawn Quarles, who turned in 76 voter registration forms from her students beyond the state’s new 48-hour deadline. She could face a $1,000 fine. One of the people Colbert interviewed for his sarcastic report is Howard Simon, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida. Florida officials claimed they needed to pass the law to prevent voter fraud, but these cases are actually pretty rare, he said. "There are probably a larger number of shark attacks in Florida than there are cases of voter fraud," he said. We couldn’t resist diving in: Are there more shark attacks than cases of voter fraud in Florida? We compiled this chart using data from the Florida Department of State, which monitors elections, and the Florida Museum of Natural History in Gainesville, which has a renowned ichthyology department. (Ichthyology is the study of fish.) The shark attack figures include documented instances of sharks attacking human victims. The voter fraud cases indicate the number of cases deemed legally sufficient for an investigation by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. FLORIDA 2008 2009 2010 2011 Total Sharks attacks 28 19 14* 11 72 Voter fraud cases 16 9 10 14 49 *includes one fatal attack If we were considering 2011 alone, when voter fraud cases exceeded shark attacks, this could have been ruled False. But spreading our data out over four years shows shark attacks happen more frequently than voter fraud cases. Florida regularly leads the country in unprovoked shark attacks. In 2011, Florida’s 11 attacks comprised 38 percent of the nation’s total and 15 percent of the world’s attacks. Volusia County, home to the spring-break mecca of Daytona Beach, had the most attacks (six). While the shark attack figures are cut and dry (sorry!), the voter fraud numbers are not. There could be more cases than we know about, involving more people. The numbers may not represent total voter fraud cases, as those could be handled by local supervisors and state attorneys. Also, one "case" may represent multiple counts of voter fraud, perpetrated by multiple people, said agency spokesman Chris Cate. He points to a November 2011 case that resulted in the arrests of nine people from the North Florida town of Madison, including the supervisor of elections. On the other hand, the fraud list does not count only convictions. So some of these cases could be proven unfounded. The ACLU’s claim is true on its face, but we’re knocking it down a peg with consideration of a few things. One, the state’s count doesn’t represent a complete set of possible fraud being prosecuted in the state. Two, a "case" does not always include just one instance of fraud. Using the Madison case as an example, we know nine people were arrested in just one case. We rate this Mostly True.

pomt-02971	"Wendy Davis opposes any limits on abortion."	false	/texas/statements/2013/oct/22/texas-right-life/davis-says-she-opposes-late-term-abortions-certain/	The day state Sen. Wendy Davis announced her run for governor, Texas Right to Life announced it would air a radio ad calling her an "abortion zealot." Audio that the anti-abortion group released Oct. 3, 2013, of its ad said, "Wendy Davis opposes any limits on abortion." That’s a clear-cut statement, which the group also had on its website. An Oct. 3, 2013, entry on the site said that Davis’s "views are so fanatical that she opposes any safeguards for the unborn at any stage of pregnancy, up to and including the final weeks before birth… (Davis) thoroughly aired her abortion views during her 11-hour filibuster in June in her failed attempt to block the new Pro-Life law from passing." A spokeswoman for the group, Melissa Conway, told us by phone that her group could not immediately provide backup information. Davis, a Fort Worth Democrat, was indelibly linked to abortion issues by her June 25, 2013, filibuster, which made headlines worldwide and briefly helped derail changes in law intended to restrict abortions. Campaign spokesman Bo Delp told us by email it’s incorrect to say Davis opposes any limits. "Like most Texans, Sen. Davis opposes late-term abortions except when the life or health of the mother is endangered, in cases of rape or incest or in the case of severe and irreversible fetal abnormalities," Delp said. Delp’s response fits with an Oct. 5, 2013, news story in the Austin American-Statesman saying that Davis, while addressing the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., Aug. 5, 2013, was asked, "Could you discuss what legal limits on abortion you do support?" She replied, "You know, the Supreme Court has made that decision. And it’s one of the protected liberties under our Constitution. And I respect the constitutional protections that are in place today." The Supreme Court’s 1973 landmark decision in Roe v Wade struck down a Texas law that banned all abortions except those performed to save the mother’s life. The justices ruled then that states can’t restrict or ban abortions in the first trimester (roughly three months or the first 12 weeks of the pregnancy). Their ruling said, though, that states can make laws governing abortions in the second trimester if the laws are "reasonably related" to the woman’s health. After the point at which fetuses attain "viability," meaning they can survive outside the womb, states can limit or ban abortions unless the woman’s life is in danger, the court held. So in her response in Washington, Davis signaled that she both accepts letting states limit abortions after the first trimester and limit or ban abortions after fetuses are viable, unless the mother’s life is at risk. Elected to the Senate in 2008, Davis voted in 2009 and 2011 against state legislation requiring women to get sonograms before having an abortion. The measure passed into law in 2011 requires doctors performing abortions to provide a sonogram 24 hours before the abortion and describe what the image shows, including the fetus' size, body features and internal organs. Her 2013 filibuster delayed, but didn’t prevent the Republican-majority Legislature from approving restrictions that will soon begin taking effect. Starting Oct. 29, 2013, the law bans abortions after the 20th week post-fertilization, except when the woman’s life is endangered or in cases of severe fetal abnormality; requires abortion doctors to gain admitting privileges in a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic; and beefs up regulations on the dispensing of abortion-inducing drugs. Starting Sept. 1, 2014, the law requires that all abortion clinics meet the same standards as ambulatory surgical centers. In its October news story, the Statesman quoted a Davis adviser as saying that Davis would not have picked a fight over the 20-week provision by itself. However, she indicated in the early part of her filibuster that she was opposed to that provision on medical grounds. "From our medical community, we’ve heard the concern that this interferes with the practice of medicine," Davis said, according to CounterPath Press’ transcript of the filibuster. "As important, we know that concerns have been raised that this ban interferes with a woman’s health care decision before she and her doctor may have important health information about her own health and the health of the pregnancy." Repeatedly during the filibuster, Davis said that a major reason she opposed the legislation was that in her view, its provisions were not intended to make women safer but to make sure fewer abortions were performed. "I think that the state of Texas has already established a fine standard of care," she said. Our ruling Texas Right to Life said, "Wendy Davis opposes any limits on abortion." Although Davis has spoken and voted against certain abortion limits, her campaign statement and her stated support for the Roe v. Wade decision indicate she opposes late-term abortions except in extreme circumstances. The group did not provide, and we did not find, evidence of Davis opposing "any limits on abortion." We rate this claim as False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-08885	When Atlanta Police Chief George Turner was interim head of the department, overall crime fell 14 percent and violent crime dropped 22.7 percent.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2010/aug/01/kasim-reed/atlanta-mayor-said-city-posted-big-crime-drops-whe/	George Turner won his post as Atlanta police chief after a whirlwind of accomplishment. By the time Mayor Kasim Reed announced Turner's nomination July 9, the veteran city cop had spent seven months as the department's interim leader. Under his command, officers were closing more cases, Reed said. Recruitment was up. Best of all, crime was down. Way down. Overall, it dropped 14 percent from the same period last year, according to a July 9 press release from the mayor's office announcing Turner's selection. Property crime sank 12.3 percent. And the reduction in violent crime was even more dramatic, according to the press release: 22.7 percent. That's why Reed decided he needed to keep Turner as head of the Atlanta Police Department, the release said. "The results we are seeing suggest we are moving in the right direction and I want to build on the progress we have made," the release quoted Reed as saying. The City Council approved Turner unanimously last Tuesday. A nearly 23 percent drop in violent crime? PolitiFact Georgia decided to take a deeper look. Reducing crime was one of Reed's central campaign promises. He tapped Turner to help him fulfill it. Nationally, crime is at historic lows. Violent crime dropped across the country by 5.5 percent in 2009, according to Federal Bureau of Investigation figures. In Atlanta last year, it fell 14 percent. Police don't control broad crime-producing factors such as city demographics or the economy, but researchers have demonstrated that certain law enforcement strategies can cut crime. The mayor's press release gives the impression that the crime calculations are based upon a monthly report compiled by Atlanta police with data that they send to the FBI. The FBI uses the numbers to issue the agency's Uniform Crime Reports (UCR), which give yearly and semiannual snapshots of crime nationwide. The press release cited the UCR figures from April, about two months before Reed nominated Turner as the Atlanta's new chief. A PolitiFact Georgia analysis shows the mayor's crime numbers don't add up. The city's own figures don't match the press release. One problem is that the press release understated the actual drop in overall crime and property crime, which were 16 percent and 17 percent, according to the UCR data. The bigger problem is that the city overstated the drop in violent crime -- murders, rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults. It fell only 16 percent. That's about one-third less than the 22.7 percent the mayor took credit for. Violent crimes tend to worry people the most, so PolitiFact Georgia decided to do more checking. Police provided crime numbers to PolitiFact Georgia from their Command Operation Briefings to Revitalize Atlanta program. Commanders regularly use COBRA data to analyze crime trends. These numbers are slightly different from UCR figures because the FBI asks agencies to calculate crime in a very specific way. But if crime drops dramatically by one measure, the second should show a similar decrease. We reviewed the COBRA figures from Jan. 4, when Turner started as interim chief, through July 9, when Reed announced he wanted him to be the permanent head. They show overall and property crime were down by roughly the same amount as the release stated: 13 percent and 14 percent. But the news the COBRA figures held for violent crime was even worse than what the UCR indicated. That category dropped 11 percent. That's less than half what the mayor's office said. So why the major difference? The mayor's press release used a different set of figures: "rolling monthly averages," a spokeswoman said. It's a way of organizing data to smooth out unusual crime spikes or drops that can obscure an overall trend. For instance, to get December 2009's rolling monthly average, you'd average the UCR crime totals from January 2009 through December 2009. The mayor's office determined violent crime dropped 22.7 percent by comparing averages from April 2009 and April 2010. The problem is that April 2010 rolling monthly averages incorporate crime dynamics that were in play as far back as May 2009, well before Turner was interim chief. A spokeswoman for the mayor's office acknowledges they didn't use the proper figures and said they will in the future cite COBRA and UCR data when they discuss crime trends in public. The mayor's office also noted another problem: The 22.7 number was wrong. It should be a 16 percent decrease. After PolitiFact Georgia questioned City Hall about the numbers, they realized they entered the data incorrectly. Still, city spokeswoman Sonji Jacobs Dade said that this is a good-size decline. "We think those numbers really do represent a significant decrease in crime since January 2010," Dade said. Where does this leave us? The nearly 23 percent drop in violent crime was among Reed's key arguments for making Turner the city's new police chief. It appeared repeatedly in news accounts as evidence of his qualifications. If you zero in on the precise dates between Turner's appointment as interim chief and the announcement of his selection, violent crime dropped only 11 percent. Furthermore, the city acknowledged that the "rolling monthly average" method cited was not the most appropriate one to use when officials talk to the public about crime. Despite the city's mathematical errors, the fact remains that crime is down. But this doesn't erase the fact that the city got the violent crime statistic wrong. And it used the wrong type of data to begin with. We rate Reed's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Kasim Reed	None	None	None	2010-08-01T06:00:00	2010-07-09	['None']
pomt-07108	"When the union says I want to eliminate tenure, that’s not true."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jun/21/chris-christie/gov-chris-christie-says-he-doesnt-want-eliminate-t/	In the ongoing war of words between Gov. Chris Christie and the New Jersey Education Association, the governor is accusing the teachers union of distorting his proposals for tenure. "So when the union says I want to eliminate tenure that’s not true," Christie said during a speech to students and professors at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. "Here’s what I want to do with tenure. Based on this evaluation system I want to say after three years where you are judged either effective or highly effective you get tenure and then for every year thereafter where you are rated effective or highly effective you keep tenure and keep all the job protections that go along with tenure. But if you have two years in a row of partially effective or one year of ineffective you lose your tenure rights." Once a teacher loses tenure, Christie said, he or she could earn it again with "three consecutive years of being rated effective or highly effective." For this Truth-O-Meter item, we're assessing Christie's claim that his proposal does not abolish tenure. We found it hinges on how the word is defined. We need to begin by pointing out the governor's contradiction on the issue. In his State of the State address in January, the governor said, "the time to eliminate teacher tenure is now." But now, Christie says he does not want to eliminate tenure -- he wants teachers evaluated annually to keep it. But can that still be called tenure? No, said the NJEA. Spokesman Steve Baker said Christie’s proposal "is not tenure" because that’s not how tenure is defined by state statute. But Frank Belluscio, a spokesman for the New Jersey School Boards Association, which has been more supportive of Christie's proposal, had a more nuanced view. He called it "renewable tenure." A Christie spokesman declined to elaborate, but pointed us to a package of proposals that say they "fundamentally reform the state’s tenure system." The New Jersey statute that governs the requirements for tenure, 18A:28-5, states that after three consecutive years of employment with a school district, teachers "shall be under tenure during good behavior and efficiency and they shall not be dismissed or reduced in compensation except for inefficiency, incapacity, or conduct unbecoming such a teaching staff member or other just cause." So the law specifies that continued good behavior is necessary to keep tenure. Another statute states that when a school board reduces the number of teaching staff members, "dismissals … shall be made on the basis of seniority." We found that tenure means different things to different sources -- even dictionaries: Merriam-Webster: ". . . a status granted after a trial period to a teacher that gives protection from summary dismissal." Cambridge dictionary: " . . . the right to remain permanently in a job." Several other dictionaries say tenure is the holding of an office and a guarantee of permanent employment after a probationary period. The definition gets murkier when politics enter the fray. Christie pointedly defined tenure in his Harvard speech as "a job for life after three years and one day," a sarcastic line that suggests there is no process for dismissing teachers found to be incompetent. But Baker, the union spokesman, said, "Tenure is not a job for life. Never has been. Never intended to be ... Tenure is a fair dismissal process." PolitiFact New Jersey also contacted some professors for an independent take on whether Christie's plan can still be called tenure. The consensus was that Christie's plan dramatically changes the program, but that some aspects of tenure would remain in place. "Tenure is a status that one attains after a period of probation that grants someone the right to remain in that job given good performance and, of course, with due process," said Ada Beth Cutler, dean of the College of Education and Human Services at Montclair State University. "The tenure system as we know it now is going to be eliminated" if Christie’s proposals become law, she said. "But tenure isn’t going to be eliminated." Joseph DePierro, dean of Seton Hall’s College of Education and Human Services, called tenure "due process on steroids." He says the governor is "playing a funny game with tenure. It sort of eliminates it, but doesn’t quite eliminate it." Bruce Baker, an associate professor at the Rutgers Graduate School of Education and no relation to the NJEA’s Steve Baker, said tenure, as it exists, is "the assumption of ‘continuous contract’ given satisfactory performance of job duties." Whether or not Christie’s proposals change the definition of tenure, Bruce Baker wrote in an e-mail, "it certainly alters job security in significant ways, and does so with no counterbalancing proposal for significant increases in wages or other benefits." For Jeffrey Keefe, an associate professor at Rutgers University’s School of Management and Labor Relations and a research associate for the liberal Economic Policy Institute, the definition of tenure hinges on the "last in, first out" system, which would be eliminated under Christie's plan. "Once you take the seniority clause out, it falls out of my definition of tenure. It becomes pretty meaningless then," Keefe said. So to recap: There is no consensus. The dictionaries don’t agree. And Christie and the NJEA certainly aren’t on the same page. The only agreement is that Christie’s proposal eliminates tenure as it is now defined in New Jersey. Some said it's reasonable to call that a form of tenure, while others said the word doesn't apply any more. The governor said his plan doesn't eliminate tenure. But given that experts disagree about how to characterize his plan, we rate the governor’s statement Half True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-04512	Says Eric Cantor voted to assure Congress would be paid if the government shut down and against guaranteeing troops would be paid.	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2012/oct/04/wayne-powell/wayne-powell-says-eric-cantor-voted-protect-his-pa/	Wayne Powell, the Democratic challenger for the 7th Congressional District, portrayed incumbent Eric Cantor as serving his own interests during an Oct. 1 debate. Cantor, a Republican, is the majority leader of the House of Representatives. Powell held Cantor responsible for fueling a budget impasse with Democrats in April 2011 that came within a day of shutting down the government. Powell was emotional when his chance came to ask Cantor a prepared question. "This is for my son," he said. Powell’s son is an Army major who has served in Afghanistan. Then he turned to Cantor. "Last year when you and the president were in a budget standoff that threatened to shut down the federal government, you voted to continue paying members of Congress, including yourself, in the event of a shutdown," Powell told the majority leader. "At the same time, you voted against a bill which would have -- it would ensure -- that members of the armed services continue to get paid. "My question is this, Eric: How could you in good conscience vote to continue your own pay but, at the same vote to stop paying our servicemen and women that you voted to send into combat in Afghanistan?" We decided to check Powell’s facts, which Cantor said were wrong. Powell’s campaign backed the claim by pointing us to two procedural votes held during heated debates on spending. We’ll take a look at each. Military pay On April 7, 2011, President Barack Obama and Republican leaders were in tense budget negotiations one day before a government shutdown deadline. The GOP was demanding billions in spending cuts in return for passing an appropriations bill. Obama vowed to veto any legislation that contained what he said were harsh GOP demands for cuts in social programs and an end to federal funding for Planned Parenthood. The Republican-led House sought to ease the pressure that day by proposing a one-week appropriations bill. The legislation would have funded the Department of Defense for a longer time -- through the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. Republicans called the measure a "troop funding bill." Democrats were not to be outdone. During floor debate, they said there was no guarantee Obama would sign the measure. Rep. Bill Owens, D-N.Y., offered an amendment that would ensure troops would continue to be paid if the government closed. Owens never explained how he expected to protect military pay by offering an amendment to a bill he said was likely to be vetoed. Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky., denounced the motion as "purely a political gesture." Rogers said the GOP bill, which he sponsored, already provided "the essential funds for our men and women who are in harm’s way." Cantor voted against Owens’ motion, along with all but one Republican. But he was in the 247-181 majority, including 15 Democrats, who voted for the underlying bill. So did Cantor really vote against a bill that would have ensured troops get paid, as Powell said? No. Congressional pay On April 1, 2011, House Republicans passed a bill directing that its version of budget become law if the Senate did not act on it by April 6. This appeared to violate the U.S. Constitution, which says that both chambers must approve bills before they can become law. The measure included a provision that would deny pay to members of Congress and the president if a shutdown occurred. This was major public relations point because members of Congress get paid during a shutdown, while most other federal employees do not. Some Republicans pointed out that, under the constitution, congressional pay cannot be reduced in the middle of a term. To allay concerns, other Republicans suggested they could be paid retroactively when the shutdown ended, like the rest of the federal workforce. Democrats upped the stakes, seeking an amendment that would bar retro payments to Congress. Then they got a surprise. Rep. Dan Lungren, R-Calif., revealed an email he had received from Obama’s Department of Justice questioning the constitutionality of the Democrats’ motion. The amendment was defeated on a partisan 236-187 vote. Cantor and all but one Republican voted against it. Cantor then voted for the underlying bill, which included the problematic ban on paying Congress during a shutdown. It passed the House but died in the Senate. Both measures -- as dubious as they were -- were attempts to erase the pay protection for congress members in the event of a government shutdown. So to say Cantor was out to protect his paycheck is a big stretch. A final note The Democratic amendments at issue were "motions to recommit," a prerogative of the minority party since the 1st Congress. They are motions, often procedural, to send a bill back to a committee just before a floor vote on passage of the legislation is held. Both parties, when in the minority, have these motions to "make political statements and try to embarrass the majority for partisan advantage," according to David Wolfensberger, an expert on parliamentary rules and former Republican staffer on the House Rules Committee. Our ruling Powell said that Cantor, during the threat of a government shutdown last year, voted to ensure Congress would continue to be paid and against offering the same protection to members of the military. But Powell got it backwards. Cantor, during a period of high political gamesmanship, supported Republican legislation that, in the event of shutdown, would have continued military pay and withheld paychecks for Congress members. He simply opposed two procedural efforts by Democrats that would have given them some bragging rights. Powell’s charge was not off-the-cuff. It came during a portion of a debate when he got to ask Cantor a direct question. Powell, in comments leading up to his query, said he’d given plenty of thought to what he’d ask. That suggests he had time to check all the facts. Powell should take heat for ridiculously distorting Cantor’s votes. So we give his statement our lowest rating -- Pants on Fire.

pomt-14161	"Research even shows that sending more girls to school can boost an entire country’s GDP."	mostly true	/global-news/statements/2016/apr/29/michelle-obama/michelle-obama-research-shows-educating-girls-can-/	Among the causes First Lady Michelle Obama has championed during her time in the White House is improving the lot of girls and women worldwide. About a year ago, Obama helped kick off Let Girls Learn, an interagency effort focused on educating adolescent girls. "Studies from the World Bank show that one extra year of secondary school can increase a girl's future income by 15 to 25 percent," Obama said in an interview with a U.S. Agency for International Development publication. "And we know that when girls are educated, they are less likely to contract HIV, more likely to delay childbearing and vaccinate their children, and have lower maternal and infant mortality rates. Research even shows that sending more girls to school can boost an entire country’s GDP." We’ve seen that claim about educating girls and a rising GDP before. Is it true? Largely, yes. Research does show that a higher percentage of girls in school correlates with a higher gross domestic product. But those findings are much more limited than many people understand. Behind all the research, there’s uncertainty about whether a stronger economy leads to more girls in school, or if more girls in school leads to a stronger economy. No single rule applies everywhere. A stronger economy, for instance, provides both the resources and incentives to educate more women, who go to school, earn more and boost the economy a little higher. But it doesn’t always work that way. In the Middle East and North Africa, more women might be educated but for social and religious reasons, they can’t work, or must work in jobs that don’t fully reward their level of education. And the biggest sticking point is that what’s been called the "girl effect" seems to be much stronger in middle-income countries. For poorer nations, the effect is more muted. A few key studies and cautions The White House press office backed up the First Lady’s claim by citing policy reports that declared that educating girls and young women would boost a country’s economy. One from the World Bank said "By effectively educating more women -- that is, providing more women with a high-quality education -- more will enter the labor market, and the economy will show the favorable results." Those reports didn’t actually give the underlying research, so we’ll cover the highlights. • A 2009 article in the journal Feminist Economics compared regions of the world and measured gender gaps in both education and employment. That’s worth noting because, while the two generally go hand-in-hand, they are separate. You can educate girls, but if companies won’t hire them, a lot of the economic benefit is lost. This study’s bottom line was that between 1960 and 2000, East Asia’s growth rate was .9 percent higher than the region of the Middle East-North Africa. The difference was due to the higher fraction of girls in school in East Asia. • A 2011 World Bank study took 14 countries and teased out what would happen if every girl finished whatever level of school she was in -- either primary or secondary. Not surprisingly, the economic impact depended hugely on a country’s starting point. India and China, for example, had very low rates of girls not completing school, while on the opposite end, places like Burundi and Senegal had dropout rates over 80 percent. So the study found that getting girls and young women to complete a given level of schooling added a "barely noticeable" amount in India and China, while in the other countries, researchers predicted a hefty rise. One important contribution of this research is it factored in the diminishing returns of educating more women. When more people hit the job market, it tends to drive wages down. There’s still a net gain, but in this study, earnings could be about 20 percent less than you might expect. Tuck that point away and keep it in mind for the next landmark analysis on our list. It provided advocacy groups with a talking point that has gone viral. • In a 1999 World Bank paper Gender inequality, income and growth: Are good times good for women?, economists David Dollar and Roberta Gatti worked with data on 100 nations. The finding that gained the most traction was that "in the countries with higher initial education, an increase of 1 percentage point in the share of adult women with secondary school education implies an increase in per capita income growth of 0.3 percentage points." That might seem like a simple equation, but it actually makes two points that are often overlooked. The economic growth took place only in middle-income countries that already had a higher rate of educating women. "For the poorer half of the observations, there is no relationship between female attainment and income," the authors wrote. The other generally ignored element is that the 1 percent increase in educated women applies to completing secondary education. Simply putting more girls in classrooms at any grade level wouldn’t necessarily deliver the same results. You have to get the girls all the way through high school. Specifics are important when measuring education gains Here’s where many organizations, including USAID, get into trouble. They say -- right now on their website -- that "if 10 percent more girls attend school, a country’s GDP increases by an average of 3 percent." That statement has three flaws. First, it treats all nations the same, whether they are low income or middle income. Second, it treats all education the same, whether it’s primary or secondary. Perhaps most troubling is it scales up the original equation by a factor of 10. Dollar, now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told us that doing that "is a bit risky." "You would expect diminishing returns," he said. Which takes us back to that 2011 World Bank study we tucked away. It predicted wages would be about 20 percent lower than you would expect. Less money in women’s pockets means less economic activity, and less economic growth. Our ruling Michelle Obama said that research shows that sending girls to school can boost a country’s entire economy. That’s a fairly broad statement and broadly speaking, it’s accurate. Research from economists at the World Bank and elsewhere suggest that it’s possible that educating more girls produces a stronger economy. But researchers can’t say whether it’s the education of girls that leads to growth, or the growth that leads to more education of women. Plus, women can hit roadblocks in the job market even if they are educated. The research shows that, too. Obama’s statement is accurate but it needs additional information.

pomt-09370	"The average student will be spending $1,700 to $1,800 more during the life of their loan because of this surcharge."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/30/lindsey-graham/new-bill-doesnt-alter-interest-rate/	Oddly enough, student loans have become part of the health care debate. Tucked into the package of health care "fixes" passed by Congress is a provision that would eliminate government subsidies to private lenders and expand federal lending to students. Republicans, including South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, aren't keen on the development. He says the government is effectively taking over the student loan process and that students will actually end up paying more for their loans as a result. "The average student will be spending $1,700 to $1,800 more during the life of their loan because of this surcharge," Graham said on the March 24, 2010, episode of On the Record with Greta Van Susteren. "From the students' point of view, it's going to cost you $1,700 to $1,800 more to pay your student loan off, and all the money goes to the federal government." Graham's statement deserves a little background on how students have been getting loans to pay for their education. At some schools, students go directly to the U.S. Department of Education for their loan. But at others, students go through a private lender to get the same assistance. For nearly 45 years, the government has been paying private lending services to administer loans granted through the Federal Family Education Loan program. But the package of fixes, which President Barack Obama has signed, eliminates those payments and expands direct federal lending to students through the Department of Education. According to the House Education and Labor Committee, the effort will save $61 billion over 10 years, with a good chunk of that savings being used to expand current federal student lending programs, including Pell Grants. Approximately $9 billion will be used to offset some of the health care bill's cost. Graham's reasoning has to do with interest rates. In the same interview, he said that the Education Department borrows money for the loans from the Treasury Department at an interest rate of 2.6 percent. But students will then have to pay 6.4 percent in interest on those loans. In fact, Graham is slightly off here; the government borrows money at a rate of 2.8 percent while students pay interest at a rate of 6.8 percent on unsubsidized government loans. (Subsidized loans have a lower interest rate.) Furthermore, the interest rate the Education Department pays on money it borrows from the Treasury varies, and can be larger in the long run. But regardless, Graham's underlying point is this: As a result of the health care bill, the government will be making more of a profit off the interest students pay on student loans than it did before. We called and e-mailed Graham's office repeatedly for sourcing on his claim, but our inquiries were unanswered. Apparently Graham's numbers come from an amendment offered by Tennessee Republican Lamar Alexander during the Senate's debate over a package of fixes. His amendment would have forced the chamber to send the bill back to committee and amend it to reduce interest rates on student loans by 1.5 percent, from 6.8 percent to 5.3 percent. That interest rate reduction would have saved students in Tennessee upwards of $1,700 to $1,800 in interest over 10 years, according to Alexander. But those numbers were specific to Tennessee, and Alexander was making the point that lowering the interest rate on student loans could save students money in the long run. But beyond those two points, we take issue with the fact that Graham leaves out the important detail that the new bill does not change the interest rate students pay on their loans, according to the education policy experts we spoke with. "This bill does not change interest rates in any way shape or form," said Jason Delisle, director of the Federal Education Budget Project for the Education Policy Program for the New America Foundation. "They are already in law and they're going to stay that way." So to say that students are somehow paying $1,700 or $1,800 more is wrong. Before Congress voted to eliminate subsidies for the Federal Family Education Loan, students paid 6.8 percent on their unsubsidized federal loans. Now that the bill is passed, students will still pay 6.8 percent interest on those loans. There is no "surcharge" in the bill, as Graham says. We rate this claim False.

pomt-07934	Says required state septic inspections would cost septic tank owners $100 to $150 every five years.	half-true	/florida/statements/2011/jan/27/dennis-jones/florida-septic-tank-inspections/	Members of the state Legislature who resoundingly voted in 2010 to require people to have their septic tanks inspected once every five years now say the new law -- sorry for the pun -- stinks. The idea, to help prevent sewage from leaking out of septic tanks and into the state groundwater system, isn't the problem, they say. It's the cost to septic tank owners that worries legislators. They agreed in November to push back the implementation of the bill from Jan. 1, 2011, until July 1, 2011, to delay any fiscal impact on septic tank owners. And now, the entire proposal appears to be -- okay, last pun -- circling the drain. A Senate committee debated reversing many of the requirements on Jan. 26, 2011, less than a year after the initial legislation passed. State Sen. Charlie Dean, R-Inverness, who voted for the inspection requirement but is now leading a fight to have it removed or replaced, said the law has been met with almost "unanimous disapproval," and that many septic tank owners are not in areas where they would affect water quality, anyway. Sen. Nancy Detert, R-Venice, another 'Yes' vote in 2010, said the requirement is unnecessary. If someone's septic tank breaks, they'll have it fixed, she said. "The previous incarnation of this legislation started out to protect the springs," Detert said. "It became a huge overreach and overrun." But Sen. Dennis Jones, R-Treasure Island, said he saw merits in the law (which he voted for, too, by the way). The inspection will help keep sewage from entering the state water system. It will keep homeowners' septic tanks in better shape. And it can serve a public good. On top of all that, Jones said, the cost is marginal. "I don't think it's that expensive to spend $100 to $150 every five years," he said. Does all this talk and concern really boil down to $30 a year? PolitiFact Florida decided to find out. Septic tanks largely unchecked The septic tank inspection requirement seemed to be controversial from the moment it was approved and signed into law on June 4, 2010, by then-Gov. Charlie Crist. According to the Department of Health, there are more than 2.6 million septic sewage systems in Florida serving about a third of the state's population. But less than 1 percent of the state's systems -- about 17,000 -- are being inspected and serviced by licensed maintenance professionals. In most cases, septic systems are only checked or serviced when they fail. And more than half of the state's septic systems are at least 30 years old. Leaky septic tanks have been identified by health and environmental officials as major sources of water pollution. So a group of legislators worked for several years to try to force inspections. The law that finally passed in 2010 attempted to mute concerns over cost. It requires inspections every five years (the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency suggests an inspection every three to five years), creates a grant program for low-income homeowners and allows certain homeowners to request a one-time, one-year inspection extension. "Pay a little bit now or all of us will pay a whole lot later," said former state Sen. Lee Constantine, R-Altamonte Springs, who was behind the 2010 law. But concerns over the cost to homeowners quickly escalated. The Legislature passed a measure to stall implementation of the law during a November special session, and then waited until Gov. Rick Scott took office to send the bill to the governor's office to prevent a possible veto from Crist. Scott allowed the delay to become law without his signature. "I applaud Governor Scott for allowing Senate Bill 2A to become law," Senate Majority Leader Andy Gardiner, R-Orlando, who voted for the original 2010 law, said in a statement. "This decisive step postpones the implementation of septic tank inspection regulations, enabling lawmakers to analyze whether or not such a mandate is necessary and saving taxpayer dollars in the meantime." Interestingly, a state Senate analysis found that the inspection requirement would create hundreds "if not thousands" of private sector jobs because of a shortage of certified septic tank inspectors. The Department of Health estimated that annual septic tank inspections would grow from 17,000 a year to 500,000. The cost of an inspection All this leads to the main point of this fact check -- just how much would an inspection cost? Jones said the cost of the inspection is between $100 and $150, to be paid once every five years. But we found references to the inspection costing $500. And then other references to $200. In an interview with PolitiFact Florida, Jones said he used information from the Department of Health for his estimate. But he believed the number might even be high. He said he spoke with people who believe that an influx of new private inspectors will naturally drive down costs because of increased competition. Michelle Dahnke, a health department spokeswoman, said private contractors would do the inspections. The department estimated an inspection would cost $150, she said, but that contractors ultimately would set the price and compete for business. We then asked two private-sector experts to talk about the cost of an inspection. Ellen Vause, president of Florida Septic Inc. in Hawthorne, said the cost of the inspection will depend on what the state actually requires and where the septic tank is located. Vause said that a standard inspection, which would include pumping out sewage from a septic tank system, costs $150 to $300 now in North Florida, and $200 to $350 in South Florida. The main difference, Vause said, is the cost to dispose of the sludge. But Vause said she would expect costs to drop if more inspections were required because contractors could do several inspections in the same neighborhood on the same day, saving on transportation and disposal costs. Bob Himschoot, a member of the Florida Onsite Wastewater Association and an owner of a septic tank contracting company in Fort Myers, pegged the cost slightly higher -- between $325 and $500. The cost includes the labor cost of a technician, who must be qualified to drive a commercial vacuum truck, equipment cost and the cost to dispose of the waste. The cost of the inspection is only one part of the problem, though. The worry is that the inspector finds something wrong. It's like going to the car mechanic for an oil change. You find out your brakes need fixing. Your wheels are out of alignment. Your tires are wearing thin. (And dollar signs dance through your head.) That's exactly the point of the 2010 law, of course, to identify problems to keep contaminants from seeping into the ground. The Department of Health, in draft rules, would require septic tank owners to repair tanks that are cracked and replace systems where sewage is flowing directly into the ground. Should your system need to replaced entirely -- systems generally last between 20 and 30 years -- that will cost $5,000 to $7,500 on average. "It's just another thing for the government to get mixed up with when they have no business sticking their nose in there," said Ralph Pohl, 77, who installed a septic tank 18 years ago at his home in Seacrest in the Panhandle and hasn't had it inspected once. Pohl reports no problems with his system. "I have no problem with someone coming and taking a look if there's any seepage or things like that," he said. "To force an inspector to come out and dig out a perfectly operating septic tank -- I don't see the point. If they're working, there's no problem. If they're not working, the homeowner is going to have to do something." There's another obvious, but critical point to consider when talking about the cost of a septic tank inspection. People using septic tanks don't pay for a central sewer system. People without septic tanks do. We did some math for three areas -- St. Petersburg in Pinellas County, Lakeland in Polk County, and the residents of Marion County -- and found that the typical sewer system customer will pay $375-$400 a year for sewer service in those three areas. Septic tank users would pay nothing. Over five years, that's $1,875-$2,000 in sewer charges versus nothing. "It's really a very inexpensive method compared to a central sewer system," Himschoot said. Our ruling In talking about making changes to a law requiring septic tank inspections once every five years, Sens. Dean and Detert didn't question the need to have properly functioning septic tanks but argued that the inspection itself was unnecessary for many people. Jones countered that the cost of the inspection alone isn't that great, especially when spread out over five years. Jones said an inspection would cost $100 to $150, citing a Department of Health estimate. Spread over five years, that's an investment of as little as $30 a year -- much less than homeowners with a central sewer system pay. But that's not telling the entire story. Experts we talked to said the price of an inspection could cost up to $500 and depends on a number of variables. On top of that, the inspection could result in finding problems that could require repairs at additional cost. That's obviously part of the intent of the bill, but it comes at a cost nevertheless. We think that's enough of difference to rate this claim Half True.	None	Dennis Jones	None	None	None	2011-01-27T17:13:52	2011-01-26	['None']
pomt-05469	Ron Oakley's "conservative leadership protected local taxpayers over government bureaucrats" as the Water Management District’s budget decreased by "58 percent in the four years he served on the board."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/apr/22/ron-oakley/ron-oakley-conservative-leadership-water-managemen/	Ron Oakley acknowledges that in election years, a lot of candidates talk like conservatives. But if you believe a recent mailer from his campaign, he is a proven conservative with a record of reining in government. Need proof? Oakley, a Republican candidate for Pasco County commission, offers his time on the governing board of the Southwest Florida Water Management District. His mailer makes a pair of specific claims about his experience with the agency’s budget. It helps to quote at length: "Ron Oakley was a consistent voice and vote for lower taxes. Applying the principles he learned while leading his family businesses, Oakley voted to cut the District’s millage rate by 43 percent — from .687 to .392 mils." The mailer continues: "Ron Oakley voted to reduce the Water Management District’s budget by 58 percent in the four years he served on the board. His conservative leadership protected local taxpayers over government bureaucrats." There’s no doubt the agency’s spending has plummeted. Here, we are checking whether Oakley’s leadership resulted in those cuts. Can he take credit for cuts ordered by state officials? Oakley, an east Pasco citrus grower, joined the 13-member water district board in June 2007. The first budget he voted on was for Fiscal Year 2008. As a baseline for his claims, he used the previous budget, FY 2007, that was in place when he took office. Informally known as Swiftmud, the agency covers portions of 16 counties and at the time had eight water basins with different tax rates. For example, folks in Trinity or Pinellas County paid a total tax rate of 0.822 that year, or 82 cents in taxes for every $1,000 of assessed value. The tax rate for owners in Bradenton or Sarasota was only 0.582. Oakley, 66, used his hometown Withlacoochee River basin, covering northeast Pasco and parts of five other counties to the north. (That’s also the district for his opponent, incumbent Commissioner Ted Schrader.) That basin’s total tax rate was 0.687 that year, about average for the eight basins. The first budget Oakley voted on included a 0.617 tax rate for property owners in the Withlacoochee basin. That reduction was ordered by property tax legislation signed by Gov. Charlie Crist in June 2007. The rate was left unchanged for the next two years. In fall 2010, the board adopted a rate of 0.608. Then the world changed. Gov. Rick Scott was elected November 2010. His initial budget proposal — released in February 2011 — called for a 25 percent cut to Swiftmud’s property taxes. Then lawmakers sharpened their knives and ordered a 36 percent cut for Swiftmud, the largest cut of Florida’s five water districts. Scott signed the legislation requiring that cut. To shrink the budget that much, board members eliminated the basin districts, and their tax rates — more on that later. They later set a property tax rate of 0.392. Bottom-line budget figures tell a similar story. When Oakley took office, Swiftmud’s budget was $383 million. Oakley and other board members adopted a slightly larger budget the next year, $395 million. Even with a tax rate cut, the budget grew from higher property values and increased state money. The next three budgets were: $376.5 million (FY 2009); $298.9 million (FY 2010); and $279.8 (FY 2011). Thank plunging property values and reduced state spending for those cuts. Then Scott took office, ordered more cuts, and the budget plummeted to $155 million. That figure is 59.4 percent smaller than Oakley’s baseline budget. Darn close to his 58 percent claim. Oakley’s last meeting was May 24, 2011. He said he should get credit for that year’s budget cuts because he cast votes on preliminary versions of the budget. As with many local governments, key budget decisions are made early in the year. Details get ironed out closer to final passage in the fall. The governing board eliminated the basins during that May meeting. The majority of the budget cut came from wiping out the basins, though there was $41 million in unspent basin money included in the spending plan. The district also lost nearly all of its state funding. Several board members lamented the move, saying the basins were a vital conduit to local citizens on water issues. But it was clear a larger power was at play. "I guess it’s sort of like an edict from Tallahassee," said board member Todd Pressman, the lone dissenting vote on the plan. Added board member Jeff Adams: "It’s not something that was suggested. It’s been mandated, and it’s been forced to us." Oakley said board members had options. They could have removed all the basins. They could have consolidated them into three larger districts. They could have sliced more money from the overall agency budget. "We chose the option we thought was best," he said. However they found the money, board members still had to meet the 36 percent reduction. "We’ve already committed to the tax reductions," Deputy Executive Director Kurt Fritsch said during a budget workshop later in the meeting. "We have met the governor’s promises. The governor promised a tax reduction. He’s getting it." During an interview last week, Oakley said the board was considering cuts before the governor and lawmakers made their proposals. That’s true. The board in January approved a staff report calling for a drop in the district’s base tax rate. The report also suggested looking for "further opportunities" to reduce the basin tax rates. "The Legislature was sending us a message they wanted us to cut more," he said. "I don’t know many people that want to fight the Legislature." Oakley’s claims of eye-popping cuts to Swiftmud’s tax rate and budget are largely correct. And we’ll give him partial credit for "voting on" the budget in 2011, even though he only voted on a preliminary version and not the final product. But the bottom line is most of those eye-popping cuts came as Oakley was leaving office, and they were specifically ordered by Scott and the Legislature. For most of Oakley’s four years at Swiftmud, the agency saw much more modest budget reductions, thanks largely to declining state money and falling property values. Oakley’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. In this case, Tallahassee politicians should get the lion’s share of the credit for the 2011 cuts. We rate Oakley’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-11681	"Trump vows to end winter heating assistance for elderly and disabled."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2018/jan/03/democrats-rising/headline-misleads-about-trumps-budget-proposal-and/	President Donald Trump proposed eliminating a program to help millions of Americans heat or cool their homes, according to a viral story by a liberal website. "Trump vows to end winter heating assistance for elderly and disabled," stated the Nov. 26 headline by Democrats Rising, an anti-Trump website. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found that this story failed to tell the entire story: while Trump proposed getting rid of a heating assistance program several months ago, the federal government has continued to fund it. The Democrats Rising article, written as winter weather was setting in, misleads by stating that millions of households will be at risk of losing heat this winter. But that’s not what the facts show. Democrats Rising didn’t name the program, but it appears to be a reference to the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), a program started in 1981. The program provides federal dollars to help poor people pay their home energy bill, energy crises, weatherization and energy-related minor home repairs. On average, the annual heating/winter crisis assistance benefit per household was $371 in fiscal year 2015. In March, Trump’s budget blueprint called for cutting money for several programs that help low-income Americans including LIHEAP. The document said that LIHEAP "is a lower-impact program and is unable to demonstrate strong performance outcomes." The budget request for the Administration for Children and Families stated that utility companies and state and local governments provide significant heating and cooling assistance and that the majority of states prohibit utilities from discontinuing heat during the winter. Trump’s proposal faced pushback from senators, including many in cold weather states. A bipartisan group of a few dozen senators wrote a letter in September urging the federal government to release funds for LIHEAP as quickly as possible under the continuing resolution. U.S. Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Jack Reed, D-R.I., led the bipartisan group to push for $3.39 billion, the same amount allocated in the previous fiscal year. On Sept. 8, Trump signed the continuing resolution to continue funding appropriations for a few months. That allowed the Department of Health and Human Services in October to release $3.03 billion for states, tribes and territories for the heating program for fiscal year 2018. That represents 90 percent of the funding available under the continuing appropriations act. We asked a spokeswoman for Health and Human Services when the remaining 10 percent will be provided. Trump’s proposed budget did not include funding for LIHEAP, Monique Richards said. Funding will be determined by the passage of appropriations legislation from Congress. In the past, the federal government has released 90 percent of the funding under a "seasonability exception," said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors’ Association. "Because LIHEAP spends so early in the fiscal year, if funding was delayed it would cause a hardship to low-income families," he said. A spokesman for Trump did not respond to our questions. Our ruling Democrats Rising said that "Trump vows to end winter heating assistance for elderly and disabled." There is a kernel of truth in that headline, because Trump’s budget blueprint in March proposed eliminating LIHEAP. But Democrats Rising omits the final outcome: amid pushback from a bipartisan group of senators, the heating assistance program continued. In October, the federal government released $3 billion for the program. We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-01288	As a result of Obamacare, "California seniors face benefit cuts of over $1,700."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/31/american-crossroads/rove-pac-says-obamacare-cuts-1700-medicare-benefit/	Even though Rep. Ami Bera, D-Calif., wasn’t in office when Obamacare passed, a pro-Republican ad in California’s seventh congressional district is using the law to attack him. Bera is running against Republican Doug Ose for a second term, and it’s a tight race. Less than six months into his first term, Bera voted against repealing the Affordable Care Act, and American Crossroads, Karl Rove’s conservative political action committee, used this fact to appeal to California seniors in a recent ad. "Bera voted to keep Obamacare, which cut $716 billion from Medicare, slashing Medicare Advantage," the ad’s narrator says. "Now California seniors face benefit cuts of over $1,700." Many times, we’ve rated the claim that there are $716 billion in Medicare cuts as Half True. But we hadn’t heard claims about specific benefit cuts by state before, so we decided to check it out. We found that the claim that California seniors will see $1,700 in benefit cuts as a result of the Affordable Care Act is misleading. The statistic comes from a report that ignores critical context and evidence that the law has expanded Medicare’s benefits packages. Advantages We should first note that the statistic comes from an April 2014 report by the American Action Forum, and they have a stake in the election. The American Action Forum is an arm of the American Action Network, which is a conservative political nonprofit with financial ties to the Koch brothers. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the group shares office space with American Crossroads -- the group that produced the very ad we’re checking. Now to the claim. The ad makes it sound like all California seniors will face cuts to this degree. However, the report only addresses Medicare Advantage. About one-third of seniors use Medicare Advantage, which is a private coverage option. Medicare Advantage plans are required to provide at minimum the same array of benefits as traditional Medicare. Many Advantage plans offer extra benefits -- things like gym memberships, vision exams or generous cost-sharing -- that have contributed to escalating program costs. The creators of Medicare Advantage thought that letting seniors choose plans from private insurance providers would be more cost-effective than traditional Medicare. But Advantage has turned out to be more expensive. Medicare paid insurers about 114 percent more for Advantage plans than for traditional plans, as of 2009 before enactment of the federal health care law. The law attempted to close that gap in part by gradually reducing how much Medicare pays Advantage plan providers. It was estimated that its changes would slow down spending on Medicare by about $716 billion over 10 years, and Medicare Advantage cost-saving measures accounted for about one-third of that. (Though the Obama administration has reversed these cuts for the past two years -- facing pressure from insurance providers, Republicans and some Democrats, including Bera.) Critics argue that the cuts will force insurance providers to reduce the benefits they offer to Medicare Advantage enrollees. However, Medicare Advantage plans are still required to offer, at minimum, the same level of benefits as traditional plans. And Obamacare includes language protecting that set of guaranteed benefits from shrinking. In fact, the law expanded Medicare’s required benefits to include certain preventative services, annual visits, closing a gap in prescription coverage and more. Additionally, the law rewards Medicare Advantage providers with financial bonuses to encourage quality and cost-efficiency. Providers are required to use the bonuses to offer extra benefits, attracting more enrollees. Nearly all Medicare Advantage plan providers received these bonuses in 2012, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. A matter of speculation It’s possible that Medicare Advantage providers could respond to their pay cut by reducing benefits, but the only benefits they could cut would be those extra benefits that go beyond Medicare plan requirements. "It's not automatic and won't affect every (Advantage) enrollee or any of the (traditional Medicare) enrollees," said Dylan Roby, an expert in health economics at the University of California Los Angeles Center for Health Policy Research. Insurance providers could also respond to lower payments by offering the same benefits while operating more efficiently. They could cut administrative costs, adjust cost-sharing plans, take in less profit or drop out of the market altogether. But, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the Department of Health and Human Services and more, insurance providers’ response to the cuts has been less dramatic than was expected when Obama signed the legislation in 2010. In fact, Medicare Advantage enrollment is at an all-time high, and the percentage of plans with four or more stars in the program’s five-star rating system is increasing. "When Congress debated the payment reductions in 2010, forecasters and analysts also projected that reductions would drive insurers to raise premiums, cut extra benefits and even pull out of the Medicare Advantage market," Kaiser experts wrote in May. "Thus far, however, the response by insurers to the (Affordable Care Act) cuts has been more muted." Health and Human Services reported in fall 2013 that "The average number of plan choices will remain about the same in 2014 and access to supplemental benefits remains stable. Since passage of the Affordable Care Act, average MA premiums are down by 9.8 percent." Experts also told us that they haven’t seen evidence of reduced Medicare Advantage cuts. "The evidence is that plan participation has been stable, premiums have been stable or even a little bit lower, and there are no overall changes in the benefits provided," said Jack Hoadley, a research professor at Georgetown University and a member of the nonpartisan Medicare Payment Advisory Commission. "In my view, the claims in this advertisement are misleading," Hoadley added. "Seniors have not faced benefit cuts in Medicare Advantage, even though the plans (and providers) have to manage with somewhat lower payments." So how did the American Action forum report come up with their estimated benefit cut figures? The American Action Forum report breaks down the reduction in Medicare payments to Advantage plan providers by state and county. It says, compared to pre-Obamacare, Medicare Advantage benefits in California are down $1,718 per beneficiary. We asked several experts to take a look at the report, and they told us that it is misleading because it assumes that Obamacare’s spending reductions directly results in reduced benefits. Yes, Obamacare reduces Medicare’s spending per Advantage beneficiary, but this does not necessarily mean fewer benefits for seniors with Advantage plans. Like we said before, there are multiple ways that an insurance provider can deal with the spending cuts other than slimming down its offerings. "To immediately treat it as a cut to benefits is an exaggeration," said Judith Feder, a professor of health policy at Georgetown University. Our ruling American Crossroads said that as a result of Obamacare, "California seniors face benefit cuts of over $1,700." First of all, this claim is misleading because it makes it seem like all seniors will face these cuts, when the statistic actually refers to Medicare Advantage enrollees -- only about one-third of seniors. The statistic comes from a report that assumes all reductions in Medicare Advantage spending results in fewer benefits for enrollees. While insurance providers feel the cuts, there are multiple ways for them to respond other than reducing benefits, such as trimming administrative costs. We heard from multiple experts and researchers who said Medicare Advantage benefits have remained stable. The ad also leaves out the fact that the federal health care law expanded Medicare’s minimum required benefits and established incentives for Advantage plans to provide extra benefits. It’s possible that some Medicare Advantage enrollees could see their benefits shrink, but this ad blows that possibility out of proportion and ignores important context. We rate this claim False.

pomt-02880	"They delayed my swearing-in here in Massachusetts for a couple weeks so they could ram (the health care law) through."	false	/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/12/scott-brown/scott-brown-says-opponents-delayed-his-swearing-pa/	Former Massachusetts Republican U.S. Sen. Scott Brown took a stroll down memory lane Monday while talking about the health care law with Fox News’ Gretchen Carlson. Brown, who is now a Fox News contributor, claimed the architects of Obamacare delayed Brown’s swearing-in in 2010 to help "ram" the law through Congress. "They rammed it through before I got there, knowing I would be there in a week or two," Brown said on The Real Story with Gretchen Carlson. "They delayed my swearing-in here in Massachusetts for a couple weeks so they could ram it through and did not pass one amendment to make it better for the American people, and they should be held accountable." As Brown finished his point about his swearing-in, people watching could hear Carlson say, "I remember." But did she remember right? Brown was elected in a 2010 special election to finish the term of the late-Sen. Edward Kennedy. When Kennedy died on Aug. 25, 2009, Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick appointed a Democrat, Paul Kirk, to hold his seat. State law requires a special election for federal seats to be held between 145 and 160 days of when the vacancy occurred -- or in the case of Kennedy’s seat somewhere between Jan. 17, 2010, and Feb. 1, 2010. Massachusetts’ election was Jan. 19, 2010, the first Tuesday in that window. Brown, who had campaigned on being the 41st vote against the health care legislation, defeated Democrat Martha Coakley by a vote of 52 percent to 47 percent. Brown’s victory did not mean he could just move to Capitol Hill and start casting votes the next day. Brown was sworn in Feb. 4, 2010, 16 days after his election. Was his swearing-in ceremony delayed? No. Cities and towns in Massachusetts have 15 days to send final results to the Massachusetts Secretary of State, including a 10-day window for counting absentee and overseas ballots. "It wasn’t delayed," said Brian McNiff, a spokesman for Secretary of State William Galvin. "This process had to be done." In fact, Brown was sworn in a week earlier than he had planned, according to media reports. After receiving criticism of his "three-week victory lap" from a newspaper columnist, he wrote state officials asking for his election results to be certified immediately. The results were certified by the governor’s council and sent to the U.S. Senate "as soon as the ink was dry," McNiff said. Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill So if anything, Brown’s swearing-in actually came a week earlier than originally planned. But what about the Democrats in Washington? Did they scramble to pass health care reform before Brown took his seat? Again, no. Weeks before Brown’s election, the Senate had already passed its version of health care reform, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, on Dec. 24, 2009, on a 60-39 vote. (Kirk voted yes.) But the legislation needed to pass the House, and House Democratic leaders wanted to make changes that echoed their priorities. Problem was, any big changes to the Senate bill would send it back to the upper chamber for final approval, where the 39 Republicans and the newly elected Brown could now filibuster the bill. Top Democrats wondered what to do. One option widely reported before Brown’s election was to pass the health care law before Brown took his seat. But on Jan. 20, 2010, the day after Brown’s election, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nv., took that plan off the table. "We’re going to wait until the new senator arrives until we do anything more on health care," Reid said. In the end, the House passed the Senate bill on March 21, 2010. On that same day, the House passed a slew of their own measures in a separate bill, which the Senate passed March 25, 2010, through a filibuster-proof process known as reconciliation. One last point: Brown’s 16-day wait from election to swearing-in is in line with other recent Senate special elections. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker was elected after the death of Sen. Frank Lautenberg on Oct. 16, 2013, and sworn in 15 days later on Oct. 31, 2013. And Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey won the special election to replace John Kerry on June 25, 2013, and did not take the oath of office until July 16, 2013 -- 21 days later. Our ruling Brown said, "They delayed my swearing-in here in Massachusetts for a couple weeks so they could ram (the health care law) through." We never heard back from Brown, but the record is pretty clear on this. His swearing-in wasn’t delayed, and the Senate did not "ram" the health care law through in the time between his election and his taking the oath of office. We rate his claim False.

pomt-09753	Health care premiums for consumers have doubled since 2001.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/07/jay-rockefeller/rockefeller-says-health-insurance-premiums-have-do/	Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., recently wrote an opinion piece for the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call in which he said, "Insurance companies have seen their profits soar by more than 400 percent since 2001, while premiums for consumers have doubled." We address the first part of this statement in another item ; we'll take up the second half here. The 2009 Employer Health Benefits Survey, published by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research and Educational Trust, is considered the definitive source for health benefits cost information, and its data stretch from 1999 to 2009. (Even though Rockefeller didn't explicitly say it, we'll assume he was talking about the period since 2001 when he made this assertion.) In 2001, average annual premiums for single people were $2,689, a number that rose to $4,824 by 2008 — a 79 percent increase. The amounts for family coverage rose over the same period from $7,061 to $13,375 — an 89 percent increase. So, in neither case did the cost of benefits actually double, although they are in the ballpark. However, if you read Rockefeller's language closely, he did say, "premiums for consumers have doubled" — and if you use the data for the employee-paid portion of health benefits by itself, he's right. For individuals, the employee cost rose from $355 to $779 and for families it rose from $1,787 to $3,515. The former jump is easily double, while the latter is just shy of double. Using this calculation, Rockefeller is right. We rate his assertion True.	None	Jay Rockefeller	None	None	None	2009-10-07T16:47:53	2009-09-21	['None']
pomt-14394	Says President Barack Obama has "been presiding over our jobs going overseas for seven years."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/16/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-pins-too-much-blame-outflow-jobs-barack-o/	One of the biggest topics in the 2016 presidential election has been how to reverse the loss of American jobs to other countries. On NBC’s Meet the Press, Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz blamed President Barack Obama for the outflow of jobs. The topic came up after host Chuck Todd played a clip of Obama saying the Republicans are significantly to blame for the angry tone of politics today. Cruz responded, "You know, Chuck, Barack Obama's a world-class demagogue. That language there is designed to divide us. No, Mr. President, we're not angry at that. We're angry at politicians in Washington, including you, who ignore the men and women who elected you, who have been presiding over our jobs going overseas for seven years." The part of Cruz’s comment that caught our eye was that Obama has "been presiding over our jobs going overseas for seven years." We decided to take a look. (Cruz’s staff did not respond to inquiries.) We found that Cruz has a point that the United States has seen jobs go overseas during the seven years that Obama has been in office. However, this pattern was well under way before Obama became president -- and the trend has little to do with policy choices a president can make. We will start by noting that there are two related but distinct reasons why jobs may move overseas. One is when foreign companies become competitive enough to sell their products in the United States, displacing American producers. The other occurs when American companies move their own production to subcontractors overseas. We will also note that there is no single data source that provides specific numbers of jobs flowing overseas. We did find a couple of studies that touched on this subject; however, each has drawbacks. One source of data is the National Organizations Survey, a pilot study of U.S. businesses and nonprofits described in a paper by Clair Brown of the University of California-Berkeley, Timothy Sturgeon of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Connor Cole of the University of Michigan. The survey was conducted in 2010, meaning that it captured a snapshot in time, rather than a study of changes over time. The survey found that about 23 percent of full-time employees worked at organizations that do international outsourcing, meaning that they either had such duties as sales, research, transportation and customer service handled by a part of the company based in another country, or by contracting with an overseas company to handle those tasks. According to the study, about a third of full-time employees with large organizations worked for one doing international outsourcing; for smaller organizations, the rate was smaller, less than 10 percent. Sectors where international offshoring has been especially noticeable include electronics and motor vehicles. That said, "for the typical U.S. employee’s organization, the majority of costs continue to be in the United States," the authors concluded. The other study does show changes over time, though it’s worth noting that it was published by the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning group that has taken a hard line against the flow of American jobs overseas. The Economic Policy Institute study found that between 2001 and 2013, a growing U.S. trade deficit with China "eliminated or displaced 3.2 million U.S. jobs," of which 2.4 million were in manufacturing. "These lost manufacturing jobs account for about two-thirds of all U.S. manufacturing jobs lost or displaced between December 2001 and December 2013," the paper concluded. Here’s a summary of their findings: Experts we contacted agreed that a significant shift has been going on. "The U.S. economy and many others have been going through wrenching changes for many decades, due to a combination of technological change, globalization, and loss of union power," said Sturgeon, a senior researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Industrial Performance Center. Sturgeon pointed to research by Margaret McMillan at Tufts University that looked at data between 1990 and 2005 and found that a key reason for these trends is "rapid increases in trade" between the United States and China. In a paper, McMillan and three co-authors found that Chinese employment growth has been largest in U.S. industries that have experienced employment declines, suggesting that Chinese workers are being substituted for U.S. workers. She also found that the share of workers performing "routine occupations" in the United States declined as the share increased in China, with these shifts correlated across industries." But while Cruz has a point that jobs have indeed been shifting overseas under Obama, the previous chart shows a distinct problem with Cruz’s contention: The way Cruz phrased it, it sounds like it started under Obama, and that simply isn’t the case. "Most of the advanced economies of the world have long moved into a new, postindustrial phase of development," wrote Dani Rodrik of Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government in a November 2015 paper. "These economies have been deindustrializing for decades, a trend that is particularly noticeable when one looks at the employment share of manufacturing. … In the United States, manufacturing industries’ share of total employment has steadily fallen since the 1950s, coming down from around a quarter of the workforce to less than a tenth today." (We looked at this question previously here.) Indeed, in February 2003, the cover of a special issue of BusinessWeek magazine asked, "Is Your Job Next? A new round of globalization is sending upscale jobs offshore. They include chip design, engineering, basic research -- even financial analysis. Can America lose these jobs and still prosper?" That was about six years before Obama took office. In fact, when PolitiFact asked McMillan whether this pattern predates Obama, she emailed back, "Hell yes," followed by 12 exclamation points. In her paper, McMillan wrote that employment declined modestly in the 1990s in such labor-intensive industries as textiles and became "precipitous" with the advent of the Internet in the late 1990s. She finds that both technological advancements and a growing role for an overseas labor force played a role. The ability to conduct work overseas "has led to fundamental reorganization of the global supply chain, with detrimental effects on domestic manufacturing workers and surging corporate profits," she wrote. The decline in U.S. manufacturing employment between 1987 and 2015 -- starting 22 years before Obama took office -- can be seen in the following graph: So jobs have clearly been moving overseas for many years, even if the trend predated Obama and occurred for reasons other than his policies. Still, it’s worth making a few additional observations: • Manufacturing jobs have been increasing under Obama. While the rise in manufacturing jobs under Obama hasn’t come close to wiping out the declines of previous decades, the number has risen rather than fallen since 2010 -- the first sustained increase since at least the 1990s. There is at least anecdotal evidence of "onshoring" -- the return of jobs to the United States. For instance, 177 "foreign-trade zones" -- special manufacturing and assembly facilities located in the United States -- serve more than 3,000 companies, employ 390,000 workers and handled $835 billion in merchandise, almost two-thirds of it domestically sourced, according to the National Association of Foreign-Trade Zones. • Along with job losses, there have been job gains. Overall, productivity has been improving in the United States. "Specific industries and job categories have been hard hit, sometimes very much so," Sturgeon said. At the same time, many are benefiting, including "in ways they may not even notice, such as new types of work and jobs, greater product variety and lower prices." Sturgeon is among those who argue that Cruz’s answer is too simplistic. "The debate right now is playing to people’s fears and discontent in ways that are nearly devoid of fact or serious consideration of the trade-offs or remedies," he said. Where it comes to Obama’s role, he said, "this is a broad structural issue and not something Obama invented or could do much to change, or even do much to mitigate with an uncooperative Congress." Our ruling Cruz said that Obama has "been presiding over our jobs going overseas for seven years." While the pattern has been occurring under Obama, it is hardly new or unique to Obama.

pomt-07788	"Our children do not spend any time in school learning about our own U.S. Constitution."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2011/feb/21/dan-flynn/state-rep-dan-flynn-says-texas-students-spend-no-t/	In a recent column criticizing the Mansfield school district’s plans to introduce an Arabic program to its schools, state Rep. Dan Flynn, R-Canton, wondered why Arabic culture is a priority "at a time when our children do not spend any time in school learning our own U.S. Constitution." We wondered whether Texas students spend no time studying the Constitution, as Flynn says in the opinion piece published Feb. 14 on the North Texas Navigator news website. When we contacted the representative’s office, Flynn’s chief of staff, David Erinakes told us "there is no dedicated class on the U.S. Constitution as early as first grade, and (Flynn’s) implication is that he believes all Texas school children should have a class on the U.S. Constitution while they’re in school at least one time." Erinakes said that while the Constitution is written into the state’s curriculum standards for the public schools, "there isn’t very much time spent on it." Erinakes said Flynn based this conclusion on conversations with teachers who have recently visited the representative’s office. We turned next to the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills for social studies, curriculum standards outlining what students must be taught in Texas classrooms. In an online post of the standards now in place — an update takes effect in 2011-12 — we spotted about 35 references to teaching students about the constitution. According to the standards, students are introduced to the U.S. Constitution in fifth grade when they must identify "the important ideas in the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution" and "examine fundamental rights guaranteed in the Bill of Rights." Seventh graders should be able to "explain the influence of the U.S. Constitution on the Texas Constitution." Eighth graders are supposed to study "the creation and ratification of the U.S. Constitution." History and government comes under the heading of social studies until high school, when specific courses in those subjects are offered. In a course in U.S. history since the Reconstruction, students are expected to "identify and analyze methods on expanding the right to participate in the Democratic process, including... amendments to the U.S. Constitution." A "significant focus" of the state’s mandatory high school U.S. government class is on "the U.S. Constitution, its underlying principles and ideas and the form of government it created." Next we looked at online versions of the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills tests annually administered to students from grades 3 to 11. Fifth- and eighth-graders must pass the reading and math tests, and 11th-grade students must pass all portions of test, which include social studies, to graduate. Searching for "constitution" in the social-studies portion of the 2009 test for eighth-graders, we found four references, including one question asking students to identify how the 13th Amendment changed the Constitution (B. Abolished slavery). We found five references to the Constitution in the tenth-grade test, including a question about what principle the Constitution’s establishment of the executive, legislative and judicial branches reflects. And in 11th grade? Two references to the U.S. Constitution. Debbie Ratcliffe, an education agency spokeswoman, told us that local educators determine how much time is spent on the Constitution, but she pointed out that each grade is required to observe Celebrate Freedom Week, which falls on the week of Constitution Day — Sept. 17. The standards going into effect in 2011-12 reflect the observance. According to the pending standards, third through eighth grade classes, for example, must include "appropriate instruction concerning the intent, meaning and importance of the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution" during Celebrate Freedom Week, or during another full school week as determined by each school district’s board of trustees. Andy Welch, a spokesman for the Austin school district, told us that Austin teachers teach what the state standards require. Richie Escovedo, a Mansfield district spokesman, told us: "We definitely do teach the Constitution." He pointed us to the district’s curriculum specifying that students study the Constitution in fifth, seventh and 12th grade. Also, Escovedo noted, district third-graders study questions such as, "Why was a new Constitution needed after the American Revolution?" and "How does the Bill of Rights protect you, even as a child?" When we told Flynn that we couldn’t find evidence to support his claim, Erinakes responded: "You are correct that it is in the standards, but as to the time spent it seems to be minimal at best... Relative to the amount of time spent on other subjects, ‘our children do not spend any time at all learning about the U.S. Constitution.’" Flynn’s statement, though, was absolute.

pomt-11833	"CPS students are learning and growing faster than 96 percent of students in the United States."	mostly true	/illinois/statements/2017/nov/10/chicago-public-schools/cps-students-are-learning-and-growing-faster-96-pe/	A Nov. 2 press release from Chicago Public Schools touted significant test score gains made in the district over recent years that were included in a high-profile analysis. Students in CPS, according to research from an expert on education equality at Stanford University, improved at a faster rate on standardized test scores between third and eighth grade than their counterparts in most other U.S. school districts. The findings were clearly a plus for the often-maligned CPS, and the district wasted little time advertising them in a press release headlined, "CPS students are learning and growing faster than 96 percent of students in the United States." The glow of that phrasing suggests that CPS has not just turned a corner when it comes to educational achievement but is dancing circles around most other school districts in the nation. Reconciling that with the district’s problem-plagued reputation merits a closer look. Measuring up CPS’ fast-paced gains were assessed in a report prepared recently by Sean Reardon, a professor of education inequality at Stanford’s Center for Education Policy Analysis. By comparing Chicago Public Schools students’ scores on standardized tests to those of students nationally, Reardon found that the scores of CPS students in grades three through eight improved more from 2009-14 than did the average scores of all U.S. students during that time. Reardon used scores from a standardized test all Illinois students are required to take to measure that growth. But because other states rely on different tests to gauge the same thing, he averaged actual scores in math and English across the nation to benchmark proficiency. "We define grade level as the average of that grade in the country," Reardon said in a phone interview. "The proficiency levels that states set for their tests are defined by groups of experts that say, 'This is what we think a kid should know in this grade.’ " By Reardon’s metric, CPS third-graders taking the test in 2014 performed significantly better than did third-graders who sat for it in 2009. The same held true for the other grades covered by the analysis as well. This improvement factored out to about two-thirds of a grade level over the five-year period for CPS, compared to an average increase for the rest of the nation of just one-sixth of a grade level in performance within that timeframe. So far, so good. But Reardon’s report posed another key question: Improvement aside, how does CPS’ overall academic performance stack up against the rest of the country? Here, the picture was not as rosy. Third- through eighth-graders in the nation’s third-largest district still perform at roughly one half to one-and-a-half grade levels below the national average, which the report describes as a "significant concern." In short, CPS test scores started low, improved significantly, but remain subpar. There’s no reference to that gut check in the CPS press release highlighting Reardon’s work, though the release does provide a link to the full report for those so inclined to read it. Indeed, results from the state’s most recent round of standardized tests point to significant problems at CPS, where only 22 to 30 percent of third- through eighth-graders reached proficiency in core subjects, according to data from the Illinois State Board of Education. A CPS spokesman declined to address questions about the district’s characterization of Reardon’s report. Our ruling Chicago Public Schools stated that "CPS students are learning and growing faster than 96 percent of students in the United States." The claim appears to accurately represent the main conclusion of the Stanford University report from which it was drawn. At the same time, the CPS press release touting the study’s findings omits mention of other information contained in the report that provides more context. Test scores among CPS’ third- through eighth-graders are indeed growing faster on average than the average growth rate in 96 percent of districts nationwide, according to the Stanford study. But the report also found that students in the district, which remains beset by large achievement gaps between students of different racial and socioeconomic groups, still generally perform between one-half and one-and-a-half grade levels below the national average. CPS’ claim is accurate as far as it goes, but ignores the significant gap in achievement its students still must overcome. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-13006	Says U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi said, "Employers cutting hours is a good thing. It then gives that person time to pursue their dreams and passions."	false	/punditfact/statements/2016/dec/12/turning-point-usa/facebook-image-revives-made-claim-nancy-pelosi-pra/	Just days after winning another term as House Democratic leader, U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California was the target of a viral image that deliberately — and falsely — made it appear she said losing work shifts was a good thing for Americans. Conservative group Turning Point USA attacked Pelosi in a Dec. 8, 2016, Facebook post that showed her face next to a quote that read, "Employers cutting hours is a good thing. It then gives that person time to pursue their dreams and passions." No context is given for when or why Pelosi may have said that, and we can’t find any evidence she ever did. But the post was shared widely on social media nonetheless, including a popular thread on Reddit. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com It appears that the image is a misquote from a Sept. 22, 2013, State of the Union interview Pelosi gave to Candy Crowley on CNN. Not only did Pelosi not use the words being attributed to her, but the entire context of the conversation is lost. Crowley was asking Pelosi whether she had any reservations about the federal insurance exchange that was about to open for customers for the first time. HealthCare.gov was slated to debut Oct. 1, 2013. Some people worried that employers would limit shifts for many hourly workers in order to meet the Affordable Care Act requirement that employees who worked more than 30 hours had to have insurance coverage. (For the record, there’s a bit of evidence that some companies did cut hours after the advent of Obamacare, but it’s difficult to pinpoint why.) Here’s the transcript of that portion of the interview, with video posted here: CROWLEY: "Let me ask you then about Obamacare, itself. Coming up for a big date on Obamacare, October 1, when people can begin to sign up through the marketplaces. Do you have any reservations at all? Are you worried at all? And I ask you this because you know union leaders, I mean, James Hoffa is one of those who wrote a letter to you and said Obamacare as it now stands would, quote, ‘destroy the foundation of the 40-hour work week.’ That's pretty tough from a loyal Democratic constituency." PELOSI: "Well, we're working on the issue that relates to all of these multiemployer plans, which unions are one and some are charities." CROWLEY: "Bargaining rights or otherwise risks. There's more than one employer involved in a contract." PELOSI: "More than one employer involved in a contract. And that has to be certainly clarified. There's just so much the president can do within the law. But there is some leeway to facilitate as we are in the Congress under the exchanges. So, I'm optimistic, because, we will find a path. But overwhelmingly for the American people, this is a liberation. This is life, healthy life, liberty, the freedom to pursue your happiness, which could be, follow your passion for good rather than follow your palate and be constrained by your policy. It's about wellness. It's about prevention, it's about a healthier America." So there was a discussion about employers potentially cutting hours, but at no time did Pelosi call that a good thing. What she did say was that the launch of HealthCare.gov was a good thing for Americans, because they would no longer have to stay in a certain job just to keep their insurance coverage. It’s a talking point Pelosi had used before, and was attacked over before. It also was misrepresented the same way in 2013. Pelosi spokeswoman Caroline Behringer confirmed that the House minority leader did not say the words attributed to her. "It is something we saw spread on the internet, but has no basis in reality," Behringer said. Our ruling A viral image quoted Pelosi as saying, "Employers cutting hours is a good thing. It then gives that person time to pursue their dreams and passions." This attack first came up in 2013, right before the federal insurance exchange opened. It looks to be a misquote based on a CNN interview, in which Pelosi was asked about employers potentially cutting workers’ hours to avoid having to buy them health insurance. Pelosi responded that Obamacare still "liberated" Americans, because workers had an option for affordable insurance beyond having to stay with an employer for the coverage. Those people would then be free to find a job they liked better and still be covered, she said. The image not only puts words in her mouth, it deliberately twists the meaning of what she really said. We rate it False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cc6536c8-cfef-43fc-ac0b-75710840ed30	None	Turning Point USA	None	None	None	2016-12-12T18:05:00	2016-12-08	['Nancy_Pelosi', 'United_States']
pomt-05675	Says "over 1 million signatures" were submitted in attempt to recall Gov. Scott Walker.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/mar/15/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/democrats-say-more-1-million-signatures-were-submi/	The Democratic Party of Wisconsin declared on Jan. 17, 2012 that it had submitted to the state elections board more than 1 million signatures on petitions to recall Republican Gov. Scott Walker. That figure -- far exceeding the 540,208 signatures of "eligible electors" needed to force Walker into a recall election -- was proudly proclaimed by Democratic chairman Mike Tate in an online video. "I can announce that your grassroots movement, right now, is delivering to the Government Accountability Board over 1 million signatures collected to recall Scott Walker," he said. "This represents nearly double, or 185 percent, of the total required. It is simply breathtaking." The party said it had submitted more than 1 million signatures even after removing an undisclosed number that were duplicates, illegible or seemingly fake. It repeatedly cited the figure, including at a news conference, in a blog post and in statements. So did other groups such as United Wisconsin, which participated in the signature gathering, and the web site RecallScottWalker.com. So did commentators and reporters. But until the Government Accountability Board reviewed the petitions, there was no official account of just how many signatures had been submitted. The key question, of course, is whether there are 540,208 valid signatures. The board is continuing its review, although even Republicans expect there will be enough valid signatures for a Walker recall election to be held later in 2012. Nevertheless, many readers have asked us about the eye-popping 1 million claim, noting that it has become an awful catchy shorthand for success. On March 12, 2012, the Government Accountability Board announced that 931,042 signatures had been submitted to recall Walker. That’s a lot of signatures, but not 1 million. On the day the GAB announced its official figure, a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reporter asked state Democratic Party spokesman Graeme Zielinski in an email why there was a difference of nearly 69,000 between the number of signatures the party announced and the number counted by the elections board. Zielinski replied he didn’t know, then backtracked, calling the "over 1 million" claim an estimate. Said Zielinski: "Nobody knows how many signatures were submitted because of the sheer volume and the way the signatures were counted in the closing days. That's why we estimated our total." But the number was never presented as an estimate. What’s more, the party and United Wisconsin said they created their own database of the signatures before submitting them to the state board. (Tea party groups have released what they say is a searchable databases of recall petitions filed against four Republican state senators, and have said they would release one for the Walker. A Journal Sentinel review of a random sampling of 500 Walker recall signatures found that 15 percent of them could not be verified, indicating there still would be enough valid signatures to force an election.) We emailed Zielinski the day after the state board announced its figure, to see if he had anything more for us to consider. He said the party stands by its more than 1 million claim, but again called it an estimate. He also said the board’s count doesn't include "rehabilitated signature affidavits and may not have included thousands of signatures where Rebecca Kleefisch signatures were mixed with Scott Walker signatures." The board has counted 842,860 submitted signatures on petitions to recall Kleefisch, the GOP lieutenant governor, in what essentially is a joint effort to remove both Walker and Kleefisch from office. We asked Government Accountability Board spokesman Reid Magney about Zielinski’s comments. The board’s count of 931,042 is the "raw number" of signatures submitted by the Walker recall committee, Magney said. So, it would include "rehabilitated" signatures -- those that were put on a petition that contained a minor flaw and which the Democrats attempted to correct with an affidavit. Because no challenges were filed against any signatures, the GAB staff did not review the correcting affidavits. As for mixing petitions, Magney said that approximately 200 signatures on Kleefisch recall petitions were mistakenly included with petitions seeking to recall Walker, and they would have been counted in the raw number of Walker signatures, but those signatures would have been later struck by the staff. About 95 Walker recall signatures were mistakenly included with Kleefisch petitions, he said. Bottom line: Nothing Zielinski cited calls the board’s 931,042 count into question in any serious way. Conversely, he provided no evidence to show that more than 1 million signatures were submitted. Our rating The Democratic Party of Wisconsin claimed it submitted to the state elections board "over 1 million signatures" to recall Walker -- a claim that has been repeated and repeated. The board said just over 931,000 signatures were submitted. We rate the party’s statement False.	None	Democratic Party of Wisconsin	None	None	None	2012-03-15T11:08:21	2012-01-17	['None']
pomt-14259	States with "the highest gun ownership rates also have the highest suicide rates."	true	/virginia/statements/2016/apr/11/myra-signer/myra-signer-says-state-highest-gun-ownership-rates/	Former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., who was gravely wounded in a 2011 mass shooting near Tucson, recently visited Virginia’s Capitol to push for tougher gun laws. She and her husband, retired astronaut Mark Kelly, launched a coalition that will seek "common-sense solutions" to gun violence in the state. High on its list is convincing a resistant General Assembly to close loopholes in Virginia’s background check law for prospective gun buyers. About a dozen community leaders and law-enforcement experts met with Giffords and Kelly to help set strategies. Among them was Mira Signer, executive director of the Virginia chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness. She said the availability of guns poses special risks to those with mental disorders. States "that have the highest gun ownership also have the highest suicide rates," she said. "The evidence is there. We know that." We wondered whether Signer’s statement is correct. Signer told us her claim is based in part on a report called "The Truth About Guns and Suicide," published in September 2015 by the Brady Center & Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, a nonprofit advocating gun control. The report says, "Studies examining firearm ownership and suicide rates at the national, state and regional levels provide further evidence of the firearm-suicide connection. They show that suicide rates, both overall and by firearm, are higher in areas where gun ownership is more widespread." Footnotes in the report say the Brady Center’s statement is based on a series of studies by the Harvard Injury Control Research Center in Massachusetts - the last published in 2008. Researchers compared data that the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention kept from 2000 to 2002 on the number of suicides in each state and the percentage of households in each state where at least one firearm was held. "Among men, among women, and in every age group (including children), states with the higher rates of household gun ownership had higher rates of firearm suicides and overall suicides," the researchers wrote in an article published by The New England Journal of Medicine. Back then Why rely today on statistics that are more than decade old? Researchers say they’re still the best numbers available. Every year, the CDC conducts an extensive health-risk poll with more than 250,000 U.S. adults that ‘s called the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. It used to ask participants whether they had guns in their homes. With its huge sample, the results could be broken down to statistically reliable percentages of households with a gun in each state. The CDC, under congressional demands to stop researching gun issues, removed the question from the survey after 2004. Since then, no other poll has offered a reliable, detailed look at gun ownership rates in each state. The CDC surveys showed that the top three states for percentage of household gun ownership - Wyoming, Montana and Alaska - often ranked as the three states with the highest suicide rates. Roughly 60 percent of households held firearms in those states, much higher than the national median of 40 percent. Their suicide rates, according to other CDC data, hovered around 20 people per 100,000 - nearly double the national average of about 11 per 100,000. Conversely, the nine states with the lowest per-household gun ownership from 2001 to 2004 also had the nine lowest suicide rates. They were Hawaii, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, California, Illinois and Maryland. Overall, the statistics show a distinct correlation between gun ownership and suicide rates in states. There are, of course, anomalies. Nevada, for example, ranked 36th in the percentage of households with guns from 2001 to 2004 but had fourth-highest suicide rate. Virginia, if you’re wondering, ranked 32nd in the percentage of household with guns and 34th in suicide rate during that period. Today Signer’s statement was made in present tense, so there’s an issue of whether these old findings remain relevant. The ranking of states based on suicide rates barely has changed over the years, according CDC data for 2013 - the latest final statistics available. Wyoming, Alaska and Montana still had the highest rates. So that leaves the problem on quantifying household gun ownership in each state without updated, exhaustive surveys from the CDC. YouGov, an international market research firm, conducted an Internet poll in 2013 that asked 4,622 U.S. adults to participate in an online survey that asked whether they owned guns. YouGov broke the numbers down by state and got results that broadly resembled the CDC figures. Columbia University researchers used those figures in a 2013 paper on the gun culture in states and regions around the U.S. Bindu Kalesan, the lead researcher, told us in an email that the numbers for many states have a high margin of error. Many analysts, in exploring a variety of gun issues, still cite the CDC state figures. David Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center, told us the numbers still are relevant. "Gun ownership levels across states hardly change over time," he said. "For example, the best predictors of whether you will own a gun is whether you grew up with guns and whether your neighbors are gun owners or not." These indicators, Hemenway said, "don’t switch back and forth." Hemenway sent us four studies from other researchers that also connected the presence of guns to high suicide rates. "It all makes sense psychologically," he said, "since so many suicides are pretty spontaneous with little planning and people use whatever is handy. The urge passes and people who have survived even serious suicide attempts rarely go on to kill themselves. The case fatality rate for guns is 90 percent, while the case fatality rate for the two most common forms of suicide attempts - pills and cutting - is under 3 percent." Our ruling Signer said states that have "the highest gun ownership rates also have the highest suicide rates." Exhaustive data collected by the CDC at the start of the century supports her statement. The three states with the highest percentage of household gun ownership - Alaska, Wyoming and Montana - also had the three highest suicide rates. The correlation between the availability of guns and suicide rates, while not as exact across the nation, certainly existed in most other states. The nine states with the lowest household gun rates also had the lowest suicide rates. The ranking of states by their suicide rates barely has changed over the years. But the CDC has stopped surveying gun ownership in states, and nothing nearly as reliable has filled the void. A much smaller poll conducted in 2013 suggests the ranking of states by the percentage of homes with guns hasn’t changed much either. And there’s no shortage of researchers, past and present, who have concluded there is a strong link between the presence of guns and suicides. So we rate Signer’s statement True.

pomt-13588	Says the director of an anti-abortion group receiving a Texas grant to provide women’s health services "believes HIV can be spread through the sewer system."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2016/aug/17/joaquin-castro/joaquin-castro-says-conservative-activist-believes/	After word surfaced that a conservative nonprofit won a $1.6 million state grant to deliver women’s health services, U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro questioned the decision while making a "sewer" claim about the group’s director. Castro, D-San Antonio, said in an August 2016 tweet: "The group's director believes HIV can be spread through the sewer system. Is it really most qualified for the grant?" Human Immunodeficiency Virus, which causes AIDS, is mainly spread through sexual contact or from sharing needles, syringes, rinse water or other equipment with someone who has the virus, according to a federal website focused on AIDS. Less commonly, per the site, the virus may be spread from mother to child during pregnancy, by being stuck with an HIV-contaminated needle and, in rare cases, via blood transfusions and eating food pre-chewed by an HIV-infected person. We spotted no mention of the virus getting conveyed from anything in a sewer pipe. "HIV does not survive long outside the human body (such as on surfaces) and it cannot reproduce outside a human host," the site says. The virus also isn’t spread by air or water, the site says. Seeking Castro’s factual backup, we heard from his House spokeswoman, Erin Hatch, who emailed us web links to summer 2016 news stories--including an Austin American-Statesman story posted earlier the day of Castro’s tweet about Carol Everett, chief executive of the Round Rock-based Heidi Group, which once ran no-charge crisis pregnancy centers in Dallas advising women with unplanned pregnancies about giving birth. Everett, the story said, "recently came under scrutiny for suggesting during a fetal tissue disposal hearing that sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV, could be transmitted through the sewer system." Everett told the paper, though, that her highlighted comments had been misunderstood. Everett also told reporter Julie Chang that her remarks about HIV amounted to "a stupid mistake." Chang shared with us her notes from her interview with Everett, who said: "I very much regret what I said. I shouldn’t have even tried… because they misunderstood it. I didn’t talk about transmitting STDs that way. I was trying to talk about the fact that babies are ground up and put into these garbage disposals which goes into our sewers. I didn’t make that point very clearly." Existing regulations allow fetal remains, as with other medical tissue, to be ground and discharged into a sewer system, incinerated or disinfected followed by disposal in a landfill, or "an approved alternate treatment process, provided that the process renders the item as unrecognizable, followed by deposition in a sanitary landfill." Two instances For our part, we confirmed from a TV news report noted by Hatch and Chang’s recording of Everett’s comments before a state agency that she indeed made mention of HIV and sewers while advocating for state officials to adopt a rule requiring fetal remains to be buried or cremated rather than disposed other ways. The rule was proposed in June 2016 by the executive commissioner of the Texas Health and Human Services Commission on behalf of the Department of State Health Services; it wasn’t finalized as of Aug. 17, 2016. Chang’s recording of Everett’s comments at an Aug. 4, 2016 state hearing on the proposed rule show Everett expressed criticism of current disposal methods, further saying: "What does this really do to the public? There are other people to consider. "What if one of those sewer treatment programs breaks down one day? You know, the abortion industry doesn’t have time; they only see a woman one time; they do not do an AIDS test, they don’t do, they don’t know if she’s HIV-positive. They don’t know if she has a sexually transmitted disease. And what if one day, just one day, something horrible escaped into the sewer system?" (Laughter.) "It may sound funny but it’s something we could think about because I can tell you today, the public is thinking about it. "So I appreciate very much addressing this. I encourage you to uphold it. Let’s take care of those who cannot take care of themselves -- and I am talking about the women." Earlier, as pointed out by Hatch, Everett said in an interview with Austin’s Fox 7 aired July 7, 2016, that existing protocols for disposing fetal remains pose "several health concerns. What if the woman had HIV? What if she had a sexually transmitted disease? What if those germs went through and got into our water supply?" Everett said. When we reached Everett about Castro's claim, she said by phone she hadn’t explicitly said HIV is spread through sewer pipes--and doesn’t believe as much. "People with HIV and AIDS go to the bathroom every day," Everett said. At the state hearing, she said, she was trying to stress that fetal material gets into the sewer system. Everett called her comment to Austin’s Fox 7 about HIV/STD "germs" getting into "our" water supply "really far out. I shouldn’t have said that." Our ruling Castro said Everett "believes HIV can be spread through the sewer system." Everett didn’t explicitly say as much and told us she doesn’t believe it. However, on two occasions, she raised the "what-if" spectre of a woman somehow passing along the virus or an STD through fetal material flushed down a drain. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-01784	"The fundraising numbers are in, and our grassroots support is unmatched!"	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jul/27/glenn-grothman/glenn-grothman-says-he-leads-grassroots-financial-/	When Republican moderate Tom Petri retires next year, his successor in Congress is likely to be a more conservative member of the party. Four Republicans are battling for the party’s nomination, and fundraising will help determine who emerges from the Aug. 12, 2014 primary in Wisconsin’s 6th Congressional District. The winner will take on Democrat Mark Harris. When state Sen. Glenn Grothman’s mid-year campaign fund balance trailed two of his Republican rivals for the seat, he put a positive spin on his showing. "The fundraising numbers are in, and our grassroots support is unmatched!" he wrote in a Facebook post on July 16, 2014. Grothman, of Campbellsport, says it is smaller donations from Wisconsin that define his stronger "grassroots" support when compared to better-funded rivals Joe Leibham, a state senator from Sheboygan, and Duey Stroebel, a state representative from Saukville. We wondered if Grothman really has an edge among regular Joes and Janes giving $1 to $199 at a time in contrast to the deep-pockets givers. So we did what we do -- crunched the numbers. We trained our calculator mainly on Leibham, who raised $302,940 so far in 2014, and Grothman, who’s taken in $147,638. That’s because Grothman clearly has more financial support from regular folks than Stroebel ($368,206), who’s mainly using his own money, and than Tom Denow of the Oshkosh area, whose scant fundraising did not require reporting. We found a virtual dead heat between Grothman and Leibham on some indicators of small-bore support -- but better news for Leibham on key bottom-line measures. To the numbers: Concentration of Wisconsin support: More than 99 percent of Grothman’s donors are from the Badger State, compared with Leibham at 98.1 percent. A broader way to look at it is donations, not just donors (some donors give multiple times). By that measure, Leibham and Grothman each got between 98 and 99 percent from Badger State residents. Concentration of small givers: Slightly more than 76 percent of Grothman’s individual donations were $100 or less. The comparable figure for Leibham: just over 75 percent. Again, basically even. On donations of under $200 -- the threshold at which the Federal Election Commission allows candidates not to itemize donors by name -- Grothman had a larger advantage: 79 percent to 74 percent. (Leibham discloses names and other information on all donations; Grothman, as is true for many candidates, discloses smaller donations only as a lump-sum number, as the FEC allows. He shared additional detail with us for this story. The candidates’ fundraising reports are on the FEC website.) Money total from small givers: Leibham ran ahead of Grothman on total funds from those giving $100 or less per donation, $46,000 to $41,000. Number of small and in-state donations: Leibham attracted almost 200 more sub-$101 contributions than Grothman, and about 300 more total donations from Wisconsinites. Big money donations: Leibham gets a slightly larger share of his contributions from people giving $1,000 or more. In short, the pair get basically the same, very large share of their support from in-state donors and from small donations, but Leibham does more volume. Grothman campaign spokesman Brandon VerVelde told us Grothman should get credit for winning straw polls at GOP events. Perhaps he should, but the candidate’s statement was about fundraising. Our rating Grothman boasted that, "The fundraising numbers are in, and our grassroots support is unmatched!" But the numbers show that Leibham matched or out-did Grothman on most measures. That reads as pretty matched to us. We rate Grothman’s claim False.	None	Glenn Grothman	None	None	None	2014-07-27T05:00:00	2014-07-15	['None']
pomt-07097	Says that Sherrod Brown "voted to cut Medicare by over $500 billion in order to fund government-run health care."	false	/ohio/statements/2011/jun/23/national-republican-senatorial-committee/nrsc-claims-sen-sherrod-brown-voted-cut-500-billio/	When Sen. Sherrod Brown spoke at a Youngstown senior center against a Republican proposal to convert Medicare to a voucher system, the National Republican Senatorial Committee had a ready response. The NRSC revised and reissued a three-day-old news release that targeted virtually identical statements at Brown, of Ohio, and four other senators who all are Democrats up for re-election next year: Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Jon Tester of Montana, Ben Cardin of Maryland and Bill Nelson of Florida. "Despite Sherrod Brown's transparent political strategy to mislead Ohio seniors and demagogue Medicare, this serves as another reminder he is the only candidate in Ohio who has voted to cut Medicare by over $500 billion in order to fund government-run health care," said NRSC spokesman Jahan Wilcox. Wilcox cited the New York Times, Washington Post and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office as supporting sources. PolitiFact has examined at least four previous claims that the health care reform bill -- formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and informally tagged as Obamacare -- would cut Medicare by $500 billion. The important point in each examination is that $500 billion -- the figure confirmed by the NRSC's citations -- are not taken out of the current Medicare budget and are not actual cuts. Nowhere in the bill are benefits actually eliminated, experts said. The $500 billion are reductions to future spending. The health care law attempts to slow the projected growth in Medicare spending by that amount over 10 years. Medicare spending will still increase. The Congressional Budget Office estimated it will reach $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in actual spending in 2009. Some of the changes in the health care law increase Medicare spending "to improve benefits and coverage, Tricia Neuman, director of the Medicare Policy Project at the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation told PolitiFact. Other provisions reduce the growth in Medicare spending by helping the program operate more efficiently and fund coverage expansions to the uninsured. Other provisions are designed to improve the delivery of care and quality of care, she said. The projected $500 billion in savings will come from changes that include higher insurance premiums for wealthier seniors, reductions in payments for Medicare Advantage plans, a new panel to oversee reimbursement rates, and a slowing of increases in payment rates to hospitals and other service providers each year. (Neuman explains the changes in a video tutorial on the Kaiser Family Foundation's website.) The NRSC recycled another talking point when it further asserts that the changes in the health care law will "fund government-run health care." PolitiFact has repeatedly issued Truth-O-Meter ratings of False or Pants on Fire for claims that the law represents a government takeover of health care. The claim was selected as PolitiFact National's 2010 Lie of the Year. We found that critics of the law are correct that it significantly increases government regulation of health insurers. But it is, as noted previously, a system that relies on private companies: Employers continue to provide health insurance to the majority of Americans through private insurance companies. More people will get private health coverage. The law sets up "exchanges" where private insurers will compete to provide coverage to people who don't have it. The government will not seize control of hospitals or nationalize doctors. The law does not include a government-run insurance plan that would compete with private insurers. The law gives tax credits to people who have difficulty affording insurance, so they can buy their coverage from private providers on the exchange. The NRSC’s claim cites a real figure -- $500 billion -- that is part of the health reform debate. But it incorrectly describes it as $500 billion in Medicare cuts, rather than as decreases in the rate of growth of future spending. And the NRSC piles on the incorrect talking point about "government-run health care." On the Truth-Meter, the NRSC’s claim rates as False.

pomt-13380	Says to Hillary Clinton, "You heard what I said about (the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal), and all of a sudden you were against it."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/27/donald-trump/donald-trump-my-trans-pacific-partnership-oppositi/	Criticism of U.S. trade deals has been a key theme in Donald Trump's campaign, and during the Sept. 26, 2016, debate against Hillary Clinton, he focused on two. First, he criticized Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, for signing the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Trump also accused Clinton of wanting to approve a newer proposal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the largest regional trade deal in history. NAFTA was bad, Trump said, "And now you want to approve (the) Trans-Pacific Partnership. You were totally in favor of it. Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, 'I can't win that debate.' But you know that if you did win, you would approve that." Clinton said that "is just not accurate" and argued that she decided to oppose it once the terms of the deal were known. Trump said she had praised the deal "and then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it." "Well, Donald," Clinton responded, "I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts." We wondered about the timing. Did Clinton change her mind in response to Trump's criticism of the TPP? We found no evidence to support Trump's claim. Even before he was a candidate, Trump was on record as opposing the TPP. As early as April 2015, he predicted it would hurt U.S. businesses and put people out of work. The terms of the deal were finalized on Oct. 5, 2015. Clinton announced her opposition on Oct. 7, two days later. At the time, she was under pressure to oppose the pact, but that pressure wasn't from Trump. On Oct. 7, Trump was only one of 15 Republicans still seeking the GOP nomination. The first presidential primary was five months away, Trump's poll numbers among Republicans were around 23 percent. Many people thought his lead in the polls was largely based on name recognition. Most Republicans supported the deal, CNN reported in a story about Clinton's decision to oppose the TPP. Trump is listed as a notable exception. However, the topic didn't even come up during the first two GOP debates. More urgently, if Clinton was under any immediate pressure to oppose the TPP it was from her two top opponents in the Democratic primary — Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley. Like many Democrats, particularly those with strong union ties, both men opposed the TPP. Sanders called it "disastrous." O'Malley accused Clinton of switching on the eve of the first Democratic debate. At the time, Sanders was starting to gain momentum. His support in the polls had gone from 12 percent at the end of June to 25 percent in a Clinton-Sanders matchup, and support for Clinton had slipped nearly 20 points. There was also pressure from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. Her biggest concern, as she explained in a July 7, 2016 video, was that the TPP gave multinational companies special power "to challenge a country's laws they just don't like," including laws on pollution, safety, health and food. We emailed a half dozen people in the Trump campaign seeking evidence that Trump's opposition caused Clinton to change her mind. We didn't hear back. Our ruling Trump told Clinton, "You heard what I said about (the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal), and all of a sudden you were against it." There's no evidence for cause and effect here, and the Trump campaign hasn't provided any. Clinton says her opposition is based solely on the terms of the proposed pact and her announcement to oppose it came two days after the TPP was finalized. Even if political considerations drove her decision, most of the pressure on Clinton was within her own party, particularly from Bernie Sanders, as she saw her support among Democrats slipping. Based on the available evidence, we rate Trump's claim as False.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/eef8af26-f463-4b75-ad92-d01bd602af43	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-09-27T17:14:54	2016-09-26	['Hillary_Rodham_Clinton']
pomt-09155	Says an estimate that Texas will face an $18 billion budget gap is “a number that somebody just reached up in the air and grabbed."	false	/texas/statements/2010/jun/09/rick-perry/perry-says-18-billion-budget-gap-estimate-plucked-/	Seven months before the Texas Legislature convenes to begin work on the state's next two-year budget, Gov. Rick Perry was asked his assessment of the state budget gap likely to confront lawmakers. "How big do you estimate that the state's budget shortfall will be?" reporter Martin Bartlett of Austin's KVUE-TV asked in an interview posted online June 4. "... We've heard that estimate, $18 billion. That is a big number." Perry replied: "It is a big number. And I think it's a number that somebody just reached up in the air and grabbed." Perry, noting he's been around state government for a spell, went on: "May of 2011 is when we are really going to get down to the lick log, and to be trying to estimate what the Texas economy is going to be, particularly in this economic climate that we're in, I think is an effort in futility and not very wise by those who are trying to do those estimates." We wondered what the heck a lick log is -- oh, and whether Perry was on the mark when he characterized the $18 billion estimate as free-floating, so to speak. For starters, we're presuming that "budget gap" refers to the expected gulf during 2012-13 between state spending demands and revenue the state can count on to meet them. As for lick log, the Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slang says a lick log is a “salt lick for cattle.” The phrase “down to the lick log” means to get “down to business.” So, Perry’s perspective appears to be that the financial picture won't be clear until May 2011, about when negotiators for the House and Senate are likely to draw up the final budget that ends up being sent to the governor. When we contacted Perry's office about his "up in the air" statement, spokeswoman Allison Castle pointed out that state Comptroller Susan Combs has not yet released a 2012-13 revenue estimate and also agencies have not made appropriation requests. Some budgetary background: Every odd-numbered year, lawmakers start drafting the budget with instructions from the state comptroller on how much revenue the state expects to earn during the next two years; that forecast determines how much the state has to spend. Unlike the federal government's, the budget has to balance, with the state spending no more than it takes in. When Perry was asked about the $18 billion figure on KVUE, Bartlett did not mention a source for the number. The Austin American-Statesman's budget reporter, Kate Alexander, nudged us to review the May 11 meeting of the House Appropriations Committee, whose members will get first crack at writing the budget. At the meeting, according to a video recording posted online by the Texas House, committee Chairman Jim Pitts, R-Waxahachie, quizzed Wayne Pulver, assistant director of the Legislative Budget Board, about the reasons that the state is facing a budget gap. Pitts introduced Pulver by noting the board does forecasting and is keeping the committee informed about "what we might be looking at as far as the shortfall." Established in 1949, the board is charged with many budgetary responsibilities, including preparation of a draft of the budget bill for legislators each session; its analysts produce the numbers that inform legislative spending decisions. At the hearing, Pulver signed off on Pitts' conclusion that lawmakers will start with a budget gap because of funds that will no longer be available from sizable sources that helped balance the 2010-11 budget: $6.4 billion in federal stimulus money and $5.6 billion in one-time state funds. Those figures jibe with an analysis the budget board produced in March for the committee and was laid out by John O'Brien, the board's executive director. O'Brien pegged the budget gap at $11 billion, but cautioned that his figure assumed no growth in state spending or revenue. At the May hearing, Pulver detailed factors expected to increase the shortfall, including that revenue could fail to meet projections and that spending may increase to accommodate growth in demand for programs like Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program. Pitts then asked: "So that could add up to between $15 and $18 billion?" Pulver called that number "reasonable." At a May 25 meeting of the House Ways and Means committee, Chairman Rene Oliveira, D-Brownsville, got into more nitty-gritty. Citing a staff analysis, Oliveira said the expected gap could be reduced thanks to $1.2 billion in cuts to the current budget ordered by state leaders. Also, he said, the state could reap more than $3 billion in additional revenue transferred from the state's public education endowment and in federal Medicaid aid. But Oliveira also said the state could be facing new costs, such as: * $2.5 billion for Medicaid, primarily because of increased enrollment linked both to the economic downturn * $3.4 billion for public and higher education, primarily because of projected enrollment increases * $200 million for prisons, including increased health care costs A final factor in Oliveira’s analysis: revenue collections that he said could leave the state $3 billion to $6 billion short of projections. When all is said and done, Oliveira's budget gap estimate ends up at about $18 billion. J.J. Garza, Oliveira's chief of staff, later told us that he prepared Oliveira's analysis in consultation with the staff of Texas House Speaker Joe Straus, R-San Antonio, the Legislative Budget Board, and government and private-sector economists. Straus has also cited the budget gap, writing in a June 1 opinion piece in the Austin American-Statesman that "recent estimates project the state budget shortfall could be as much as $18 billion." Tracy Young, a spokeswoman for Straus, told us the speaker was referring to the same figures discussed by Pitts and Pulver. She described the source of the numbers as a combination of information from the LBB, state comptroller's office and the speaker's policy staff. As for the legitimacy of the $18 billion figure, we found a common cautionary caveat. There is still a lot of time for the number to change, especially if the economy takes a dramatic turn -- in either direction. In prepared remarks for the May 25 committee meeting, Oliveira said "the numbers can move by hundreds of millions over the next few months." He continued: "If the recovery is stronger, then (tax) collections would improve, our Medicaid burden would probably shrink ... and the revenue estimate for next session would be higher," which would shrink the gap. Sen. Steve Ogden, R-Bryan, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, told the San Antonio Express-News in April that the budget gap couldn't yet be defined "because you don't know -- when you say shortfall, you imply some sort of mandatory spending level and some sort of predetermined revenue level, neither of which we have. There's no shortfall if you don't spend it. And we don't know yet what our revenue projections are." Despite that, Dale Craymer, president of the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association -- which represents several hundred largely Texas-based businesses and legal and accounting firms -- said that making budget projections is a "healthy part of the process; we do need to constantly be looking forward." Craymer said that without projections, for example, state leaders might not have decided to call for the recent cuts to the state's current budget. So how does Perry's statement shake out? It's downright flighty. Projections may be uncertain, but that doesn't mean they're pulled from the air, as Perry told KVUE. The $18 billion budget gap figure has been cited by state leaders using the best information they now have available. And an official at the budget board, whose staffers are longstanding experts on number-crunching, called that figure "reasonable" before Perry piped up. We rate Perry's statement as False.

pomt-08849	Says Bill White "profiteered in the aftermath of Hurricane Rita."	false	/texas/statements/2010/aug/09/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-bill-white-profiteered-hurricane-r/	A headline on one of GOP Gov. Rick Perry’s campaign websites underscores Perry’s criticism of Democratic nominee Bill White’s business dealings. White, the headline on liberalbill.org says, "profiteered in the aftermath of Hurricane Rita." That's a powerful charge -- worthy fodder for the Truth-O-Meter. First, let’s check "profiteer," which means someone "who makes excessive profits, especially by taking advantage of a shortage of supply to charge exorbitant prices," according to Webster’s New World College Dictionary. The verb simply means to be a profiteer. Robert Prentice, a professor at the University of Texas McCombs School of Business, told us the word applies to someone who overcharges in instances of short supply or who simply seeks excess profits. In a nutshell, Perry’s campaign says White profiteered after the hurricane hit the Gulf Coast near the Texas-Louisiana line in September 2005 because, it says, he had financial connections — before and while he was mayor — with a company that got an emergency contract to provide six electrical generators to a Houston-area water authority for three months. In a June 10, 2010, press conference, White, who was mayor of Houston from 2004 through 2009, countered that he had no financial interest in the company -- BTEC Turbines -- at the time of the storm and hadn’t acted improperly when he encouraged the company to pitch in for the Coastal Water Authority, which supplies water to Houston, Baytown and Deer Park and dozens of industrial customers. (Its board of directors has seven members -- four appointed by the mayor of Houston and three by the governor.) The total amount paid by the authority to BTEC: about $1.9 million. The Federal Emergency Management Agency reimbursed the authority for nearly all the money spent on the generator contract, which was needed after the storm knocked out power to a pump station that sends water from the Trinity River to a reservoir near Baytown. White spoke on the issue a day after personal income tax returns he released showed that he later made hundreds of thousands of dollars from investing in the Houston company. Don Moore, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California-Berkeley, said that for White's post-hurricane investment in BTEC to be interpreted as profiteering, White would have had to know two things in fall 2005: that he would join the investment in BTEC "in the near future" and that the firm's contract with the authority would "increase the sweetness" of that deal. Katy Bacon, spokeswoman for White's campaign, said he did not have advance knowledge of the investment opportunity. We scoured documents cited by Perry’s campaign, minutes from Coastal Water Authority board meetings and a packet of documents provided by Vinson & Elkins, the authority’s outside lawyers, for indications that either BTEC or White acted as profiteers from the emergency contract. What we found: Two members of the authority’s board of directors, Darryl King and Rick Cloutier, questioned the contract costs at the board’s October 2005 meeting. According to board minutes, Cloutier said the generators could be purchased for the same cost as renting them. The authority has since made a plan to buy back-up generators. On Aug. 4, 2010, the Associated Press reported that Mayor White later encouraged the authority to settle up with BTEC after the authority disputed some charges that it thought were too high. A final payment was arranged about eight months before White invested in BTEC. The authority ended up paying BTEC about $264,000 of more than $424,000 in disputed charges, according to the AP story. Cloutier, now a senior vice president with engineering and construction firm CDM in Houston, told us that after Rita hit, the board was pleased that the authority could get the equipment because "it was awful hard to come across generators at that time." He said the dispute between the authority and BTEC dealt with another aspect of the contract, the purchase and storage of diesel fuel that the authority didn't use because power was restored a few days after the storm. "It didn’t make sense to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for fuel and maintenance folks that we didn’t need," Cloutier said. So, why didn’t the authority end its BTEC deal as soon as power was restored? Cloutier said the board didn’t think that was an option. "We were being held to the terms of the contract," he said. Clark Lord of Vinson & Elkins, an outside lawyer for the authority, declined to discuss generator costs. But John Agnes, a salesman for Mustang CAT, which sells generators in the Houston area, told us the $252,000 monthly generator rental charge in the authority’s BTEC contract is roughly equivalent to what his company would charge for providing such generators in a period of high demand. The rest of the authority’s costs, about $1.2 million, were associated with installation, supporting equipment, personnel and fuel. (In October 2005, the authority’s board backed a resolution approving the agreement with BTEC and said the costs were not to exceed $2 million.) Next, we explored White’s connections to BTEC both before and after the hurricane came ashore in September 2005. Perry’s campaign notes correctly that before becoming mayor, White served on BTEC’s board by virtue of his job as president and CEO of the Wedge Group, a private Houston investment company with interests in oil service companies, commercial real estate and hotels. The Wedge Group bought a 70 percent stake in BTEC in December 2001, according to a December 2001 Houston Business Journal report. After his election in 2003, White resigned from Wedge and the BTEC board. Wedge later severed its ties to BTEC; Richard Blohm, general counsel for the Wedge Group, told us that "it has been a few years since we had any ownership interest at all." How did White regain an interest in BTEC? In December 2006, White invested in BTEC through the Sterling Group, one of two private equity firms that bought a majority stake in the Houston company that year. Bacon told us that the Sterling Group contacted White to get his opinion about the company and White said he thought so highly of it that he would put his own money into it. The firm later took White up on that and invited him to invest, Bacon said. The AP reported Aug. 4 that White owns about 1 percent of BTEC. Through July 20, 2010, Bacon said, White had put $552,000 in cash and $324,480 in loans into the BTEC investment and received $1.25 million in cash back -- a gain of about $375,000. Perry’s "profiteer" case against White features two other financial connections -- a deferred-compensation account that was set up before White left Wedge in 2003 and payments White received from Wedge in 2005. Let’s look at the deferred-compensation account first. According to White’s personal tax returns from the years he was mayor, White received payments from the account each year from 2005 (about $82,000) through 2009 (about $84,000). Bacon told us the deferred-compensation account, held by a brokerage firm, was funded with income White earned while still at Wedge that was then invested in publicly traded stocks and mutual funds, not in BTEC or Wedge. She said the payments White received were not influenced by Wedge’s performance after 2003. What about the more than $3 million White reported receiving from Wedge in 2005? In a financial summary White released to reporters this year, that money is described as "contractual payments" based on gains from investments that White had managed for the company prior to 2004. Bacon told us none of the investments was related to BTEC. We checked back in with the Perry campaign about the profiteering charge. Spokesman Mark Miner said the history of White’s financial involvement with Wedge, BTEC and the 2005 authority contract proves White profiteered from Hurricane Rita. We disagree. Questions have certainly been raised about whether the authority paid too much for its deal with BTEC, but even if it did, that would serve as evidence that BTEC reaped excessive profits from the hurricane contract, not White. Whether White improperly intervened on behalf of BTEC to settle the contract matter is another issue, which isn't the statement we're reviewing. Upshot: White had a prior relationship with BTEC when he played a role in the company’s getting post-hurricane work and he later made what turned out to be a profitable investment in the company. Those decisions might open White to conflict-of-interest criticisms. However, Perry’s characterization of White as a profiteer doesn't bear out. We rate Perry's claim False.

pomt-01296	The "stand your ground" law caused the shooting death of Trayvon Martin.	false	/florida/statements/2014/oct/30/senate-majority-pac/radio-ad-dem-pac-blames-trayvon-martin-death-flori/	The shooting death of Trayvon Martin in Florida, which sparked a national discussion about "stand your ground" laws, has become ammunition in the North Carolina U.S. Senate race. The Senate Majority PAC, which aims to elect Democrats, ran a radio ad urging higher turnout among black voters. The ad attacks Thom Tillis, the Republican speaker of the North Carolina House, challenging Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan. The ad makes a series of claims about Tillis including this one: "Tillis even led the effort to pass the type of ‘stand your ground’ laws that caused the shooting death of Trayvon Martin." PolitiFact has fact-checked numerous claims related to the Trayvon Martin case. Did Florida’s "stand your ground" law cause his death? The radio ad was captured by the conservative blogger SisterToldjah and sparked considerable media attention. It prompted a conservative group to counterattack with a radio ad accusing the Democrats of "race baiting." While we are focused on the claim about whether Florida’s "stand your ground" law killed Trayvon, other media reports dissected Tillis’ role in the North Carolina law, which Tillis voted in favor of. Trayvon Martin and "stand your ground" law The fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin of Miami Gardens on Feb. 26, 2012, and the acquittal of George Zimmerman the following year ignited political debate over race, gun rights and Florida’s "stand your ground" law. The law, which was approved overwhelmingly by the Legislature and signed by Gov. Jeb Bush in 2005, allows people to use deadly force when they believe their life is at risk. The law, promoted by the National Rifle Association, now exists in about two dozen states. Trayvon, a black 17-year-old, was returning from a convenience store and walking through a gated neighborhood where he was staying with his father. Zimmerman, a white-Hispanic neighborhood watchman, called a non-emergency police number to report Trayvon as "suspicious." A violent struggle followed and Zimmerman shot and killed Trayvon. Zimmerman waived his right to a "stand your ground" hearing before trial, and did not cite it in his defense during the trial. But the law was cited in jury instructions: "If George Zimmerman was not engaged in an unlawful activity and was attacked in any place where he had a right to be, he had no duty to retreat and had the right to stand his ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he reasonably believed that it was necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony." In July 2013, the jury found Zimmerman not guilty of second-degree murder. After the verdict, Dan Gelber, a former federal prosecutor and state legislator from Miami Beach who was a critic of the law in 2005, wrote on his blog that jurors would have received different instructions under the old law, which said: "The defendant cannot justify the use of force likely to cause death or great bodily harm unless he used every reasonable means within his power and consistent with his own safety to avoid the danger before resorting to that force The fact that the defendant was wrongfully attacked cannot justify his use of force likely to cause death or great bodily harm if by retreating he could have avoided the need to use that force." (Gelber is now an adviser to Charlie Crist’s Democratic campaign for governor in Florida.) It’s difficult to quantify what extent "stand your ground" law played in the jury’s decision. One juror told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that the jury discussed the "stand your ground" law. "It became very confusing. We had stuff thrown at us. We had the second-degree murder charge, the manslaughter charge, then we had self-defense, ‘stand your ground,’ and I think there was one other one." The juror, who was unnamed, said the murder or manslaughter charge did not apply "because of the heat of the moment and the ‘stand your ground.’ " But while the "stand your ground" law could have played a role for the jury, the law itself didn’t pull the trigger in the shooting. It’s impossible to fully evaluate Zimmerman’s thinking when he shot Trayvon, but one factor could have been that Zimmerman was a wannabe cop -- he had been rejected for a job with the Prince William County, Va., police department. Racial profiling could have played a role; Trayvon was a black male teenager wearing a hoodie. And then we will mention the obvious: Zimmerman had a gun. Zimmerman said in a TV interview in 2012 he had never heard of "stand your ground" until after the shooting, though during the trial the prosecution presented evidence that Zimmerman took a criminal-litigation course in which the instructor said he covered the "stand your ground" law. Zimmerman received an "A" in the course in 2010. The Senate Majority PAC’s back-up for the ad cites an article in Mother Jones shortly after the acquittal, which points to Zimmerman taking that course: "In reality, ‘stand your ground’ played a major role, from Martin's death to Zimmerman's acquittal. ... An armed Zimmerman knew about ‘stand your ground’ years ago." A spokesman for the PAC, Ty Matsdorf, didn’t respond to PolitiFact’s questions other than sending us the ad backup. He gave a statement to the New York Times defending the ad in general terms. But two defense attorneys we interviewed argued that the "stand your ground" law itself didn’t play a provable role. "I don’t recall any evidence that he made a conscious decision to rely on the law before acting," said Kendall Coffey, a former U.S. Attorney in Miami now in private practice. " ‘Stand your ground’ may have led to the acquittal of George Zimmerman; that’s a more accurate statement. It’s led to other acquittals, too." "The law didn’t cause his death," said David Weinstein, a former state and federal prosecutor and now a Miami defense attorney. "The bullet that got fired by George Zimmerman’s gun is what caused Trayvon Martin’s death." After the Trayvon case, efforts to get rid of Florida’s "stand your ground" law went nowhere in the Republican-led Legislature. In fact, in 2014 the Legislature added that it applies to warning shots. The law has remained a hot topic nationwide, including in Florida’s race between Republican Gov. Rick Scott and Crist. During the Oct. 15 debate at Broward College, Scott said he would not change the law, while Crist said it is "fundamentally flawed" and needs to be fixed. Our ruling A Senate Majority PAC radio ad said, "Tillis even led the effort to pass the type of ‘stand your ground’ laws that caused the shooting death of Trayvon Martin." The part we focused on is whether Florida’s "stand your ground" law killed Trayvon. There are plenty of factors that could have contributed to George Zimmerman shooting Trayvon including racial profiling and his desire to be a law enforcement officer (not to mention the obvious: his access to a gun). And the "stand your ground" law could have influenced the jury’s decision to acquit Zimmerman of murder. However, it is an overstatement to suggest that the law is to blame for Trayvon’s death. We rate this claim False.	None	Senate Majority PAC	None	None	None	2014-10-30T16:04:52	2014-10-28	['None']
pomt-11946	"There have been more than 270 mass shootings in the United States in the last year alone. That’s where four or more are killed."	false	/california/statements/2017/oct/10/hillary-clinton/hillary-clintons-false-claim-mass-shootings/	Citing the Las Vegas shooting that killed 59 people and injured hundreds, Hillary Clinton urged the nation to do more to prevent gun violence during a speech at the University of California at Davis on Monday. The Democrat and former presidential candidate rejected the idea that a debate over gun safety should wait until well after a mass shooting takes place. "What better time than now?" Clinton said, speaking on her current book tour’s only scheduled stop in California. Clinton went on to make a claim about the number of mass shootings that have taken place this year — and misstated how they are defined. "There have been more than 270 mass shootings in the United States this year alone. That’s where four or more are killed. Two hundred and seventy. We cannot accept this as normal. We cannot become desensitized." Hillary Clinton made her claim about mass shootings during a speech Oct. 9, 2017 at UC Davis. PolitiFact California took a deep look at how mass shootings are defined here, and found there’s wide disagreement on the matter. Democrats and gun control advocates use the very broad criteria that a mass shooting includes four or more people killed — or injured — in one event. It was developed by the Gun Violence Archive, a group that logs shootings across the country by crowdsourcing media reports. Under its definition, which does not require that anyone is necessarily killed, there have been more than 270 mass shootings so far this year. But there have been far fewer of these crimes where, as Clinton termed it, "four or more people are killed." More restrictive criteria A database compiled by Mother Jones, a liberal magazine, shows there have been only three mass shootings so far this year that meet the four-or-more measurement expressed by Clinton at the speech. The magazine itself shows seven mass shootings so far this year because it uses three or more deaths as its criteria. It excludes more conventional crimes such as armed robberies and gang violence in its count, focusing instead on "the distinct phenomenon of mass shootings." The Gun Violence Archive, meanwhile, which includes gang shootings and home invasion robberies as mass shootings, had tallied 19 shootings in which four or more people were killed. In the past, the federal government has used the more restrictive criteria of four or more killed to define a mass shooting. We found there’s no widely accepted definition that doesn’t create its own share of questions. A spokesman for Clinton pointed to the Gun Violence Archive’s definition for mass shootings, but did not immediately provide an explanation for Clinton’s misstatement of that definition. Our ruling Hillary Clinton in her UC Davis speech said there have been more than 270 mass shootings in the United States so far this year. She defined the events as "where four or more are killed." Our research has shown that a broad definition of mass shootings requires four or more people to be killed or injured. There have been more than 270 of those horrific crimes so far this year. But Clinton left out the key words "or injured," dramatically changing the criteria for these shootings. There have been a much smaller number of mass shootings that meet this stricter criteria of "four or more people killed," nowhere near the 270 she claimed. We rate Clinton’s claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2017-10-10T15:51:26	2017-10-09	['United_States']
pomt-09092	"In fact, oil spills from tankers are far more common than the very rare leaks from rigs or pipelines."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2010/jun/24/eric-johnson/candidate-oil-spills-tankers-more-common-very-rare/	As the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico continues to threaten the coastline, Savannah's Eric Johnson, a Republican gubernatorial candidate, remains steadfast in his support for offshore drilling. He dedicated a blog post to his position on his campaign Web page. "Predictably, liberal activists call the Gulf disaster a warning of things to come if we expand drilling, but this incident is an unfortunate exception to the rule. The last major oil spill from a drilling accident in America happened over 40 years ago in 1969. In fact, oil spills from tankers are far more common than the very rare leaks from rigs or pipelines." An earlier PolitiFact item ruled that Johnson's claim that the last major oil spill from a drilling accident in America took place in 1969 was False. This one deals with whether oil spills from tankers are far more common than "very rare leaks" from rigs or pipelines. We looked at a 2009 report produced by the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, that catalogs oil spills. Indeed, the number of spills from tankers in U.S. waters is nearly two-and-a-half times higher than those of offshore oil pipelines and oil platforms combined. Tankers also dump more than three times more oil. Two scientists who study the ocean and environment also confirmed that tankers are responsible for more spills. Here's how the numbers from the American Petroleum Institute break down: U.S. offshore pipelines, 1969 to 2007: 506 spills, 182,355 barrels p24 U.S. platforms, 1969 to 2007: 1,035 spills, 277,033 barrels p24 Oil tankers in U.S. waters: 3,774 spills, 1962 through 2007; 1,596,638 barrels p31 U.S. Coast Guard figures on spills differ from API data but back up the overall point that tanker spills are far worse polluters than offshore oil pipelines or platforms. But are leaks from rigs or pipelines "very rare"? The petroleum industry's own figures indicate the U.S. has averaged more than 13 pipeline spills and 27 platform spills a year. They're certainly less common than tanker spills, as Johnson stated. But platform and pipeline spills still take place roughly 40 times annually. That's a little more than three times per month. That's not rare at all. That's chronic. We rule this claim Half True.	None	Eric Johnson	None	None	None	2010-06-24T06:00:00	2010-06-07	['None']
pomt-14801	While the smoking rate nationally has fallen, more than 18 percent of Georgians still light up.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2015/nov/30/atlanta-mayor-kasim-reeds-office/Statement-on-smoking-rates-needs-slightly-more-con/	Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed and more than two dozen health professionals launched a statewide campaign last week to help Georgia smokers kick the habit. The "Nobody Quits Like Georgia" campaign emphasized connecting smokers with the counseling and other support they need to quit successfully. "Atlanta and state-level health care leaders are taking action because while the national smoking rate has fallen, more than 18 percent of adults in Georgia are still smoking," Reed’s office said in a press release on Nov. 17. The health hazards of cigarette smoking have been publicly recognized at least since the mid1960s, so could almost one in five Georgia adults still be lighting up? PolitiFact decided to check. First, a little background. Health advocates have been pushing to reduce the national smoking rate among adults 18 and over to 12 percent by 2020. About 20.6 percent of American adults were smoking in 2009, but the percentage has dropped every year since. In 2013, 19 percent of adults, nationally, and 18.8 percent in Georgia, were smoking, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. The CDC says smoking leads to disease and disability and harms nearly every organ of the body. More than 16 million Americans are estimated to be living with a smoking-related disease. These include cancer, heart disease, stroke, lung disease, diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), according to the CDC. The financial toll of smoking is tremendous -- more than $300 billion a year in the United States alone. This includes about $170 billion in direct medical care for adults and more than $156 billion in lost productivity due to premature death and exposure to secondhand smoke, the federal agency estimates. So what about the city’s statement about the habit in Georgia? We started our fact-check by contacting Reed press secretary Jenna Garland. She told us the American Lung Association, lead sponsor of the campaign, provided the statistic that appeared in the press release. Searches of CDC statistics last week also verified that 18.8 percent of Georgia adults were identified as smokers in 2013, Garland said. "At the time of our press conference and release, this data was absolutely correct. And it is still the primary data presented by the CDC," she said. Garland is right -- for 2013. The picture is peachier for Georgia, however, based on newer data for 2014. That was available in a press release put out by the Georgia Department of Public Health on the same day that Reed’s office issued its statement. In 2014, Georgia’s adult smoking rate had fallen to 17.4 percent, down 1.4 percentage points from 2013 as measured on the Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System.(BRFSS). Particularly significant, the rate of smoking fell to 16.4 percent in young adults, ages 18 to 24, state officials said. National data from BRFSS for 2014 has not made public. We examined data gathered in the last 10 years on smoking rates in Georgia and the nation. You’ll see that smoking rates have been heading downward both in the state and nation throughout most, but not all of the decade. This is based on data collected by states through the Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and submitted by the CDC. Percentage of Adults 18 and over who smoke Year Georgia U.S. 2005 22.1 20.8 2006 19.9 20.5 2007 19.4 20 2008 19.5 19.7 2009 17.7 18.3 2010 17.6 17.9 2011 21.2 21.2 2012 20.4 19.6 2013 18.8 19 2014 17.4 Not available Source: Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) reports and Georgia Department of Public Health. --------------------- CDC spokeswoman Brittany Behm said that although the prevalence of smoking in Georgia has steadily declined in the past several years, the progress has not been as robust as it could have been. She said that’s largely because "interventions we know work have not been fully implemented." She said these include higher tobacco product prices, comprehensive smoke-free laws, hard-hitting mass media campaigns, and full and sustained funding for comprehensive tobacco control programs. "Statistically, Georgia ranks 24th among the states and DC—almost exactly at the median," Behm said. Jean O’Connor, director of chronic disease prevention for the Georgia Department of Public Health, said state officials believe they’ve made serious headway, particularly with the tobacco-free schools program that’s now in 105 of the state’s 181 school districts. Enabling 1.3 million students to spend their school day free from exposure to tobacco appears to be showing up in the numbers, O’Connor said. With the smoking rate falling to 16.4 percent in the 18-24 age group, "that tells us kids are aging up and not using tobacco products," she said. "If you can get to 25 without using, odds of being addicted are very very low." That’s reinforced in Georgia’s University System, one of the first in the nation to be smoke-free at its college and universities, O’Connor said. Our ruling A press release from Mayor Kasim Reed’s Office said: "Atlanta and state-level health care leaders are taking action because while the national smoking rate has fallen, more than 18 percent of adults in Georgia are still smoking." The first part of the statement is misleading. Smoking rates have generally been falling nationally and in Georgia. The state’s rate was lower than the national rate in 2013. Reed’s office is correct that, in 2013, 18.8 percent of Georgia adults over 18 were smoking. But newer figures paint a peachier picture for the state. It doesn’t change the mayor’s overarching point that the state still has a way to go. We rate Reed’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-03837	"In the period from 2007 to 2011, the Office of Health Insurance Commissioner reported an 18 percent decline in the state’s total medical spending."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/mar/16/joshua-miller/rhode-island-sen-joshua-miller-says-states-total-m/	In a March 1 news release, Sen. Joshua Miller, D-Cranston, announced a "landmark bill" representing the "next phase of health-care reform legislation in Rhode Island." Miller, chairman of the Senate Committee on Health and Human Services, said his bill builds on previous legislative work, including the creation of the Office of Health Insurance Commissioner in 2004, electronic records and payment reforms. "These efforts have begun to show significant progress in cost containment," Miller said in a news release. "In the period from 2007 to 2011, the Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner reported an 18 percent decline in the state’s total medical spending and an increase by insurers of 8 percent in medical claims dollars spent on primary care, up from 5.4 percent in 2007." Given all you hear about the rising cost of health care, PolitiFact Rhode Island was curious about the claim that Rhode Island’s total medical spending fell by 18 percent in that time frame. When we asked Miller to back up his claim, he cited a September 2012 report from the state health insurance commissioner’s office regarding attempts to bolster spending on primary care in Rhode Island. "Between 2007 and 2011, total primary care spending grew by 23 percent (for an annual growth rate of 5.3 percent), while overall medical spending fell by 17.6 percent (-4.7 percent annually)," the report said. The report noted that the figures reflected the money spent by insurers, not by patients. And it attributed the overall decline in medical spending to three factors: "The dampening effect of the recession and slow economic recovery on spending." "The popularity among employers and members of leaner, cheaper benefit packages that shift more costs to the member." "The shift to self-insurance." In an interview, Health Commissioner Christopher F. Koller said, "Senator Miller is factually accurate in that the numbers are from the report, and the total medical spending reported by insurers during that period is true." But then Koller mentioned two key facts: total medical spending is down in large part because it reflects health insurer spending for fewer people. The most recent figures show per-person costs are actually rising. "It’s during a period of economic decline, so more people are uninsured," Koller said. "Also, during that time, we saw an increase in the number of companies that self-insure." And the figures don’t reflect those covered by employers who self-insure, such as Brown University, he said. Between 2007 and 2011, commercial health-insurance enrollment in Rhode Island plunged by 53,509 people or by 8.7 percent -- going from 613,124 to 559,615, according to Koller’s office. And when measured per-member per-month, medical spending rose by 6.8 percent between 2009 and 2011, according to another report by his office. Koller said that 6.8 increase is "relatively low" when compared with the increases seen in other states in that time frame. So, he said, that bolsters Miller’s larger point that Rhode Island is doing a good job of controlling health-care cost increases. Our ruling Sen. Joshua Miller said, "In the period from 2007 to 2011, the Office of Health Insurance Commissioner reported an 18 percent decline in the state’s total medical spending." In touting Rhode Island’s progress in "cost containment," Miller’s accurate but limited citation of a report gives the impression that overall medical costs are falling in Rhode Island. But his news release left out some important context: that spending by insurers has fallen mainly because it reflected spending on fewer people. In fact, in recent years, per-person costs have increased. That full context is required to provide a true picture of how Rhode Island is doing in controlling health-care costs. So we rule Miller’s claim Half True. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at politifact@providencejournal.com. And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)

pomt-04425	"The tax burden on Virginia families was lower under Tim Kaine than under George Allen."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2012/oct/15/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-says-says-tax-burden-families-was-lower-/	The debate never strays too far from taxes in this fall’s U.S. Senate race between Republican George Allen and Democrat Tim Kaine. Allen recently aired a TV commercial accusing Kaine of being a big taxer. The ad highlighted Kaine’s unsuccessful proposals for $4 billion in tax increases when he was governor from 2006 to 2010 and his comment in a Sept. 20 debate that he would be "open" to imposing a minimum federal income tax on all Americans. Kaine responded to the ad. "The facts are that the tax burden on Virginia families was lower under Tim Kaine than under George Allen," his campaign said in a Sept. 25 news release. We wondered if the tax burden on families really was lower under Kaine than under Allen, who was governor from 1994 to 1998. Kaine’s campaign told us they got the numbers from the pro-business Tax Foundation. The organization estimates what residents of each state pay in taxes -- not to just their own state and local governments, but also to others, through hotel, gas and other levies. Take, for example, Northern Virginia residents who work in the Washington. The computations would include state and local taxes the commuters are paying Virginia as well as estimates of sales, restaurant and other levies they pay in Washington. According to the Tax Foundation, Virginians paid state and local taxes averaging 6.9 percent of their income during Allen’s governorship as compared to 6.7 percent during Kaine’s administration. We were uncertain what to make of these numbers because neither Kaine nor Allen could control tax rates outside of Virginia when they were governors. So we turned to data that is confined to computing the state levies Virginians pay, as a proportion of their income, to Virginia. We found two sources: Congressional Quarterly’s annual State Fact Finder; which makes the calculation based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau and Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Economic Analysis; and the Tax Policy Center, whose website allows visitors to build their own tables based on data from the Census Bureau. The annual data from both groups computes total state tax revenues as a percentage of the total income of Virginians. Congressional Quarterly’s figures show that during Allen’s governorship, yearly state tax revenues averaged 5.6 percent of all the income earned by Virginians; over Kaine’s term, the average was 5.3 percent. The Tax Policy Center’s figures show that the average was an identical 5.3 percent during Allen and Kaine’s terms. It should be noted that the center did not have data for the final budget year of Kaine’s term, which began July 1, 2009. We found an interesting trend in the data from both organizations. The tax burden was stable during the years Allen was in office; ranging from 5.5 percent to 5.6 percent according to the Congressional Quarterly, and 5.2 percent to 5.4 percent according to the Tax Policy Center. In contrast, the burden was volatile under Kaine, falling from 5.9 percent during his first year in office to 4.6 percent his final year, according to Congressional Quarterly. According to the Tax Policy Center, the burden dropped from 5.6 percent Kaine’s first year to 4.8 percent his third year -- the latest data available. Economists said the decline, experienced by many states, was caused by the national recession that set in half way through Kaine’s term. "Tax collections shrink faster than income," explained said Scott Drenkard, an economist with the Tax Foundation. Norton Francis, senior research associate with the Tax Policy Center, said Virginia’s tax revenues declined by 10 percent, as corporate income dropped, real estate sales sagged and consumers reined in spending. Virginia did not enact major tax cuts during the final years of Kaine’s term. That leaves the recession as best explanation why the tax burden fell, according to Drenkard. John Knapp, a senior economist and professor emeritus at the University of Virginia’s Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service, said the per capita tax burden is a poor way to measure a governor’s performance. "Many of the events during a term that affect the denominator (income) are beyond the control of a governor," he said. "This also applies to the numerator (taxes) since a lot of factors affect tax collections in addition to explicit changes in tax rates and tax bases. For example, if the economy deteriorates in response to national and international events, income and sales tax collections will reflect the soft economy." The figures don’t reflect another important consideration: Allen unsuccessfully sought to cut taxes by $2.1 billion when he was governor, while Kaine unsuccessfully proposed $4 billion in tax increases. Finally, we should note that under Allen and Kaine, Virginia was among the 10 states with the lowest tax per capita tax burdens. Our ruling Kaine’s campaign said the "tax burden on Virginia families was lower under Tim Kaine than under George Allen." Raw numbers generally back Kaine, but paint a superficial picture. Kaine did not offer large-scale tax cuts during his term; to the contrary, he unsuccessfully proposed increasing taxes by $4 billion. The smaller burden was caused by shrinking tax revenues coming into the state because of the recession. Kaine’s statement tries to turn the state’s lost revenue -- caused by no effort of his own -- into an accomplishment. The claim is based on kernels of data that, when put into context, give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-02198	"The President wants the U.S. to sign on to the U.N.’s International Criminal Court."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/24/chain-email/chain-email-says-barack-obama-wants-us-joint-inter/	A reader recently sent us an email that had a meandering -- but strongly critical -- message of opposition to President Barack Obama. The email, which can be read in its entirety here, urges veterans and their families to vote in the 2014 midterm elections in order to send Obama a message. Here are excerpts: "The President, the Commander in Chief, has made the Rules of Engagement (ROE) so difficult, that our troops are often killed before they can even get permission to fight. Nothing has been done to stop our troops from being murdered by the Afghanis they are training, either. "Now, the President wants the US to sign on to the UNs International Criminal Court (ICC), which would allow the UN's ICC to arrest and try US troops for War Crimes, without the legal protections guaranteed under US Law, and from which there is no appeal. The President, with his Democratic control of the Senate, has nearly all the power. If the Non-Establishment Republicans, and Conservatives, can take back the Senate in 2014, our troops can once again be protected from unnecessary danger. Please consider this, and send it on to your mailing lists." We will be checking a few claims from this email, but in this report, we’ll look at the claim that "the President wants the U.S. to sign on to the U.N.’s International Criminal Court." First, some background on the International Criminal Court and its relationship to the United States. The ICC is a permanent, independent court headquartered in the Hague that investigates and brings to justice individuals who commit war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, according to the Congressional Research Service. Cases may be referred to the ICC either by a member state, the court’s own prosecutor, or the U.N. Security Council. The court only investigates or prosecutes serious crimes by individuals (not organizations or governments), and then, only when national judicial systems are unwilling or unable to handle them. The court’s founding document, known as the Rome Statute, entered into force on July 1, 2002. So far, 122 nations have become members of the court. But while the United States signed the Rome Statute under President Bill Clinton in 2000, it has not moved on to ratification -- the step that would make membership official. This position is intentional. Under President George W. Bush, the United States actually went so far as to "un-sign" the Rome Statute. The reasons included concerns that the court could exercise jurisdiction over U.S. citizens or military officials, as well as a perceived lack of checks and balances on court pursuits. More recently, United States opposition has softened -- within limits. In 2008, the United States decided not to veto a Security Council resolution to refer a case from the Darfur region of Sudan. Then, when Obama took office, it began attending sessions as an "observer" nation in 2009. In January 2010, a Justice Department review found that "informational" support for "particular investigations or prosecutions" would be legal under laws passed under Bush. In theory, the Obama administration could choose to seek Senate ratification. But even if it did, experts say, the administration’s ability to win the 67 votes in the Senate is almost nonexistent, given the extent of lingering concern about U.S. membership in the court. "President Obama has made no indication that he ‘wants the U.S. to sign on to the U.N.’s International Criminal Court,’" said Steven Groves, a senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. "Since everyone knows such a transmittal would be dead on arrival, the likelihood that the president would do so before the end of his term is negligible, if not zero." Steven R. Ratner, a University of Michigan law professor who specializes in international law, agrees, calling the email’s claim "completely wrong." "Although the U.S. is no longer actively opposed to the court's existence and operation, as was the Bush administration, the Obama administration has no intention of submitting the ICC statute to the Senate," Ratner said. In other words, the email is wrong to claim that Obama, "with his Democratic control of the Senate, has nearly all the power." All Obama could theoretically do is ask for Senate support. Even if the Democrats had 67 votes -- which they don’t -- ratification for this particular agreement would be an uphill battle. We should add that the email has some other misleading elements about the court, such as when it says the court can "arrest and try U.S. troops for War Crimes, without the legal protections guaranteed under U.S. Law, and from which there is no appeal." While the ICC can issue "arrest warrants," it cannot enforce them. The ICC "cannot ‘arrest’ anyone -- it has no police power whatsoever," said Georgetown University professor of government and foreign service Anthony Clark Arend. Instead, it has to rely on its member states to do so, and "a state would not want to cooperate with the ICC if it sought arrest based on trumped-up charges," Ratner said. Ratner added that, contrary to the email’s claim about weak legal protections, the ICC procedures are "generally on par with U.S. law, with small exceptions such as trial by judges rather than a jury, and looser rules for admission of evidence." Our ruling The chain email says Obama "wants the U.S. to sign on to the U.N.’s International Criminal Court." While the Obama administration has been more willing to engage with the court than the Bush administration, which was strongly opposed to cooperating, Obama has made no sign that he wants to become a full-blown member of the court. Even if he did, doing so would require 67 votes in the Senate, making it essentially a nonstarter. We rate the claim False.

pomt-01540	Children who witness domestic violence are "twice as likely to commit it themselves."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/16/amy-klobuchar/klobuchar-children-who-witness-domestic-violence-a/	The release of a video showing NFL running back Ray Rice striking his now-wife in an Atlantic City, N.J., casino elevator revived conversations about domestic violence on the Sunday shows. On the Sept. 14, 2014, edition of CNN’s State of the Union, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., shared an anecdote from her time as a prosecutor to illustrate the ills of domestic violence. "We had a poster outside the door so everyone would see it when they came in. It was a picture of a woman beaten up with a Band-Aid over her nose, holding a little baby boy," Klobuchar said. "And the words read, ‘Beat your wife, and it’s your son that goes to jail.’ " "Kids … that have seen it happen," Klobuchar said, are "twice as likely to commit it themselves." Klobuchar concluded that because the NFL puts "out their players as role models," they have "to set a different culture." We were interested in checking Klobuchar’s claim that kids who witness domestic violence are "twice as likely to commit it themselves." 90's kids We want to be clear upfront that witnessing domestic violence means witnessing it in a child’s household -- not watching the TMZ.com Rice video. That said, the "twice as likely" talking point is fairly popular among advocates against domestic abuse, and suffice to say has been around for a while. The domestic violence literature we’ve seen often cited that claim with a 1990 book called "Physical Violence in American Families: Risk Factors and Adaptations to Violence in 8,145 Families." This book compiled the results of the landmark National Family Violence Surveys of 1975 and 1985, which constituted 60-minute face-to-face interviews and 30-minute phone interviews, respectively, with thousands of American families. Based on those interviews, the book’s authors illustrated how a variety of factors influenced the incidence of domestic violence. Most of the book is about gender differences and roles in domestic violence, but the section on the effects on children crunches the surveys’ numbers on whether abusers said they witnessed abuse as children. That produced the "twice as likely" estimate. The experts we talked to told us there hasn’t been any study as definitive or comprehensive since, although other studies have taken stabs at the issue of intergenerational transmission of domestic violence. "We’ve known for such a long time that the biggest risk factor for being abusive against wives and children is witnessing domestic violence at home or being abused," said Jacquelyn Campbell, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing who studies domestic violence. So "people haven’t repeated the research for a while," Campbell said, and "a lot of stuff is old and mostly cross-sectional." What the existing literature says Campbell pointed us to a 2010 study about intimate partner violence -- a subset of domestic violence -- which found that children who witnessed any intimate partner violence were 2.6 times as likely to perpetrate it themselves. Children who witnessed any violence were 1.6 times as likely, according to the study, to become abusers as adults. Klobuchar’s claim, then, has grounds in literature both old and new. There are literally dozens of studies on this issue, though, and different studies tell different stories. A 2000 meta-analysis of 39 different studies on this issue found a "small-to-medium" correlation between witnessing and perpetrating. The studies in that survey, while a couple decades old, ranged from showing a causal relationship between witnessing and perpetrating to showing no relationship at all. That corroborates Klobuchar’s larger point that parents’ domestic violence has negative outcomes for their children, but that’s not the same as these kids being "twice as likely to commit it themselves." Difficulties with measurements Putting numbers on domestic violence is particularly hard, and perhaps even inappropriate, said Ruth Glenn, executive director of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. "I wouldn’t say twice as likely," said Glenn. "So I would say that it is an additional risk factor. I get nervous when we start to assign data, because there’s not enough data to support it. Domestic violence happens in families, and each of those families are individual units." In other words, there’s enough out there to suggest that children who witness domestic violence are more likely to perpetrate it, but saying something as precise as "twice as likely" is difficult. Domestic violence is "hard to measure for various and sundry reasons," said Glenn, from the lack of "good data" on who’s charged and convicted of domestic violence to confidentiality issues with its victims. And even when researchers can get affirmative data, there are methodological concerns. The studies about children who witness domestic violence often surveyed clinical populations -- meaning those with family issues, so a non-representative sample -- and ask respondents to self-report and to retroactively report. Extricating domestic violence from other family issues -- like mental health and substance abuse -- is also difficult, according to the studies Campbell referred us to. Our ruling Klobuchar, arguing that the NFL has a responsibility to hold its "role models" accountable to a "different culture," said that kids who witness domestic violence in their households are "twice as likely to commit it themselves." There are legitimate, peer-reviewed studies that bear Klobuchar’s claim out. But overall, even though there’s a consensus that witnessing domestic violence puts kids at a greater risk for perpetrating it themselves, the precise figures differ. Measuring domestic violence is very difficult for a variety of reasons, and there hasn’t been a recent, comprehensive study. So saying these kids are "twice as likely to commit" domestic violence is a little too precise. We rate Klobuchar’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-01437	On support for the auto bailouts.	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/06/terri-lynn-land/michigan-republican-senate-candidate-now-says-she-/	The federal government bailout of the auto industry was a contentious and frequent debate topic in the 2012 presidential election. But in the 2014 midterms, the issue has largely gone away — except in Michigan, the heart of the American automobile industry, where there’s a heated race for the state’s open U.S. Senate seat. Rep. Gary Peters, D-Mich., has repeatedly trumpeted to voters his support of the 2009 bailout plan for General Motors and Chrysler. Late last month, the Peters campaign claimed to catch their opponent, former Michigan Secretary of State Terri Lynn Land, flip-flopping on her bailout position. "Yesterday, Land tried to rewrite history and claim she supports the auto rescue, but that’s a tough feat when news reports have chronicled her opposition," Peters spokeswoman Haley Morris said in a press release. The flip in question? On Sept. 25, responding to Peters’ comment on the campaign trail that Land opposed the bailout, Land spokeswoman Heather Swift said, "Once again Gary Peters has it wrong: Terri would have supported the auto rescue." Who is right? We decided to review the evidence. First, a quick refresher on the auto bailout: In 2008 during the economic crisis, President George W. Bush announced plans to bail out the auto industry. General Motors and Chrysler Group received $13.4 million in short-term relief in the final days of the Bush administration to keep them afloat until President Barack Obama’s new team could develop a long-term plan. The Ford Motor Company declined government assistance. In 2009, Obama said if Chrysler and GM wanted more federal money, they had to go through bankruptcy. They quickly agreed. GM received $30 million to restructure the company while Chrysler was sold to Italy’s Fiat. In all, the two companies received about $80 billion in loans, according to a 2010 Treasury report. Today, both companies are relatively healthy and touted as success stories, especially compared to where they were in 2008. We didn’t find many comments from Land about the bailout in 2009. The only statement we came across was from February 2009, when Land, then secretary of state, was exploring a gubernatorial bid. "We will have to work with (GM and Chrysler) and see how we can get them back to sustainability," Land said, according to the Grand Rapid Press. She didn’t say how nor whether she supported government financing to do so. Her campaign did not provide any other comments she made at the time. At the Republican National Convention in 2012, Land spoke with the Washington Times, a conservative news outlet, and was asked whether Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney could compete in Michigan despite the fact he "came out hard against the GM bailout" or whether that statement turned out to be a positive for him in Motor City. A video of the conversation was provided to PolitiFact by the Peters campaign. Here’s how Land responded: I’m with (Romney) on that. Because, actually Bill Ford — we live with the autos. Michigan is a very unique state. No state has one industry that’s so prominent and that’s global. It’s not a Michigan industry, it’s global. And what basically happened is Bill Ford went and got a loan. I mean, he did it that way. And so people know that that could have been done. GM has become, they call it General Government basically, it’s become this huge operation with really nobody that has the commitment like Bill Ford has with his family and his legacy of making sure that company is successful. And that’s what it’s kind of become. They call it Government Motors. That’s what they call it. That’s the reality of it. I think that was the position to have and, you know, Ford is doing great. Fast forward to this year: After a candidate forum in May, Land shirked multiple questions about whether she supported the bailout. A local Fox reporter, though, tracked her down and asked her how she would have voted if she was in Congress, and she said, "If I had been there as a U.S. senator, I would have worked to negotiate a deal that looked more like what Ford Company did." Land repeated that idea on a Detroit radio station the next day, saying, "I would have worked with the other senators to come up with a plan that would protect the taxpayers, make sure that jobs were kept here in Michigan, and did a plan more along the lines what Ford did." There’s several takeaways from this all that underscore a distinct change in position on Land's part. First, she says "I’m with (Romney) on that." "That," according to the question, is Romney’s position to come out "hard against the GM bailout." His actual position was a little more nuanced than that (though Land didn’t disagree with the questioner’s characterization). Romney in 2008 penned an op-ed for the New York Times about the state of the auto industry controversially titled (by the Times, not him) "Let Detroit Go Bankrupt." He called for a managed bankruptcy of the auto companies and called for the federal government to "provide guarantees for post-bankruptcy financing and assure car buyers that their warranties are not at risk," and he continued to argue those positions during the 2012 campaign. While GM and Chrysler did go through bankruptcies, they came out of it because of taxpayer financing. Romney’s plan would have required massive amounts of private capital that would have been tough to find during a financial crisis. Swift, the spokeswoman for Land’s campaign, said Land "did not call GM ‘Government Motors,’ she was describing the situation and telling the panel what she heard from others call it." The most literal of readings would find that accurate, but she didn’t dispute it and went on to describe the company negatively as "this huge operation with really nobody that has the commitment like Bill Ford has." This year, she said she would have supported a plan that would "protect the taxpayers" and "more along the lines what Ford did." Both the Romney plan and the Ford model are vastly different than what ultimately made its way through Congress. Ford's plan didn't even require government intervention. Swift also said the "comment (Land) made in 2012 was referring to the process" of deciding which course of action would be best, and was not opposing the bailout; rather, "she favored a different approach in the beginning." We asked for clarification by what Swift meant by "process" but didn’t hear back. It’s a confusing assertion to make since the remark came three years after the bailout took place. The process of deciding the plan of action was already complete, so we don’t understand why she would have been talking about the process. Our ruling Did Land change positions on a rescue package for the auto industry? If there’s any evidence Land supported the bailout until recently, we didn’t find it, and Land’s campaign didn’t provide it. On the campaign trail so far, she has mostly avoided a direct answer to the question. Her campaign recently said she supported it. In 2012, she said she supported Romney’s plan, which would have required private financing — not government money — to get the auto companies out of bankruptcy, and held up Ford, which rejected any government money, as a model. Her comments, read in full, are critical of how things played out. Earlier this year, she said she would have pushed for something "more along the lines what Ford did," which is even further from the auto bailout than what Romney supported. But on Sept. 25, her campaign said she "would have supported the auto rescue." That’s a distinct change of position, so we rate it Full Flop.

pomt-06195	In 1993, Newt Gingrich "first advocated for the individual mandate in health care. And as recently as May of this year, he was still advocating" for it.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/11/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-newt-gingrich-backed-individ/	During a Republican presidential debate on Dec. 10, 2011, in Des Moines, Iowa, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., took aim at one of her rivals, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, for his past support for an individual mandate for health insurance -- the government requirement for individuals to buy health insurance. It’s a central provision at issue in the legal challenges to President Barack Obama’s health care law. In 1993, Bachmann said, Gingrich "first advocated for the individual mandate in health care. And as recently as May of this year, he was still advocating for the individual mandate in health care." Readers asked us to check the claim, so we did. Gingrich appeared on NBC’s Meet the Press on Oct. 3, 1993, at a time when the Clinton administration was trying to pass a health-care overhaul. On the May 15, 2011, edition of Meet the Press, host David Gregory replayed a clip from Gingrich’s 1993 appearance that addressed the individual mandate. "I am for people, individuals -- exactly like automobile insurance -- individuals having health insurance and being required to have health insurance. And I am prepared to vote for a voucher system which will give individuals, on a sliding scale, a government subsidy so we insure that everyone as individuals have health insurance." That seems pretty clear, but we wanted to locate further context to make sure. We couldn’t locate the full transcript, but we did find a partial transcript excerpted in a Washington Times report: Q: Do you support compulsory national health care? A: Not at all. ... (The president's plan) is a monstrosity. I mean, after all the nice speeches, after all the nice testimony, the fact is, when you read the president's plan, it has got to be the most destructively big-government plan ever proposed. … That's how he gets the money -- by coercing change in order to pay for his plan. Without coercion, this plan collapses, and with coercion, it, frankly, is a remarkable bill to be offered to an American nation. Q: Are you for compulsory automobile insurance? A: I would like to see us go much closer to (Texas Republican Sen.) Phil Gramm's model. I would like to see every American have health insurance. I am willing to require that. I'd much rather do it through an individual voucher, much like an earned-income tax credit, rather than do it through an employer mandate that will kill jobs. But that's not the issue here. You can pass a requirement, and you can find a way to give what is actually less than 8 percent of the American people health insurance without having to go to the total overhaul of American health care, turning it all into a giant bureaucratic mess with a centralized board in Washington appointed by politicians. The full context makes Gingrich seem somewhat more flexible about the details, but ultimately he did say, "I would like to see every American have health insurance. I am willing to require that." What about the claim that Gingrich was advocating for the individual mandate as recently as May 2011 -- a point well after virtually all mainstream Republicans had come out against such a requirement? Here, too, the venue was Meet the Press, the May 15, 2011 edition. After Gregory played the 1993 clip, here’s the conversation: Gregory: "What you advocate there is precisely what President Obama did with his health care legislation, is it not?" Ginrgich: "No, it's not precisely what he did. In, in the first place, Obama basically is trying to replace the entire insurance system, creating state exchanges, building a Washington - based model, creating a federal system. I believe all of us -- and this is going to be a big debate -- I believe all of us have a responsibility to help pay for health care . I think the idea that..." Gregory: "You agree with Mitt Romney on this point." Gingrich: "Well, I agree that all of us have a responsibility to pay -- help pay for health care . And, and I think that there are ways to do it that make most libertarians relatively happy. I've said consistently we ought to have some requirement that you either have health insurance or you post a bond...." Gregory: "Mm-hmm." Gingrich: "...or in some way you indicate you’ll be held accountable." Gregory: "But that is the individual mandate, is it not?" Gingrich: "It's a variation on it." Gregory: "OK." Gingrich: "But it's a system …" Gregory: "And so you won't use that issue against Mitt Romney." Gingrich: "No. But it's a system which allows people to have a range of choices which are designed by the economy. But I think setting the precedent -- you know, there are an amazing number of people who think that they ought to be given health care. And, and so a large number of the uninsured earn $75,000 or more a year, don't buy any health insurance because they want to buy a second house or a better car or go on vacation. And then you and I and everybody else ends up picking up for them. I don't think having a free rider system in health is any more appropriate than having a free rider system in any other part of our society." This exchange became so controversial in Republican circles that Gingrich felt the need to personally walk back his comment the following day. "I am completely opposed to the Obamacare mandate on individuals," he said in a video. "I fought it for two and half years at the Center for Health Transformation. You can see all the things we did to stop it at HealthTransformation.net. I am for the repeal of Obamacare and I am against any effort to impose a federal mandate on anyone because it is fundamentally wrong and I believe unconstitutional." We understand Gingrich’s desire to restate his opposition to the individual mandate, given how deeply opposed Republican voters are to the idea. But was what Gingrich said in the 2011 Meet the Press interview really "advocating for the individual mandate in health care," as Bachmann said in the Des Moines debate? Not quite. Gingrich calls it a "variation" on the individual mandate -- the idea that people take responsibility for their health care, either by purchasing health insurance or by posting a bond to pay for any health care they may eventually need. It’s not the first time Gingrich advocated a choice between a mandate and a bond. For instance, in a June 25, 2007, column titled, "Covering the uninsured -- do we want markets or mandates?" Gingrich wrote, "In order to make coverage more accessible, Congress must do more, including passing legislation to … require anyone who earns more than $50,000 a year to purchase health insurance or post a bond." Working out the details of a bond system -- such as how much would need to be set aside and how -- poses challenges. But it’s conceivable that the legal challenges to Obama’s health care law, which are based on the notion that the government cannot compel Americans to buy a commercial product, might be less likely to succeed if the law had offered the bond option. "A bond alternative was part of the Heritage Foundation's plan and was actually originally in Romney's proposal in Massachusetts but was taken out by legislature late in game," said Michael Tanner, a health policy specialist with the libertarian Cato Institute. "It is a modest improvement over a straight mandate since it doesn't require you to buy a specific product, but libertarians like me still found it objectionable." Still, in our view, the fact that Gingrich supported the bond idea in the 2011 Meet the Press interview muddies the waters enough to weaken the argument Bachmann made -- that "as recently as May of this year, he was still advocating for the individual mandate in health care." Our ruling In the 1993 interview, Gingrich advocated for individuals "being required to have health insurance," though he expressed flexibility on the details. That makes the first half of Bachmann’s claim correct. In the 2011 interview, Gingrich said "we ought to have some requirement that you either have health insurance or you post a bond." It’s an exaggeration to say that this equates to advocating for an individual mandate, since he posed it as one of two acceptable options. On balance, we rate Bachmann’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-02248	Obamacare is "costing 2 million jobs."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/apr/13/laura-ingraham/ingraham-obamacare-costing-2-million-jobs/	The Sunday morning TV pundits revived some passionate talking points about the health care law following this week’s resignation of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. Look to the partisan bickering between Democratic strategist James Carville and conservative radio host Laura Ingraham on ABC’s This Week to see what we mean. Carville said Sebelius’ departure doesn’t change the fact that the law is working. "You know what? Y’all said it was gonna collapse. You said no one would sign up. You said it was going to cost part-time jobs -- " "It’s costing 2 million jobs," Ingraham jumped in, attributing the figure to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Carville kept talking: "You said the risk corridors were going to go broke. None of that has happened. Get over it. It’s working. It’s gonna work." PunditFact checks out Carville’s point on risk corridors here. In this fact-check, we focused on Ingraham’s point about a CBO report that analyzed the health care law’s long-term effect on employment. Fact-checkers have heard Obamacare critics misrepresent the report many, many times. When the CBO released this report in February, House Speaker John Boehner and Fox News host Gretchen Carlson jumped out in front with some poor interpretations of this paragraph from CBO: "The reduction in CBO's projections of hours worked represents a decline in the number of full-time-equivalent workers of about 2.0 million in 2017, rising to about 2.5 million in 2024," the nonpartisan research service wrote. At first blush, that may seem to match what Ingraham said about the law "costing 2 million jobs." But the losses CBO projected aren’t exactly full-time jobs, and they aren’t driven by employers laying off employees. Essentially, some workers are expected to voluntarily dial back their hours. Or as the CBO put it: "The estimated reduction stems almost entirely from a net decline in the amount of labor that workers choose to supply, rather than from a net drop in businesses’ demand for labor." It’s an important distinction. CBO estimated that millions of Americans will probably decide they don’t need to work as much because the law makes health insurance more available by offering subsidies for some to obtain insurance and expanding Medicaid eligibility in some states. CBO found the tax penalties imposed on employers that do not provide insurance to their workers and new taxes on labor income would have a smaller effect on the labor market than the Medicaid expansion and exchange subsidies. Just as important, CBO’s 2 million "full-time-equivalent workers" figure is not a dressed-up word for 2 million full-time jobs. CBO did not break down how many full-time jobs would be reduced under the law versus employees simply working fewer hours, dropping a separate part-time job, or leaving the workforce. "Because some people will reduce the amount of hours they work rather than stopping work altogether, the number who will choose to leave employment because of the ACA in 2024 is likely to be substantially less than 2.5 million," the report states. "At the same time, more than 2.5 million people are likely to reduce the amount of labor they choose to supply to some degree because of the ACA, even though many of them will not leave the labor force entirely." None of this is to say the health care law is not affecting the job market. Analysts expect the country’s labor force participation rate to fall over the coming decade, and some people may not like the idea that people would work fewer hours because they can obtain government-subsidized insurance. "Bigger implicit and explicit tax distortions are reducing productive economic activity," Alan Auerbach, an economist at the University of California-Berkeley, told us in February. Lastly, researchers said the law’s biggest effects on employment would happen after 2016, when more provisions have taken effect, so the estimate is not a present-day reflection as Ingraham makes it sound. CBO researchers also note total employment and compensation will increase over the next decade, but "that increase will be smaller than it would have been in the absence of the ACA." Our ruling We are fact-checkers, not fortune-tellers. We’ll steer clear of declaring the health care law a success or failure. For one, it’s simply too soon to tell. It is possible to say, however, whether pundits are accurately summarizing projections from nonpartisan government analysts about the law. And when Ingraham cited CBO for her claim that the law "is costing 2 million jobs," she glazed over a swath of important details. Ingraham’s claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. (Update April 15: Ingraham responded to our ruling on her April 14, radio show, saying: "The economy is affected when fewer people work. This is a real effect on the real American economy. So you can argue about how you interpret the number of jobs lost. You can say that's a good thing. ... Democrats love when people aren't working. ...That does not change the underlying fact that jobs will be lost because of Obamacare. PolitiFact and the Democrats think it's a good idea to add to those terrible (jobs) numbers with more people not working. And you're going to fact-check me? Fact-check this. Fact-check yourself. You are so untethered to reality and the real world for most people. Go finger paint in your free time.")	None	Laura Ingraham	None	None	None	2014-04-13T14:38:10	2014-04-13	['None']
pomt-15264	"The law says ... when a police officer stops you, do whatever he says and then deal with it later."	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/jul/30/harry-houck/former-nypd-detective-sandra-blands-traffic-stop-l/	Dashboard camera footage of the traffic stop of Sandra Bland spurred contentious, if not always accurate, cable news debate about a person’s rights when dealing with law enforcement. Bland, a 28-year-old woman from Chicago, was found dead in her jail cell three days after Texas state trooper Brian Encinia stopped her for failing to signal when changing lanes (she was ultimately charged with resisting arrest). Questions still surround her death, which officials called a suicide. But the video gives Americans a clearer look at the explosive start of the arrest that put her behind bars to begin with. The director of the Texas Department of Public Safety criticized Encinia’s actions, saying that the trooper violated arrest procedure. But some people are also questioning Bland’s behavior, including her refusal to put out her cigarette at Encinia’s request. Don Lemon led a CNN Tonight panel on July 21 about the ordeal with legal analyst Sunny Hostin, liberal pundit Marc Lamont Hill and retired New York Police Department detective Harry Houck. Most of the panel agreed with Hostin’s advice for dealing with law enforcement: Essentially, make the encounter as short as possible by obeying orders and dealing with legal issues or mistreatment later. Lemon then asked Houck to clarify the legal rights that people actually have during a police stop — and that’s where the discussion got murky. Lemon asked if all the attention on this encounter and others around the country "is giving people a false sense of rights that they have, that they really don’t have?" Yes, Houck responded. "People actually think, that I've talked to, saying that, no, if a police officer stopped me for something, I don't think he's stopping me for a right reason, but I don't have to cooperate with the officer. But that is wrong," he said. Houck continued: "The law says, just like you said, Don, that when a police officer stops you, do whatever he says and then deal with it later." Read literally, Houck’s statement seems to give law enforcement a lot of leeway during stops. Are civilians really required to obey their each and every order? The video Before we dive into the legal issues underlying Bland’s arrest, let’s review what the video shows. Encinia pulls Bland over for a failure to signal as she changed lanes. Encinia retrieves Bland’s driver’s license and insurance and heads back to his car. After four and a half minutes, Encinia returns to issue a ticket to Bland. At the window, he asks her if she’s okay. "I’m waiting on you, this is your job," she says. "You seem very irritated," he tells her. "I really am," Bland replies, explaining why she’s unhappy that she was pulled over. Encinia asks if she’s done speaking, then asks her to put out her cigarette. Bland refuses, saying that she’s free to smoke a cigarette in her own car. Encinia then directs her out of the car, calling it a "lawful order." When she doesn’t move, he opens the door and forcibly removes her, pointing a Taser in her direction and threatening to "light her up." After Bland exits the car, Encinia issues a number of orders, including for her to put her phone down, to "come over here," to "stand right here," and to "turn around." The confrontation becomes physical shortly afterwards, before Encinia puts Bland in the back of his squad car. The panelists were divided on the issue of whether Bland escalated the situation by claiming rights she did not have when she refused Encinia’s order to put out her cigarette. Experts we consulted said Bland had the right to act the way she did, but Encinia may have, too. Here’s why. Pleading the Fifth (and the Fourth) Does the law really say you have to do whatever a police officer says during a traffic stop? Literally, no. The Constitution affords a few fundamental rights to everyone stopped or arrested by law enforcement in the United States. The right to refuse a search of one’s person, car or home is guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment, and the right to remain silent is protected by the Fifth. No matter how much information Encinia wanted to get out of Bland, she was not legally obliged to provide it. "You definitely don’t have to answer questions," said Robert Weisberg, a Stanford University law professor who specializes in criminal justice and procedure. So Houck’s statement doesn’t hold up under constitutional scrutiny. When reached for comment, Houck said his comments were being taken too literally, adding he only meant that civilians were obligated to comply with orders "within reason." "Anybody with common sense knows what I said," he said. Houck told PunditFact that he had been focusing primarily on the legality of Encinia’s order for Bland to exit her car, a point he brings up early on in the panel discussion but doesn’t stress throughout. In the interview, he brought up Pennsylvania vs. Mimms, a Supreme Court case from 1977 in which two implicated law enforcement officers were found not to have violated the Fourth Amendment when directing a man to exit his car upon stopping him for a traffic violation. He argued that the precedent established in Mimms applies to Bland’s arrest as well. Reasonable suspicion Houck does have a point that officers have a considerable amount of authority over a person during a traffic stop. In Mimms, after directing a man out of his car, officers noticed a bulge under the man’s jacket. The bulge turned out to be a loaded gun, and the man was then arrested. The court ruled that exiting one’s car for the duration of a stop did not violate a person's Fourth Amendment rights. So Encinia, using Mimms as jurisprudence, had the right to direct Bland out of her car, even if he had no reason to suspect that she was armed or dangerous. Some have argued, however, that because the "legal stop" was finished by the time Encinia directed Bland out the car, he did not have the right to continue the interaction. But the broader point that Houck misses in his explanation is that much of an officer’s authority to search or use force or a person is permissible only if they have reason to suspect that the person is armed or dangerous, or has committed a crime. What exactly constitutes "reasonable suspicion" is still up for for debate. Weisberg emphasized how gray this area of law still is. A non-answer, for example, can often be interpreted by law enforcement as "furtive behavior," thus authorizing many options an officer might not have otherwise had, including searching, moving, or using force on a subject, Weisberg said. Making these judgment calls is where officers have the most leeway, said Jason Williamson, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union who recently wrote a Bland-inspired article for Time entitled "What to Do if You Get Pulled Over by a Cop." "It’s certainly true that cops are given discretion and the benefit of the doubt," Williamson said. In order for Encinia to argue that he was suspicious of Bland, he would have to point to her refusal to put out her cigarette as an indication of violent intentions, said Jody David Armour, a University of Southern California law professor. "That is a judgment of intent," he said, "and a judgment of character." Our ruling Houck claimed that "the law says … that when a police officer stops you, do whatever he says" during a stop. Reasonable suspicion justifies an officer’s increased authority during a stop or an arrest, though the definition of "reasonable" is often unclear. Applied generally, however, the claim is incorrect. Even though it might be advisable to defer to law enforcement in many cases, the Constitution protects one’s right to remain silent and to not consent to a search. Without suspicion that the subject is armed or has committed a crime, an officer must respect these rights. That's what the law says. We rate Houck's claim False. Correction: This item was updated on July 31 to correct the sequence of events in describing Pennsylvania vs. Mimms. In that case, the Supreme Court found that the act of ordering a person out of a car for the duration of a stop, even in the absence of reasonable suspicion, is constitutional.

pomt-09433	The Obama administration "spent more money on the Cash for Clunkers program than the space program."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/mar/12/marco-rubio/rubio-criticizes-space-budget/	NASA's budget has been a hot topic among Florida politicians since the Obama administration's recent announcement that it plans to kill the NASA Constellation program, which sought to put astronauts back on the moon. Republican U.S. Senate candidate Marco Rubio jumped on the bandwagon and spoke against Obama's plan during a meeting of the Brevard County Republican Club in February, according to an article in Florida Today on Feb. 8, 2010: The article said that Rubio "criticized the Obama administration for discontinuing manned space flight in favor of more innovative technological advances, ignoring that Obama also proposed an increase in NASA's budget over the next several years." Rubio was quoted saying, "They spent more money on the Cash for Clunkers program than the space program." That article and another one in Politico that used the same quote, had some context before Rubio's quote about the proposed cuts in the Constellation program. The Florida Today article mentioned Obama's plan to discontinue manned space flight. Politico quoted Rubio's primary opponent, Gov. Charlie Crist, stating: "Unless we continue the Constellation Program that allows America to be a leader in space innovation and provides jobs for many Floridians on the Space Coast, this discussion will leave many of the same problems unresolved." Both articles also noted that overall, Obama proposed an increase in NASA funding. When we asked Rubio's campaign about the quote, spokesman Alberto Martinez told us that Rubio was referring to the Constellation program -- not NASA's overall budget. "Marco has used that line several times, and what he is specifically referring to is President Obama's decision to scrap the Constellation Program," Martinez wrote to us in an e-mail. Before we wade into the question of whether Rubio's context was clear, here's how the numbers compare: * Cash for Clunkers was a $3 billion program, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. * NASA's overall budget this year is $18.7 billion, proposed to rise to $19 billion next year. * NASA's Exploration program, which includes the Constellation initiative, was about $3.8 billion this year. The cost would be $2.5 billion to phase out the Constellation program over two years and then it would drop to zero. So Rubio would be right if the comparison is Constellation ($3 billion for Cash for Clunkers versus $2.5 billion to phase the Constellation effort), but he'd be wrong if it's the NASA space program overall (the $3 billion for Clunkers versus roughly $19 billion for NASA). Now, to the question of Rubio's context. Martinez told us he was referring specifically to Constellation. "The point Marco was making is that this president has shown he is willing to spend more money in programs like 'Cash for Clunkers' than he is willing to spend on pursuing the next phase of a planned manned-space flight program. Marco made his remarks before an audience on the Space Coast which is informed about this issue. They know the only manned space flight program was the Constellation Program." That made us wonder what the audience thought, so we called two Republicans who attended the meeting and asked them what they believed he was referring to. But neither specifically recalled the statement. So to recap: Rubio would be correct if indeed he was suggesting that the U.S. spent more on Cash for Clunkers -- $3 billion -- than the Obama administration would spend on Constellation. But by referring to it as the "space program," his comment was so vague that it sounds more like he's referring to the entire NASA budget. And the Florida Today article helps to back that up by noting that he ignored the fact that Obama was proposing an increase in NASA's overall spending. The Rubio campaign says his context was clear to the audience, but we think his wording most likely is interpreted to mean the entire NASA budget. So we find the claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-10254	(McCain) says "we can't have ... timelines to draw down our troops from Iraq."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/27/joe-biden/mccain-has-often-opposed-timelines-but-not-always/	In his Aug. 27, 2008, speech at the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Sen. Joe Biden characterized Sen. John McCain's position on timelines for withdrawal from Iraq as an unequivocal "no." Here's the full context of Biden's claim: "Should we trust John McCain's judgment when he says — when he says we can't have ... timelines to draw down our troops from Iraq, that we must stay indefinitely?" Biden said. "Or should we listen to Barack Obama, who says shift the responsibility to the Iraqis and set a time to bring our combat troops home? Now, after six long years, the administration and the Iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home. John McCain was wrong, and Barack Obama was right." But does McCain really say "there can be no timelines to draw down our troops from Iraq"? It is true that on many occasions McCain has vociferously opposed the idea of setting a timetable — or a timeline (we believe the words are interchangeable) — for withdrawal from Iraq. During the Republican primary contest, McCain harshly criticized Mitt Romney's use of the term "timetable," saying it was "the buzzword for withdrawal." For days he carried around a note card with Romney's words to remind primary voters of Romney's endorsement of a timetable. However, it is also true that more recently McCain has adjusted his rhetoric. In a July speech, McCain said: "I'm confident we will be able to reduce our forces in Iraq next year and our forces will be out of regular combat operations and dramatically reduced in number during the term of the next president of the United States." And on other more recent occasions, when criticizing timelines, he has been careful to characterize them first. Here's McCain on Aug. 18: "The hard-won gains of our troops hang in the balance. The lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the Middle East could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines." Note the insertion of the word "arbitrary." On other occasions McCain has criticized "artificial" timelines. But that does not mean he is opposed to any timelines at all. Rather, that language implies that if a timeline were not "arbitrary" or "artificial," McCain could support it. Indeed, here's McCain in a CNN interview on July 25, when asked about Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's endorsement of a timetable: "He said it's a pretty good timetable based on conditions on the ground," McCain said. "I think it's a pretty good timetable, as we should — or horizons for withdrawal — but they have to be based on conditions on the ground." That wasn't the clearest statement in the world. So ABC's George Stephanopoulos pressed McCain on the issue on This Week two days later: STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Obama was in London this morning, and he was responding to your comments from yesterday when you said that 16 months might be a pretty good timetable in Iraq. He said, 'We're pleased to see that there's been some convergence around proposals we've been making for a year-and-a-half.' MCCAIN: That's really good. Look, it's not a timetable, as I said. I was asked, how does that sound? Anything sounds good to me, but… STEPHANOPOULOS: But you never used the word before. MCCAIN: … you know, the point is… STEPHANOPOULOS: You made a point of never using… MCCAIN: … I never… STEPHANOPOULOS: … the word before. MCCAIN: Look, I have always said, and I said then, it's the conditions on the ground. If Senator Obama had had his way, we'd have been out last March, and we'd been out in defeat and chaos, and probably had to come back again because of Iranian influence... STEPHANOPOULOS: But it does seem… MCCAIN: But it is a — it is not a date. I want to make it very clear to you, it is not a date. It's conditions on the ground. STEPHANOPOULOS: So, you shouldn't have used the word timetable. MCCAIN: Pardon me? STEPHANOPOULOS: You shouldn't have used the word timetable. MCCAIN: I didn't use the word timetable. That I did — if I did… STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, it's a pretty good timetable. MCCAIN: Oh, well, look. Anything is a good timetable that is dictated by conditions on the ground. Anything is good. But the timetable is dictated, not by an artificial date, but by the conditions on the ground, the conditions of security. McCain clearly was not comfortable embracing the idea of a timetable for withdrawal. But nor was he comfortable opposing it in all cases. His answers in both the CNN and ABC interviews suggest that he could be okay with a timetable if it were dependent on conditions on the ground. Biden did not acknowledge the gray area in McCain's approach to a timeline, instead implying that McCain was unequivocally opposed to any timeline at all. Since McCain has spoken out repeatedly against timelines — but indicated he was open to them on other occasions — we find Biden's claim to be Half True.

pomt-09821	"Scientists project that the Arctic will be ice-free in the summer of 2013."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/02/john-kerry/kerry-claims-arctic-will-be-ice-free-2013/	Sen. John Kerry says climate change is happening faster than we think. In an Aug. 31, 2009, op-ed in the Huffington Post, the Massachusetts Democrat wrote that the threat of climate change "is not an abstract concern for the future." "It is already upon us and its effects are being felt worldwide, right now," he wrote. "Scientists project that the Arctic will be ice-free in the summer of 2013. Not in 2050, but four years from now. Make no mistake: catastrophic climate change represents a threat to human security, global stability, and — yes — even to American national security." We don't debate that the effects of climate change are already being felt. However, Kerry's claim that the Arctic will be ice-free in as little as five years is ominous and worth putting to the Truth-O-Meter. Arctic ice has long been considered a canary in a coal mine for climate scientists; they watch it closely because significant melts indicate an acceleration of climate change effects. In fact, temperatures actually rise faster in icy regions because of something known as ice albedo feedback loop. Ice is more reflective than land or water. When ice melts, the reflectivity of the Earth's surface decreases as well, and more solar radiation is absorbed by the land and the oceans. So, as ice melts, more and more heat from the sun is absorbed, accelerating the warming process. Melting has recently become a more serious problem, and 2007 was a particularly bad year for the Arctic. Then, about 552 billion tons of ice melted from Greenland's ice sheet during the summer — about 15 percent more than the summer average. The summer of 2009 didn't look much better. According to the National Snow and Ice Data Center, the average rate of melt in July of this year is nearly identical to that of July 2007, in part due to unusual weather patterns and an underlying trend toward higher temperatures. But does this mean ice will be completely gone in the next few years? We talked to Julienne Stroeve, a researcher for the NSIDC, for some perspective. Climate scientists "agree that we'll lose summer ice cover," she said. "As to the exact date, it varies between groups." The summer ice cover is what's left of the sea ice after the annual seasonal melting. It refreezes when temperatures drop. Indeed, predictions are all over the map. Kerry got his data from Wieslaw Maslowski, a researcher from the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif., who as early as 2007 predicted the Arctic would be ice-free by the summer of 2013. Similar projections have been trumpeted by a handful of other scientists, including Warwick Vincent, director of the Center for Northern Studies at Laval University in Quebec and NASA climate scientist Jay Zwally. (A Kerry spokeswoman directed us to this 2007 article about Maslowski's work.) Meanwhile, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations group relying on the consensus of hundreds of climate scientists, estimated in 2007 that summer ice would largely be gone in the latter part of the 21st century; and Stroeve said NSIDC supports a prediction of 2030. NASA climate researcher Gavin Schmidt wrote in an e-mail to us that Maslowski's prediction isn't necessarily a communitywide opinion. "A fair statement would be that some scientists have predicted summer ice free Arctic Ocean as soon as 2013, but others expect it to happen a little slower — say 2040-2060," Schmidt wrote. Differences occur when research focuses on the area of the Arctic — based on aerial satellite photographs — or on thickness and volume of the ice as well as area, according to Maslowski. In both cases, scientists have seen melting, Maslowski said. However, when estimates are based on the latter method, as Maslowski and his team of researchers have done, melting seems to be happening much faster. "There is no crystal ball, there is no final prediction, just estimates," Maslowski said. "All we are trying to show is that we better start thinking [ice-free summers] could start earlier than 2100 or 2030. We should be prepared for the worst-case scenario." Kerry's claim also leaves out an important nuance; as Stroeve said, most climate scientists agree that summer ice is likely to disappear at some point, but that the oceans will still freeze in the winter for a very long time. However, Kerry's op-ed could make it sound as if the Arctic will devoid of ice all year long. As always with the climate change debate, we've found that there's a wide range of informed opinion on the issue of Arctic melting. In a general sense, Kerry is correct that Arctic ice is melting at a quickening rate. However, he has based his prediction on the earliest and most extreme estimate, when a much wider range of estimates are available and most project the turning point will occur decades from now. And he makes it seem as if the Arctic will be totally ice-free within a few short years when in fact that would only be true for the summer. As a result, we rate Kerry's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-13600	"Because there's no local option to allow communities to ban, limit or restrict the location of pot shops, if Amendment 2 passes you can expect the seedy elements of the pot industry to move in right next door to your neighborhood, your church, your business and even your child's school."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2016/aug/16/vote-no-2/medical-marijuana-amendment-doesnt-restrict-dispen/	Local governments will be powerless to prevent medical marijuana dispensaries from sprouting up anywhere and everywhere should Amendment 2 pass this fall, opponents of the measure say. A pamphlet from Vote No On 2 mailed to voters in July warns that the constitutional amendment prevents any kinds of restrictions on the locations of marijuana-related businesses. The amendment would allow doctors to recommend medical marijuana for certain health conditions and patients to pick up the drug from dispensaries that sell it. "Because there's no local option to allow communities to ban, limit or restrict the location of pot shops, if Amendment 2 passes you can expect the seedy elements of the pot industry to move in right next door to your neighborhood, your church, your business and even your child's school," the pamphlet cautions. Vote No On 2 is a campaign run by the Drug Free Florida Committee, an anti-drug group started in 2014 by longtime GOP fundraiser Mel Sembler and his wife, Betty, with financial backing from casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. We wanted to know whether Amendment 2 prevented communities from their own bans on so-called "pot shops." The short answer is that the amendment does not have any provisions for local legislation — but that’s only because the state would eventually be deciding whether local jurisdictions could do that. Amendment 2 redux First, let’s recall that Amendment 2 hit the ballot first in 2014, but just missed the 60 percent of the vote needed to pass. The current version for the November 2016 ballot has the same name, but United for Care, the group behind the measure, has altered the language for November 2016 to clear up confusion about the prior proposal. The amendment now requires parental consent and doctor certification for minors and more clearly defines the medical conditions it covers: cancer, HIV/AIDS, epilepsy, glaucoma, post-traumatic stress disorder, Crohn’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis "or other debilitating medical conditions of the same kind or class as or comparable to those enumerated," with a doctor’s recommendation. That means that if a doctor recommends medical marijuana for a patient with one of these conditions, the patient (or a certified caregiver) will get a state-issued ID card. That card allows them to buy marijuana at a state-regulated dispensary. There are some things to keep in mind about the whole process. Doctors are only recommending cannabis, because it’s illegal under federal law to prescribe a Schedule I drug — meaning it’s considered highly addictive and has no known medical benefits. Doctors would risk losing their ability to practice medicine if they prescribe marijuana. Pharmacies also can’t legally distribute cannabis, making dispensaries necessary. Dispensary suspense The state has estimated there could be almost 2,000 medical marijuana dispensaries in Florida should Amendment 2 pass, though there may be far fewer than that in reality. The proposed amendment requires the Legislature and the health department to figure out all the details of implementing medical marijuana should the measure pass — including the number of dispensaries and where they’re allowed to be. Vote No on 2 spokeswoman Christina Johnson pointed out to us that Amendment 2 does not include any language about a local option, and therefore doesn’t guarantee the state will allow them. The group believes that if a community passes an ordinance, the issue will have to be settled in court due to the amendment’s wording, and a right to access will trump local law. But the amendment also doesn’t prevent the state from letting local jurisdictions create their own rules. While no one knows exactly what will happen, chances are good that there will be some leeway for local rules. Kate Bell, legislative counsel for the Marijuana Policy Project, said it wouldn’t be appropriate for an amendment to try to codify regulations into the state’s constitution. Instead, regulations would have to spell out specifics, such as setbacks from schools and how dispensaries must follow local zoning laws. If the state doesn’t make distinct rules about dispensaries, local zoning rules would likely apply. The examples from other laws vary, as all 25 medical marijuana states (plus the District of Columbia) differ in their regulations. In New York, a rule says dispensaries can’t be within 1,000 feet of a "school, church, synagogue or other place of worship." In Washington, D.C., a dense urban area, dispensaries and cultivation centers where marijuana is grown may be no closer than 300 feet of a "preschool, primary or secondary school, or recreation center." Ordinances could be shaped into de facto bans, but there is some precedent for local governments being prevented from prohibiting dispensaries entirely. Maryland regulations say a licensed dispensary "shall conform to all local zoning and planning requirements," but the state’s attorney general has said in an opinion that those rules can’t outright ban dispensaries. Arizona law says "cities, towns and counties may enact reasonable zoning regulations that limit the use of land for registered nonprofit medical marijuana dispensaries to specified areas," but court rulings have said those laws can’t make opening a dispensary practically impossible. Pennsylvania’s law, passed earlier this year, prevented local ordinances from completely banning dispensaries. Andrew Livingston, a policy analyst for national law firm Vicente Sederberg, which represents marijuana businesses, said Florida is fairly unique in trying to pass a constitutional amendment with the expectation of marijuana storefronts. Nevada and Colorado passed constitutional amendments, and both allow local dispensary bans. He said almost all states that used voter-approved initiatives — like California, Oregon and Alaska — made the decision before the idea of dispensaries became popular. Those states focused on allowing patients or caregiver to grow their own plants, not buy them through state-approved dispensaries. "There were no reasons to ban marijuana businesses because marijuana businesses were never mentioned in these earliest laws," Livingston said. There is no provision in the Florida amendment for patients to grow their own plants. As for Florida, we don’t have to wait to see whether towns or counties will create their own laws shunning medical marijuana. It’s already happening, in part because of a 2014 law allowing low-THC cannabis products for patients with muscle spasms, cancer, epilepsy and terminal illnesses. More than two dozen cities have regulated or completely banned medical marijuana sales. Boca Raton, for example, has a moratorium on medical marijuana dispensaries, cultivation, processing or distribution until city zoning rules are ironed out. Pasco County has banned any type of marijuana business. And while cannabis is still illegal in Plant City, the city commission passed an ordinance on Aug. 8 in anticipation of Amendment 2 winning at the polls. If federal law one day changes, medical marijuana dispensaries would be allowed, but they still have to be at least 500 feet from schools, churches, daycares, drug treatment centers, public parks and residential areas. Any dispensaries also would be confined to an area smaller than four acres in the city, next to a hospital and a fried chicken restaurant. Our ruling Vote No On 2 said, "Because there's no local option to allow communities to ban, limit or restrict the location of pot shops, if Amendment 2 passes you can expect the seedy elements of the pot industry to move in right next door to your neighborhood, your church, your business and even your child's school." While the statement is technically accurate about the amendment’s wording, it’s highly doubtful there will be a dispensary on every corner. If it passes, the state will be in charge of writing regulations, including whether and how local jurisdictions will be able to create their own zoning laws or ordinances. It’s impossible to say with certainty what Florida’s regulations on dispensaries would look like should the amendment pass, as regulations in other medical marijuana states vary. But local bans or restrictive laws on dispensaries are common in medical marijuana states. Fears about the precise locations of pot shops and local control are premature. We rate the statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f4413312-de1e-4cdc-82c4-14c5503bfc39	None	Vote No On 2	None	None	None	2016-08-16T16:38:20	2016-07-20	['None']
pomt-04484	Says under U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez’s watch the nation’s unemployment rate and debt doubled and the federal budget deficit quadrupled.	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/oct/07/joseph-kyrillos/joe-kyrillos-pins-blame-robert-menendez-rising-nat/	Republican Senate hopeful Joe Kyrillos started his pitch for the votes of New Jersey residents in November by tying national economic woes to his Democratic rival. In his opening remarks in a debate with Democratic incumbent U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez that aired on NJTV Thursday night, Kyrillos said the "American dream is in peril" and "we need to make a change." "Now if you think things are just fine, that things are okay here in New Jersey and across the land, well then you’ll choose my opponent again. But if you think that unemployment doubling — doubling — under his watch, the deficits quadrupling, our national debt doubling is unacceptable, then you’re going to make a change and you’ll choose me," said Kyrillos, a state senator from Monmouth County. Kyrillos, for the most part, accurately reflected the economic trends since Menendez took office as a U.S. Senator in January 2006. But Kyrillos runs into trouble because as one expert said it’s "beyond ridiculous" to pin those increases on one senator. Here’s how the three numbers -- unemployment, debt and deficit -- break down. The unemployment rate stood at 4.7 percent in January 2006, according to federal labor data. It climbed to a peak of 10 percent in October of 2009, but when Kyrillos made his statement the latest numbers showed the jobless rate was 8.1 percent. That’s less than double the 2006 rate. The unemployment rate dropped in September to 7.8 percent, according to data released Friday morning. As for the growth in the national debt and deficit, since 2006 the former nearly doubled and the latter quadrupled. The gross national debt includes money the government borrowed from outside investors and foreign countries, as well as money loaned from one governmental pocket, like the Social Security Trust fund to another, like the general fund. The gross debt was about $16.16 trillion on Thursday, up from $8.17 trillion on Jan. 18, 2006, the day Menendez was sworn into the U.S. Senate. That’s according to data from the U.S. Treasury Department. According to the Office of Management and Budget, the budget for fiscal year 2006 had a nearly $250 billion deficit, which is the difference between incoming revenue and outgoing expenses in a year. In 2009, the deficit hit a peak of about $1.4 trillion. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office expects the fiscal year 2012 budget deficit to be about $1.1 trillion, more than quadruple the deficit in 2006. But how much, if at all, is Menendez responsible for those increases? "Placing responsibility for national economic developments on an individual Senator is beyond ridiculous," Alan Auerbach, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, said in an e-mail. We have addressed similar issues in previous fact-checks, noting that governors, presidents and legislators aren’t the sole catalyst behind broad economic trends. In his campaign kickoff speech in February, Kyrillos blamed Menendez for increased deficits during his tenure in the Senate. We noted in that fact-check that Menendez voted for some measures -- like the stimulus program -- that fueled more spending in 2009. But federal budget experts cited the recession as a major factor behind increased deficits, so Kyrillos’ statement was rated Half True. The same problems apply to Kyrillos’ statement in the debate. The numbers are mostly on target, but the recession played a critical role in driving up government costs and driving down employment. Menendez's campaign manager Mike Soliman called Kyrillos' statement "hypocritical" because of his support for policies, like the tax cuts passed by President George W. Bush, that contributed to the debt. Kyrillos’ campaign manager, Chapin Fay, stuck with the same refrain, saying in a statement, "Fact is, we are worse off since Bob Menendez took office." Our ruling Kyrillos said that under Menendez’s watch the nation’s unemployment rate and debt doubled and the federal budget deficit quadrupled. While Kyrillos’s arithmetic is mostly accurate in the time since Menendez joined the Senate, it’s wrong to assign full responsibility for national economic trends on one legislator. For that reason, we rate this claim Half True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.	None	Joseph Kyrillos	None	None	None	2012-10-07T07:30:00	2012-10-04	['United_States']
pomt-01031	"Documents released from the Soviet Union" show "the Soviet Union started treating" President Ronald Reagan more seriously after Reagan fired the air traffic controllers.	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jan/28/scott-walker/scott-walker-records-show-soviets-treated-ronald-r/	As momentum builds for a possible 2016 presidential run, Gov. Scott Walker has spent more time speaking on foreign policy. One of his talking points: Leadership trumps experience when it comes to managing affairs overseas. Look at Ronald Reagan. That was Walker’s response Jan. 21, 2015 when he was asked on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" about the importance of foreign policy experience. First, the governor criticized the secretary of state record of Hillary Clinton, the leading potential Democratic candidate for 2016. Then he turned to Reagan, one of his political heroes, and one of the Republican president’s early acts in office -- the mass firing of most of the nation’s air traffic controllers. In August 1981, after contract talks between the federal government and the union for the controllers stalled, nearly 13,000 controllers walked off the job. Just seven months into his first term, Reagan called the strike illegal and demanded they return to work. When more than 11,000 didn't, Reagan fired them in what was an unprecedented action. In his MSNBC interview, Walker asserted that the move was one of the most important foreign policy decisions "made in our lifetime," showing allies and adversaries around the world "that we were serious." Then he added this: "Years later, documents released from the Soviet Union showed that that exactly was the case. The Soviet Union started treating (Reagan) more seriously once he did something like that. Ideas have to have consequences. And I think (President Barack Obama) has failed mainly because he's made threats and hasn't followed through on them." So, Walker goes beyond stating an opinion about the foreign policy implications of Reagan’s move. He states as fact that there are Soviet documents showing the Soviets treated the Reagan more seriously because he fired American air traffic controllers. That’s a bold claim. Walker's evidence When we asked for evidence to back the claim, both the governor's office and Walker's campaign cited statements from a variety of people. Each essentially said the firings showed Reagan meant what he said, and that he was to be taken seriously. Some examples: Reagan special assistant Peggy Noonan wrote in her White House memoir that George Shultz, who became Reagan's secretary state a year after the firings, had called the firings the most important foreign policy decision Reagan ever made. Joseph McCartin, the author of a book on the strike, wrote that when House Speaker Tip O’Neill, a Democrat, visited Moscow not long after the strike, "he learned that the Soviet leaders had been deeply impressed by Reagan’s actions." And Reagan biographer Edmund Morris wrote: "Former Soviet apparatchiks will tell you that it was not his famous 'evil empire' speech in 1983 that convinced them he meant strategic business, so much as photographs of the leader of the air traffic controllers union being taken to jail in 1981." Those are perceptions of Americans, however. Walker's claim was the Soviets treated Reagan more seriously after he fired the controllers, and that Soviet documents prove it. But he did not provide us anything referencing Soviet documents. And apparently there are no such documents that have been made public. Experts Five experts told us they had never heard of such documents. Several were incredulous at the notion. McCartin, a Georgetown University labor history expert who wrote the book about the strike that Walker cited, said: "I am not aware of any such documents. If they did exist, I would love to see them." Svetlana Savranskaya, director of Russia programs at the National Security Archive at George Washington University, told us she "had to listen to the Walker interview twice, so ridiculous is the statement about the air traffic controllers. There is absolutely no evidence of this. I would love to see the released Soviet documents on this subject that he has apparently seen." James Graham Wilson, a historian at the U.S. State Department, also told us he was not aware of any Soviet documents showing Moscow’s internal response to the controller firings. He speculated that there could be such records, given how some Soviet experts characterized the firings. Wilson and other authors have noted the perspective of Richard Pipes, professor emeritus of Russian studies at Harvard University. Pipes said the firings showed the Soviets that Reagan was "a man who, when aroused, will go to the limit to back up his principles." But even as the firings gained the attention of the Soviets, there were other U.S.-Soviet matters during 1981 that were also important. With his first budget, Reagan added $26 billion in defense spending, accelerating the placement of new tanks and warplanes, and he embarked on a modernization of the nation’s nuclear weapons. Reagan also wrote to Soviet leaders imploring them to alleviate Cold War tensions and negotiate arms reductions. In any case, the lack of Soviet records described by Walker is clear. Reagan's own ambassador to the Soviet Union, Jack Matlock, told us: "It's utter nonsense. There is no evidence of that whatever." Matlock questioned whether Soviet leaders even paid much attention to the firings, saying: "At that point, their big question was whether (Reagan) was going to attack them." Our rating Touching on foreign policy issues, Walker said: "Documents released from the Soviet Union" show "the Soviet Union started treating" Ronald Reagan more seriously after Reagan fired the air traffic controllers. There is a view, echoed by Walker, that the firings caught the Soviets’ attention. But Walker cited no Soviet documents showing that the firings made the Soviets treat Reagan more seriously. And experts, several of whom felt Walker’s claim is outrageous, told us they are not aware that any such documents exist. For a statement that is false and ridiculous, our rating is Pants on Fire. ------ More on Scott Walker For profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Scott Walker page.

pomt-00468	"Hospitals are closing in rural America because they don't have access to high-speed internet."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/aug/15/marsha-blackburn/blackburn-broadband-lack-closed-rural-hospitals-it/	At a gathering of the Tennessee Farm Bureau in Franklin, Tenn., Republican Senate nominee Rep. Marsha Blackburn, talked about things she would aim to reduce, such as EPA regulations, and things she would aim to build up, such as broadband internet. Blackburn said fast internet was important for education, and health care. "Hospitals are closing in rural America because they don't have access to high-speed internet," she said Aug. 8. We decided to see if lack of broadband was as pivotal to rural hospitals as Blackburn said. Key takeaways Nationwide, 87 rural hospitals have closed or stopped providing in-patient care since 2010. The leading reasons these hospitals close include: 1. They serve older, poorer, and sicker communities where higher percentages of patients are covered through public insurance programs; 2. They have too few patients to support the size of the facility; 3. Medicaid and Medicare reimbursements often don’t cover their costs. Access to high-speed internet would help, but researchers were unable to identify a hospital that closed due to lack of access. Why hospitals close The Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill tracks rural hospital closures. The center’s director and senior researcher told the Senate Finance Committee in May that the causes are complicated, but they did see some patterns. "Most closures and abandoned rural hospitals are in the South – 60 percent – where poverty rates are higher and people are generally less healthy and less likely to have health insurance, private or public," they said. They said in 2016, the average urban hospital had double the profit margin of the typical rural facility, about 5 percent compared to a bit over 2 percent. A profit margin that slender put hospitals at risk. Their testimony made no mention of high-speed internet. Shep Center research associate Kristie Thompson told us that "we have not identified broadband or any other single cause for the rural hospital closures." It’s not that broadband access wouldn’t help. It would. "Without it, a hospital can’t perform to its potential," said Maggie Elehwany, vice president for policy at the National Rural Health Association. "High-speed internet is definitely a factor in keeping a hospital in good condition. But you can’t say that the lack of it forced a hospital to close." The trade group NTCA-Rural Broadband Association estimated that telemedicine through better broadband could boost the bottom line of the average rural hospital in Tennessee by about $150,000 a year. That is a relatively modest amount. We looked at the eight rural hospitals that have closed in Tennessee since 2010. No press release or news article mentioned the lack of high-speed internet as a driving factor. More common was a declining demand or advances in treatment that left the centers unable to compete. And some reports mentioned federal Medicaid and Medicare payments. Elehwany told us a major issue is a slide in government reimbursements. She said after a wave of rural hospitals shut their doors in the 1980s and 1990s, Congress designated these facilities as critical access hospitals, or other types of rural facilities, and paid them more generously under Medicare. Some states used that designation to boost Medicaid payments as well. "Now, there’s been an erosion of payments to rural hospitals," Elehwany said. "Sequestration was particularly damaging." In an article in the Journal of Health Affairs, public health researchers at the University of Colorado reported that the Affordable Care Act appeared to play a role in rural hospital closure rates. States that expanded Medicaid saw the number of hospitals closing decrease drop steadily after 2014, while states that didn’t saw their closures first decline, and then rise. Overall, researchers said that Medicaid expansion was good for the hospitals’ bottom line. Tennessee did not expand Medicaid. Shep Center researchers said it is an open question whether Medicaid expansion alone lies behind these trends, but they noted that the disproportionate share of closures in the South overlaps with the states that were least likely to expand Medicaid. Abbi Sigler, spokeswoman for the Blackburn campaign told us that lack of access limits hospitals' ability to provide care. " If we don’t improve high speed internet access to rural hospital providers, they will continue to close at alarming rates," Sigler said. She gave no example of a hospital that closed because it didn't have high-speed internet. Our ruling Blackburn said that rural hospitals are closing because they don’t have access to high-speed internet. We could find no research to back that up. The country’s leading center for tracking rural hospital closures said it did not know of a case where lack of broadband caused a hospital to close. A broadband trade group estimated that better internet would help the typical rural hospital in Tennessee by about $150,000 a year.

pomt-08925	Shirley Sherrod "was forced to resign before anybody on Fox said a word about this."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/26/stephen-hayes/stephen-hayes-defends-fox-handling-sherrod-story/	Washington and the nation were captivated a week ago by the controversy over Shirley Sherrod, a once-obscure U.S. Agriculture Department official who became a villain, and then a victim, over the course of 24 hours. Because the story began and ended so quickly, we were unable to fact-check it at the time, but here's a recap of what happened. Andrew Breitbart, a conservative provocateur, started things off July 19, 2010, when he posted a video on one of his websites, BigGovernment.com, that seemed to show Sherrod, who is black, telling an NAACP audience that she had discriminated against a white farmer. After conservative bloggers raised an outcry about Sherrod's apparent revelation, the NAACP moved to condemn Sherrod, and senior Agriculture Department officials quickly pressured Sherrod to resign. But within hours, it came out that the video had been selectively edited, and the uncut version made clear that Sherrod had actually been telling the story about the white farmer to explain how she had overcome her own prejudices. She ended up helping save the family's farm, and the farmer and his wife took to the airwaves to defend Sherrod. The Agriculture Department then reversed itself, with Secretary Tom Vilsack making a heartfelt apology and asking Sherrod to return to the department. Sherrod also received a personal call from President Barack Obama. This whirlwind of charges and counter-charges prompted a round of soul-searching by most of those involved in the episode, including those in government, advocacy groups, the blogosphere and the media. One question that quickly emerged was how culpable Fox News was. In the past, Fox news commentators have often beaten the drum on stories critical of Democrats, liberals and the Obama Administration, so to some who were sympathetic to Sherrod, Fox seemed like a plausible villain. They took as evidence a July 20, 2010, CNN interview with Sherrod, in which she explained how, while driving through Georgia, she was forced out by Cheryl Cook, the deputy undersecretary. When Cook called her cell phone, Sherrod recalled telling Cook, "'Cheryl, I've got a three-and-a-half-hour ride to get into Athens.' She called me a second time, (saying,) 'Where are you now?' I said, 'I'm just going through Atlanta.' She called me again and I said, 'I'm at least 45 minutes to an hour from Athens. She said, 'Well, Shirley, they want you to pull over to the side of the road and do it (formally resign), because you're going to be on Glenn Beck tonight.'" Beck, of course, is an outspoken conservative commentator with popular talk show on Fox. The question of Fox's role came up during the July 25, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week. Host Jake Tapper cited a commentary by Josh Marshall of the liberal website Talking Points Memo. "Breitbart got a piece of video he knew nothing about and published it with a central claim that he either made up or made no attempt to verify," Tapper quoted Marshall as writing. "To use terminology of infectious disease, Fox was the primary vector of this story. And to the best of my knowledge, there's been not only no disciplining of anyone in the newsroom, but as far as I can see, no retraction, apology, or even discussion of their primary role in an obvious smear. This is a journalistic felony, really, the worst kind of thing that journalists can ever do, a reality only compounded by the fact that they refuse to admit not only culpability but even that they did anything wrong." For a reaction, Tapper turned to Stephen Hayes, a senior writer with the Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine, who was a member of the show's roundtable that week. "Stephen, do you think that ... liberals are unfairly using this to try to discredit conservative journalists?" Hayes responded, "Yes, of course, they are. Look, the timeline doesn't work. I mean ... Howard Kurtz, at CNN and the Washington Post wrote that the timeline simply doesn't work. She actually resigned before or was forced to retire before anybody on Fox said a word about this." We thought it would be worthwhile to check the transcripts and see whether it's correct that Sherrod "actually resigned before or was forced to retire before anybody on Fox said a word about this." The earliest on-air comment we could find came the toward the end of the 8 p.m. hour, during an airing of The O'Reilly Factor, a talk show hosted by pugnaciously conservative host Bill O'Reilly. O'Reilly told viewers that "speaking at an NAACP event in March, Department of Agriculture official Shirley Sherrod was caught on tape saying something very disturbing. Seems a white farmer in Georgia had requested government assistance from Ms. Sherrod." He then showed a clip of Sherrod saying, "I was struggling with the fact that so many black people had lost their farmland. And here I was faced with having to help a white person save their land. So I didn't give him the full force of what I could do." When the clip ended, O'Reilly said, "Wow. Well, that is simply unacceptable. And Ms. Sherrod must resign immediately. The federal government cannot have skin color deciding any assistance. We are requesting an explanation from the agriculture secretary, Tom Vilsack, and will keep you posted. By the way, the full transcript of Ms. Sherrod's remarks is posted on BigGovernment.com." While it's safe to assume that O'Reilly was unaware of Sherrod's ouster at the time he aired those comments -- why would he call for her ouster if it had already happened? -- his producers apparently found out as the segment was underway, because as O'Reilly was speaking, Fox aired an on-screen notice that said, "Sec. Vilsack has accepted Sherrod's resignation." A few minutes later, during the 9 p.m. hour of Fox, O'Reilly's fellow conservative host, Sean Hannity, began his show with an alert that Sherrod had resigned. So, based on the Fox transcripts as well as Sherrod's own account in the CNN interview, Hayes appears to be correct that Sherrod "was forced to resign before anybody on Fox said a word about this." Indeed, Howard Kurtz, the Washington Post's media critic, reported that "after a news meeting Monday afternoon (July 19), an e-mail directive was sent to the news staff in which Fox Senior Vice President Michael Clemente said, 'Let's take our time and get the facts straight on this story. Can we get confirmation and comments from Sherrod before going on-air. Let's make sure we do this right.'" But we think it's worth mentioning two additional points. First, it's clear from O'Reilly's on-air comment that at least one Fox commentator was preparing to make hay over the Sherrod controversy before she resigned -- it's just that the Agriculture Department beat Fox to the punch by ousting her first. If officials above Sherrod had spent more time reviewing her case instead of forcing her to the side of the road, O'Reilly at least, and possibly other Fox hosts, were ready to take up the call for her to be ousted. Second, Fox's television network may not have discussed Sherrod before she was ousted, but there's evidence that two of its web affiliates did mention the story. Media Matters for America -- a liberal group that tracks alleged media bias and regularly spars with both Fox and Breitbart -- located a FoxNews.com story posted around noon on July 19 that began, "Days after the NAACP clashed with Tea Party members over allegations of racism, a video has surfaced showing an Agriculture Department official regaling an NAACP audience with a story about how she withheld help to a white farmer facing bankruptcy." Media Matters wrote that FoxNews.com credited BigGovernment.com with posting the video, and added that "FoxNews.com is seeking a response from both the NAACP and the USDA." While Media Matters said that the article is no longer available on FoxNews.com, it provided a screenshot. Not long after that post went up at FoxNews.com, Media Matters said, Fox Nation -- an online community for news and commentary that's affiliated with Fox News -- posted the link to the Sherrod clip on BigGovernment.com under the headline, "Caught on Tape: Obama Official Discriminates Against White Farmer." All told, it seems clear to us that the USDA ousted Sherrod in order to forestall the possibility that commentators on Fox's cable channel would start calling for her resignation, not because Fox commentators had actually begun to do so. Still, two Fox web affiliates mentioned the controversy before Sherrod's ouster, and the fact that O'Reilly called for her resignation without knowing that she was already out of a job suggests that Fox was already beginning to pounce. On balance, these two caveats persuade us to drop Hayes' otherwise accurate statement that Shirley Sherrod "was forced to resign before anybody on Fox said a word about this" by a notch to Mostly True.

pomt-13550	Says Ron Johnson "voted five times for tax breaks that help companies ship Wisconsin jobs overseas."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/aug/26/russ-feingold/feingold-johnson-voted-five-times-tax-breaks-help-/	In the race for the U.S. Senate, a new TV ad from challenger Russ Feingold claims that U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, the Republican incumbent, "voted five times for tax breaks that help companies ship Wisconsin jobs overseas." When it comes to attacks on Republican officeholders, this claim is not new. In 2014, PolitiFact National wrote: "Democrats and their advocates have washed, rinsed and are now repeating one of their favorite talking points from 2012: that ‘(Insert Republican Here) supports tax breaks for corporations that ship jobs overseas.’ " The piece called the description "so simplistic as to be misleading," adding there is no specific tax break for sending jobs to other countries. OK, 2012 … 2014 … 2016 … we’re sensing a trend here. Let’s take a look at how Feingold’s claim fares on the Truth-O-Meter. Bring Jobs Home Act The Feingold campaign cited five votes by Johnson, two of which were on what was termed the Bring Jobs Home Act, which would have given companies credit for bringing jobs to the United States and denied existing deductions associated with moving a business outside the country. Those two votes were specifically addressed in a 2014 factcheck involving a claim against U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky. The claim in the 2014 piece was that McConnell voted "three times for corporate tax breaks that send Kentucky jobs overseas." Feingold’s campaign emphasized that the claim in their ad was that Johnson voted five times for tax breaks that help companies ship jobs overseas, not that corporate tax breaks by themselves are responsible for sending jobs outside the U.S. "Like that PolitiFact notes, McConnell voted against denying deductions for costs associated with outsourcing," Feingold spokesman Michael Tyler said in an email to PolitiFact. "That helps a company attempting to ship its jobs elsewhere." But the earlier item noted: "The tax breaks that the law would have stopped are actually standard business expense deductions. Companies can write off many business-related expenses as tax-deductible -- including relocation. But this isn’t a special provision just for businesses that move outside of the United States. A business would get the same deductions for money spent moving from New York to California." Tax experts said there is very little money associated with these standard deductions and "getting rid of deductions for business expenses associated with outsourcing would not be nearly enough to affect a company’s decision to engage in foreign activity." The legislation was proposed in 2012 and 2014 and Johnson voted "no" on procedural measures in each case, functionally voting to block the legislation from moving forward. The measures failed on procedural votes. The legislation itself was "almost entirely symbolic," PolitiFact reported. Three votes on budget amendments Now let’s turn to the other three votes, taken in March 2015 and cited by the Feingold campaign, this time on amendments to Congress’ concurrent budget resolution for fiscal year 2016. Two were proposed by Democrats and a third was proposed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an Independent who ran as a Democrat in the 2016 presidential race. The amendments were opposed by Republicans, with the two Independents voting with the Democrats. -- Amendment 817 statement of purpose: "To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund to provide tax benefits to patriot employers that invest in American jobs and provide fair pay and benefits to workers and to eliminate tax benefits for corporations that ship jobs overseas." -- Amendment 523 statement of purpose: "To prevent United States companies from getting tax benefits for moving jobs overseas, to end offshore tax loopholes including inversions, and to provide incentives for United States companies to relocate overseas jobs to the United States." -- Amendment 323 statement of purpose: "To create millions of middle class jobs by investing in our nation's infrastructure paid for by raising revenue through closing loopholes in the corporate and international tax system." USA TODAY reported that amendment 323 targets "tax loopholes" that "let corporations and wealthy Americans shift jobs and profits overseas." But experts we spoke with said these votes had no practical effect. Congress’ concurrent budget resolution does not have the force of law and it would not be the place to change the tax code, said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. "To me those are just sort of messaging -- they were all very much of a partisan vote," Ellis said. He added: "You can argue, well, he voted against whatever the message that the member, the Senator, was trying to get across, but I wouldn't necessarily say that was voting for tax breaks that help companies ship Wisconsin jobs overseas because if he had voted for it, it wouldn’t have had any effect and voting against it didn’t have any effect." In addition, he said, tax reform would have to originate in the House, and it would be dealt with by the Senate Committee on Finance and the House Committee on Ways and Means -- not on the floor of the Senate in a budget resolution. In an email, Johnson’s campaign said the senator’s position is that "we should scrap the tax code, rather than favor any single deduction." Our rating Feingold’s campaign ad said Johnson "voted five times for tax breaks that help companies ship Wisconsin jobs overseas." By voting against the Bring Jobs Home Act, Feingold is correct that Johnson voted against denying deductions associated with moving a business out of the country. But, as the 2014 PolitiFact notes, the law was mostly symbolic and these aren’t deductions specifically for moving jobs elsewhere, which is how the statement could easily be interpreted. The amendments to the budget resolution on which he voted had no practical effect, experts told us. We rate this claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8071a5a8-716d-4d13-89f3-26a897cd494b	None	Russ Feingold	None	None	None	2016-08-26T05:00:00	2016-06-14	['Wisconsin']
pomt-12169	"A witness will testify against Hillary Clinton."	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/aug/03/blog-posting/internet-post-misleads-saying-witness-will-testify/	A story online that says a witness will speak out against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as part of a larger investigation into her actions is a muddled mix of real developments misleadingly retold. "Breaking: A witness will testify against Hillary Clinton," read the headline on a July 30, 2017, post on CoffeeBreakForYou.com. Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated as part of the social media site’s efforts to combat fake news. The post said that Clinton would be "held accountable for the many wrongdoings she has been charged with," although it never specifies what those charges may be. It said President Donald Trump had tasked Attorney General Jeff Sessions to investigate Clinton’s ties to Russia. That’s where the "key witness" comes in. "Glenn Simpson has been friends with the Clinton family for many years," the post read. "Not coincidentally, he is also a co-founder of the firm Fusion GPS that disseminated the widely debunked fake news dossier containing over-the-top stories about Donald Trump going to Russian hotels." The CoffeeBreakForYou.com article said the Senate Judiciary Committee had subpoenaed Simpson. The post asked readers whether they thought Simpson "will share crucial information about how Hillary attempted to frame Donald Trump." The story appears to have originated as a July 30 post on Conservative101.com. The byline on the post was Christopher Reynolds. We attempted to reach Conservative101.com through the website’s contact form (the only method of contact available) but didn’t get a response. The story isn't fake in the sense that it makes up all its content, but it does spin things to the point of being misleading or incorrect. The most notable issues are whether Clinton is really being investigated, and for what reasons the Senate Judiciary Committee wants to talk to Simpson. Trump has publicly criticized Sessions for failing to investigate Clinton for deleting emails from her private server and for allegedly getting information from Ukraine during her presidential campaign. The Justice Department has not publicly acknowledged an investigation into Clinton, although the Senate Judiciary Committee has demanded the agency disclose if it’s investigating the Ukrainian allegations. The Justice Department has until Aug. 3 to respond. House Republicans have requested FBI documents into the campaign investigation and have asked for a special counsel for a Clinton probe. The Senate committee has been looking into the extent of Russian influence on the 2016 election. Simpson is a real person. He is a former journalist who is a founding partner of opposition research firm Fusion GPS. Simpson was initially being subpoenaed for a hearing, but not explicitly to expose Clinton. The committee wanted to compel him to discuss details of his company’s Trump dossier, which became public in January 2017. Simpson wanted to protect the Democratic-leaning client who hired Fusion GPS to create the Trump dossier, according to the Daily Beast. Simpson had originally intended to invoke his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination, but struck a deal in which he would provide a transcribed interview. The Senate Judiciary Committee agreed and withdrew its subpoena. We couldn’t find any proof that Simpson was "friends with the Clinton family," although the New York Post reported that Fusion GPS was "actually an opposition-research group for Democrats, and the founders, who are more political activists than journalists, have a pro-Hillary Clinton, anti-Trump agenda." But trying to protect the identity of a Clinton ally who paid for opposition research against Trump is not the same as testifying against Clinton. In addition to the Trump opposition report, Fusion GPS also had reportedly worked to ease sanctions against Russia, through ties with Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya. She’s the same lawyer Donald Trump Jr. and former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort had met in a controversial and previously undisclosed 2016 meeting. Our ruling Bloggers said, "A witness will testify against Hillary Clinton." The post used details from several real news events in a way that would lead readers to draw some unproven conclusions. The article said that a founding partner in an opposition research firm was being called to testify against Clinton. Simpson was being asked to discuss details about a dossier filled with unsavory (and largely unsubstantiated) details about Trump as part of an investigation into Russian efforts to undermine the presidential election.

pomt-09013	The U.S. "only ranks 25th worldwide on defense spending as a percentage of GDP."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/09/sarah-palin/palin-says-us-ranks-25th-defense-spending-ranking/	In a June 30, 2010, Facebook post, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin posted excerpts from a speech she gave in Norfolk, Va., primarily on national security. At one point, she said, "Did you know the U.S. actually only ranks 25th worldwide on defense spending as a percentage of GDP?" We didn't, so we decided to check up on her statistic. We quickly tracked down the chart from which we suspect she pulled her factoid. (Her staff didn't return our e-mail query.) It's a credible source -- the CIA World Factbook -- and, as Palin said, the U.S. does rank 25th in the world, spending an estimated 4.06 percent of GDP on defense in 2005. Case closed? Not really. The list includes all countries, regardless of size, so some tiny countries outrank the United States on the CIA list. There's Eritrea at number 9 (with an economy about 1/1000th of the size of the U.S. economy); Burundi at number 11 (with an economy that's even less than 1/1000th the size of the U.S. economy); and Maldives at 13th (with an economy roughly the same size as Burundi's). Given this competition, several other states on the CIA's list seem like veritable economic powerhouses, such as Mauritania at 14th, Swaziland at 19th and Brunei at 22nd. Many of the states on the CIA list are modest-sized but live in a high-tension neighborhood -- the Middle East. They include the top seven, which are, in descending order, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Jordan, Israel and Yemen. A bit lower on the list are Syria, Kuwait, Turkey and Bahrain. All told, only four nations on the CIA list could be described as either industrialized democracies or major world players. They are Israel (6th), Turkey (16th), China (23rd) and Greece (24th). Is there a better yardstick? We think there is -- using rankings of members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The OECD is a group of 31 nations that are generally large, industrialized democracies. This list makes the comparison closer to one of peers. To make this comparison, we looked at a comprehensive table of defense spending compared to GDP that was published by the World Bank. First, two caveats: The figures are more recent than the ones used to create the CIA list, so they don't compare exactly. And we should note that varying definitions and a tendency toward secrecy make international military comparisons tricky. That said, compared to its 30 fellow members of the OECD, the U.S. trailed only one other member nation, Israel (at 8 percent of GDP, compared to 4.3 percent for the U.S.). In fact, the U.S. rate is double the rate of many of its peers. We also looked at China and Russia -- two nuclear powers that do not belong to the OECD -- and both of them also trail the U.S. in this measurement. Todd Harrison, a fellow with the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, said other factors set the U.S. apart. "In absolute dollars, we spend almost as much as all other countries combined," Harrison said. "So saying we are 25th is a bit misleading and a selective use of facts." We agree. Although she's technically correct, the numbers are wildly skewed by tiny, non-industrialized countries. We find her claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-01407	"In Massachusetts, Scott Brown pushed for a law to force women considering abortion -- force them -- to look at color photographs of developing fetuses."	mostly true	/new-hampshire/statements/2014/oct/10/jeanne-shaheen/jeanne-shaheen-says-scott-brown-wanted-women-look-/	As the 2014 New Hampshire Senate race veers toward a conclusion, the state’s next senator needs the support of women voters. Incumbent Jeanne Shaheen underscored that point when she targeted Republican challenger Scott Brown’s record supporting women’s reproductive rights during his tenure as a state senator from Massachusetts. Her aim was to undercut Brown’s assertion that he is a pro-choice politician. An ad with a female narrator released on Oct. 7 said, "In Massachusetts, Scott Brown pushed for a law to force women considering abortion -- force them -- to look at color photographs of developing fetuses." The ad, titled "Force," drew a swift response from Brown. He held a press conference the same day the ad was released, calling it a lie and adding that it was "not only insensitive, it is also deeply offensive." "I have always been a pro-choice, independent Republican and have a strong record of supporting women’s health care," Brown said in Derry, N.H., with his wife Gail by his side. Brown demanded that Shaheen pull the ad, and the next day he launched his own ad calling Shaheen’s commercial a "smear campaign." More than ever in this hotly contested Senate race, this seemed like a job for PolitiFact. For support, the ad, and Shaheen’s campaign, pointed to Massachusetts Senate Bill 979, "An Act Relative to a Woman’s Right to Know," filed in 2005. While the bill co-sponsored by Brown and Republican Michael R. Knapik eventually failed, it would have given any woman seeking an abortion information and mandated 24 hours to consider the consequences of that decision. (Exceptions would only be given in the case of a medical emergency.) "The purpose of the Woman's Right to Know Act is to ensure that every woman considering an abortion receives complete information on the procedure, the risks, the status of her unborn child, and her alternatives, and sufficient reflection time, thereby reducing the possibility of serious, lasting, or life threatening consequences of a medical, emotional and psychological nature," the bill states. Similar laws have been proposed and enacted in other states following a 1992 Supreme Court decision allowing the state of Pennsylvania under its "Abortion Control Act" to require a woman seeking an abortion to give her informed consent prior to the procedure, receive a host of information about abortion and adoption, and wait 24 hours before having an abortion. The introduction to the Massachusetts bill cites that Supreme Court decision, saying the state "has an important interest in ensuring that women seeking abortions are provided a fully informed choice and a sufficient period of time to reflect on the information provided, ‘to reduce the risk that a woman may elect an abortion, only to discover later, with devastating psychological consequences, that her decision was not fully informed.’ Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 882 (1992)." So how about those photographs of fetuses that women would be "forced" to look at? Like similar laws proposed and passed elsewhere, the proposed Massachusetts law would have required doctors or their representatives to provide women with lots of information at least 24 hours before an abortion was scheduled, including the names of adoption agencies and contact information for public and private agencies that offer financial and medical support to women throughout a pregnancy and after childbirth. It also required women to receive descriptions of the "anatomical and physiological characteristics of the unborn child at two week gestational increments from fertilization to full term, including color photographs." If photos were unavailable "realistic drawings" were considered acceptable. The bill made clear that photos of fetuses must be provided to women seeking abortions, but didn’t stop there. It also called for descriptions of the different methods of abortion and "the physical, psychological and emotional risks or medical complications commonly associated with each method; a description of the physical, psychological and emotional risks or medical complications of pregnancy and delivery; a description of the support obligations of the father of a child born alive." Before performing an abortion, the doctor or a representative would have to ask the woman if she had "seen" the information and "provide the woman with an opportunity to contact abortion alternative agencies at this time should she so desire." In addition, a woman’s signature was required before the abortion was performed to give her consent and "indicate that she has been offered the information described in this section." Brown says the bill was intended to give adoption a chance and "did not force women to do anything. I would never force women to do anything." He’s got a point. Nowhere in the bill is the word "force" used. Still, the language of the bill certainly ensures women would be given the information, asks them if they had "seen it," and provided at least 24 hours to review it before having an abortion. Our ruling Shaheen’s ad says that "in Massachusetts, Scott Brown pushed for a law to force women considering abortion -- force them -- to look at color photographs of developing fetuses." The measure backed by Brown nine years ago made sure that women were provided photos of developing fetuses, along with a lot more information. It certainly forced doctors and their representatives to provide this information to women seeking abortions -- except in cases of emergency -- and it ensured women received the information both through verbal questions and a signed consent form. Brown has a point that the bill wouldn't have "forced" them to look at color photographs -- but it did just about everything else it could possibly do up to that line. This statement is accurate but needs clarification, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Jeanne Shaheen	None	None	None	2014-10-10T14:11:14	2014-10-07	['Massachusetts']
pomt-06883	Says Republican state Sen. Alberta Darling offered "unqualified support" for a plan to end Medicare	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jul/29/we-are-wisconsin/we-are-wisconsin-says-state-senator-alberta-darlin/	State Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, handed her recall opponent a big opening when she was asked about U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan’s hotly debated Medicare plan and heaped praise on him. Or did she? At a June 10, 2011, fundraiser in Milwaukee, Darling told an audience during questions and answers that Ryan is "doing the exact right thing to try to reform" Medicare. Her comments are available to anyone, thanks to a new reality in partisan politics: Once-private talks are now routinely captured on video by bloggers, political parties or interested groups. In this case, one of the two videos of Darling’s remarks was done for We Are Wisconsin, the labor coalition backing Democrats in the Senate recalls. The Progressive WI channel on YouTube posted a long version on June 11, 2011, and We Are Wisconsin put up a shorter but better-quality video on June 13, 2011. The Journal Sentinel wrote about it on June 14, 2011, in an All Politics blog post headlined, "Darling backs Ryan’s Medicare plan." A few weeks passed, but then things really got interesting. The National Journal reported Darling told one of its reporters in June that she had taken no position on Ryan’s plan at the fundraiser. "I didn’t say I supported his Medicare effort," the publication quoted Darling as saying. Around the same time, state Rep. Sandy Pasch, D-Whitefish Bay, Darling’s opponent in the August recall election, put up a TV spot saying Darling "supports ending Medicare" -- a reference to the recorded comments. Then on July 14, 2011, after a protest at her office, Andrew Davis, Darling’s campaign manager, told Fox Point-Bayside Patch: "Senator Darling has no opinion on the matter." The reaction was swift. The next day We Are Wisconsin blasted Darling and Ryan in a July 15 news release, saying she was dishonestly denying her "unqualified," "unequivocal," "unwavering," "ironclad" support for a "radical plan that ends Medicare" or proposes "gutting" it or would "scrap" it. Strong words. Does the video tell the tale of "unqualified support"? We’ll look at a claim in two parts: (1) that Darling offered unqualified support for Ryan’s plan and (2) that Ryan’s plan would "end" Medicare. There is no dispute about the authenticity of the video. As these things go, the question-and-answer exchange is actually clear. Darling’s camp says her answer was unscripted, but she was fully aware the exchange was being recorded. Her remarks are not an aside; she eagerly took the microphone and spoke for more than a minute. The question from an unidentified male was direct: "What do you think of Representative Ryan’s Medicare changes?" Here’s the full exchange: "You know, I was asked at the beginning of the week what I think about Rep. Ryan’s Medicare reforms, and they were trying to tie me to Ryan and thought that would be a negative for me. "I said, ‘I’m standing with Ryan anytime, anywhere. He’s a leader.’ And I said ‘You guys are lying about what he’s doing with Medicare ... 55 and older Medicare stays; 55 and younger, there are new reforms so that health care actions can be available when people get to be seniors." She finished: "So, I think Paul Ryan is doing the exact right thing to try to reform Medicaid because Medicaid is going to go broke. But they’re lying. People 55 and older will keep Medicare. 55 and younger will have a reform of Medicare to have options so that health care can continue. "Totally, go Paul Ryan!" Darling said to applause. "They are trying to label that as a negative. I said, " ‘Are you kidding, he’s absolutely a hero.’ " We requested an interview with Darling; she declined. Davis provided written answers to our questions. In her response to us, Darling did not take a position on Ryan’s plan, instead reiterating she can’t vote on Medicare changes, and she admires Ryan’s leadership on the issue. "I did not and do not endorse Congressman Ryan’s plan," her response said. "I do not want to see Medicare end, I want to see it continue to provide for our seniors. But if we do not do anything about it, it’s not going to be there for future generations." The intent of her answer at the event, Darling’s statement said, was to "combat the lies" about Ryan’s plan. Davis said Darling’s "exact right thing" remark was only in reference to Ryan’s taking on the issue, not the specifics of his plan. Kelly Steele, spokesman for We Are Wisconsin, countered that Darling discusses details of the plan and shows her cards by saying Ryan’s attempt at Medicare reform is the "exact right thing." The group says Darling is now reacting to residents’ concerns about cuts to Medicare. "Her attempt to walk this back is laughable," Steele said. "I have not seen a more unequivocal embrace of Paul Ryan’s plan than that piece of video." Let’s go back to the tape -- and the We Are Wisconsin claim -- and examine the two pieces of this. For her part, Darling’s campaign contends she only embraced Ryan and Ryan’s drive to reform Medicare -- not the specifics. But she discusses and defends key aspects of it, and -- in response to a question about what she thought about the plan -- offers that he is doing the "exact right thing." If Darling wanted to express neutrality, she could have prefaced her comments or framed them as such. She could have embraced Ryan and still made clear she was taking no position on his plan. Instead she offers not even a hint of concern or caution about Ryan’s plan and invites the conclusion that she backs it wholeheartedly with comments such as "totally, go" and "standing with Ryan anytime, anywhere." Most importantly, the question wasn’t Ryan’s courage or his place in history -- it was what she thought of his plan. The question, perhaps designed for this purpose, was specific. We think many listeners would judge her remarks in that narrow context and take her enthusiastic back-slapping comments as at least a general endorsement of his plan. But Darling didn’t come right out and say she endorses his plan. And this was an apparently unscripted response at a GOP fundraiser where you might expect Darling to lead cheers for Ryan. We could find no other, more formal statements by Darling on the plan. Looking at the whole context, though, we think it’s generally true Darling offered unqualified support. Now the back end of the claim. The problem for We Are Wisconsin is that it says Ryan’s plan would "end" or "scrap" Medicare. The group qualifies the language at times, but the overwhelming impression left is that Ryan’s plan would mean the end of Medicare -- and that this is what Darling supported. PolitiFact has repeatedly ruled False the notion that Ryan’s plan would end the program. It would change dramatically, yes, but it would still exist. So where does that leave this two-part statement on the Truth-O-Meter? On balance, we rate the statement from the group Half True.

pomt-10887	"Both China and Japan have surpassed us, with Japanese cars now getting an average of 45 miles to the gallon."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/jun/21/barack-obama/technically-correct-but-uses-unrealistic-numbers/	In a speech to the Detroit Economic Club on May 7, 2007, Obama said the U.S. needs to make more fuel-efficient cars. "While our fuel standards haven't moved from 27.5 miles per gallon in two decades, both China and Japan have surpassed us, with Japanese cars now getting an average of 45 miles to the gallon." Obama's claim about Japanese cars getting more than 45 mpg involves the fuzzy science of measuring fuel economy, complicated by differing standards in each nation. Obama's campaign says his number comes from a 2004 study by the Pew Center on Global Climate Change that calculated Japanese cars would get 46 mpg if Japan followed the same test methods as the U.S. (Obama accurately says the U.S. mandate has been 27.5 for 20 years.) Obama's claim is technically correct. But the Pew numbers exaggerate the differences between the countries because those estimates do not reflect real-world conditions, according to Lee Schipper, director of research at the World Resources Institute's Center for Transport and Environment. He says the Japanese fleet actually averages about 23 mpg on the road today, but is improving. The U.S. number is only slightly lower, about 21, but has been stagnant. The real-world numbers are closer because, despite more fuel-efficient cars in Japan, heavy traffic congestion erases much of the efficiency. Schipper said Obama "is correct that Japan's fuel efficiency is higher and improving more rapidly, but his number is inaccurate. The number he used doesn't really represent a realistic on-road achievement." Yet Schipper said he doesn't fault Obama for the confusion. "Everybody makes this mistake. What matters is what cars really get on the road, how long it takes to change the entire fleet and how much people drive." (Japanese drivers drive about one-third as many miles per year as U.S. drivers.)	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2007-06-21T00:00:00	2007-05-07	['Japan', 'China']
pomt-10352	The U.S. government spends less on energy innovation "than the pet food industry invests in its own products."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/11/barack-obama/this-dog-wont-hunt/	Sen. Barack Obama says the United States has its priorities about energy research all wrong: Case in point, the government spends less on energy research than the pet food industry does on its own research and development. That's the claim Democratic nominee Obama makes in his "Plan to Make America a Global Energy Leader," to explain why he wants to increase the amount the government spends on energy innovation. "At present, the federal government spends over $3 billion per year on all energy innovation efforts," the Obama plan states. "While this may seem like a significant sum, it is much less than what we spent in the late 1970s when adjusted for inflation, and is less than the pet food industry invests in its own products." A June 2008 Harvard study confirms that the part about the 1970s is true. In inflation-adjusted dollars, the government was spending more than $6 billion a year on energy research and development in the late 1970s, which is more than double what it's spending this year. But that second claim? The pet food one? The Obama campaign declined to explain what the Illinois senator meant, exactly, by "invests in its own products." Instead, it referred Politifact to an August 2007 article by University of California (Berkeley) Professor Daniel M. Kammen, which makes precisely the same point Obama did: "The federal government spends less on energy research and development than the U.S. pet food industry spends on its products in the United States," Kammen wrote. The article, on global warming, contains no footnotes to support the pet food assertion, doesn't expand upon it beyond that one sentence, and Kammen did not respond to several requests for comment. That forces us to take the Obama statement as any voter would: at face value. In his article, Kammen refers to pet food industry spending, which it could be argued, refers to everything the industry spends on its products, from raw materials to packaging to advertising. But Obama uses the word "invests" – and given the parallel construction of his argument – it reads to us like a comparison between federal government energy research and pet food industry research, (i.e. the development of new products.) For its part, the Pet Food Institute, the trade association for the industry, says that it doesn't keep such figures, leaving us to wonder where Kammen got them. But a 2006 study by consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton, which examined the 1,000 companies across all industries that spend the most on research and development, found that on average those companies spent 3.8 percent of their gross sales on R&D.; Given that the pet food industry as a whole grosses about $15 billion a year in sales, it's inconceivable that the industry spends more on new product research than the $3-billion the government spends on energy R&D.; That would be 20 percent of gross sales. As a result, we find Obama's claim to be False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-07-11T00:00:00	2008-07-11	['United_States']
pomt-04104	"200 consumer laws were destroyed" in 2011 when Gov. Scott Walker signed Act 92.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jan/14/vince-megna/vince-megna-says-gov-scott-walker-destroyed-200-co/	Vince Megna, the Milwaukee attorney known as "King of the Lemon Laws," is mincing no words as he runs a partisan-style race attempting to unseat Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Patience Roggensack. In a profanity-laced, theatrical series of YouTube videos and on his campaign website, the man who built a national reputation taking on auto companies and other big corporations goes after Gov. Scott Walker and other Republicans. Megna is running in the spring 2013 race as a liberal Democrat even though the contest is officially nonpartisan. He considers Roggensack a Republican, a claim we won’t deal with here. One of Megna’s big talking points is the measure by GOP lawmakers in 2011 -- in what became Act 92-- that limited attorney fees in the kind of cases that are Megna’s bread and butter. "Governor Scott Walker signed into law the most destructive anti-consumer protection bill in Wisconsin history," Megna’s website says. "With one swipe of the pen, 200 consumer laws were destroyed and more than 40 years of case law development was rendered moot." We’re not going to compare the measure with every consumer bill since statehood. But we will test whether "200 consumer laws were destroyed" by it. A bit of background first. Rep. Robin Vos, R-Rochester, who is now the Assembly speaker, shepherded through the 2011 bill after a car dealer in his district fought a lawsuit by a man who said the dealership did about $5,000 of unauthorized work on his new truck. Megna was an attorney for the truck owner. A Racine County judge ruled in the dealer’s favor. But the state Court of Appeals ruled the truck owner didn’t have to pay if he didn’t authorize the work.It sent the case back to the lower court. Three days before subsequent trial at the lower court, the two sides settled, with the dealer paying $12,500 for damages and interest, $151,250 in legal fees and $5,284 in costs. The Vos-backed bill said judges should presume that reasonable attorneys fees do not exceed three times the amount of compensatory damages. But judges can lift the cap under certain circumstances. Over the objections of Democrats and consumer advocates, the law took effect in December 2011, so it’s slightly more than a year old. When we asked Megna how the measure "destroyed 200 consumer laws," he backed off a bit, saying he did not mean it in a literal sense. Indeed, in 2011, he told reporters the effect would be to "virtually repeal" the statutes. He repeated that to PolitiFact Wisconsin, saying that Walker’s action amounts towiping out the statutes because lawyers will be wary of representing tenants, discrimination victims and buyers of defective cars given the possible fee limits. "Those are effectively wiped out because you can’t find attorneys who will represent you," he said. Let’s take a look under the hood. The law clearly can affect lawyer’s fees in many matters brought under so-called "fee-shifting" cases -- matters in which laws give consumers the right to recover attorney’s fees from the other side if they prevail. As many as 280 statutory and administrative causes of action could fall under the three-times-damages cap, according to an October 2012 analysis in the Wisconsin Lawyer, a publication of the State Bar of Wisconsin. The Bar opposed the legislation, saying it would also hurt businesses’ legal defense against frivolous claims brought by someone who has actually violated the law. Many of those 200-plus statutes are related to consumer protection; some are not. But did the legislation "destroy" them? We contacted consumer lawyers and those who defend businesses and found general agreement that the law will spawn changes, some potentially significant -- and in the eyes of lawyers for consumers, harmful to their cause because they believe getting a lawyer will be more difficult. But none went so far as to say consumer laws that allow legal action had been destroyed or eliminated. Attorney David Dudley represented many low-income clients from an office in Madison and relied exclusively on attorney-fee-shift provisions for its operation. He closed the office after the law took effect, blaming the legislation for the move. He now works for the federal government. DeVonna Joy, a southeast-Wisconsin consumer lawyer, told us she now turns down more potential clients. Proving even small claims cases can cost a lot, the cap is "absurdly low" in many cases, and defense lawyers are dragging out more cases to pressure plaintiffs to settle, she said. Joy acknowledged that other lawyers might be picking up some of the clients she’s rejected, but she said many already have been turned down multiple times when she hears from them. Brian Schuk, a Delavan attorney who represents tenants and sometimes landlords, says he now refuses many smaller cases even when there is an obvious violation of the law. So now, more of those people don’t end up suing, or try to take on landlords without representation, he said. At the University of Wisconsin-Madison, two professors active in public-interest law, Sarah Orr and Mitch, said it was too early to judge the ultimate impact, but both said fewer cases would be brought on behalf of consumers and tenants in matters such as fraud, debt collection and consumer-law violations. Note: Mitch officially has no last name. But not all lawyers are trimming their caseloads -- including Megna himself. Megna told us that his own practice is mainly intact because he handles some big-ticket cases that allow him to continue to handle smaller cases. We also spoke with lawyers who often find themselves defending clients against consumer claims. Tristan Pettit, a Milwaukee lawyer who frequently represents residential landlords and businesses, said he has not seen much effect one way or another. Lisa Lawless, another Milwaukee lawyer, said the law’s impact is still an open question, but predicted that lawyers representing consumers would be more "reasonable" about settling cases faster. She praised the law, and said the fee cap was fair, but added that it could be an issue for lawyers taking on small damage claims. Both say they have not noticed a drop-off in cases. Finally, it’s worth noting again that the new law presumes a cap at three times damages, but a judge can go higher. Megna acknowledged that it’s too early to say whether judges will allow fees above the suggested cap. Many cases in front of judges now were filed before the law went into effect and thus not covered by the limits. But many lawyers who handle cases affected by the law predict the cap will become the standard -- in part because busy judges can’t take the time to sort out what is reasonable on fees. Our rating Megna described the impact of Act 92 in stark and dramatic terms saying that "200 consumer laws were destroyed" when Walker signed it. It seems clear that the changes tilt the playing field against consumers in some significant ways, but the laws remain on the books and litigation will continue at some level -- perhaps reduced, but it’s premature to say. Megna’s claim misleadingly suggests Walker and Republican legislators wiped hundreds of statutes off the books. We rate his claim False.

pomt-10654	"Average families are spending roughly $2,000 more a year on energy costs. ... It's like a $2,000 energy tax in just the last seven years, more than three times what the typical American family received from the Bush tax cuts."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/02/hillary-clinton/her-comparison-is-too-selective/	Even staunch Democrats probably recall the guilty pleasure of spending their extra cash from the Bush tax cuts. And just about every American has felt the pinch at the gas pump lately. So which had a bigger impact on your wallet? Are you flush from the Bush tax cuts, or did rising energy prices wipe out the fleeting boon? Sen. Hillary Clinton thinks rising energy prices wiped out your family's tax savings — three times over. Whether she's right or wrong depends on several factors. "It depends on how much you drive, and how much you earn," said Len Burman, director of the Tax Policy Institute. (He bikes to work.) Let's start with Clinton's energy number. PolitiFact doesn't know where she got it, since Clinton's camp did not respond to inquiries. But here's what we found. From 2001 to 2006, "average annual energy and gasoline costs have increased by over $2,300," according to "The Middle-Class Squeeze," a September 2006 congressional committee report prepared for Reps. Nancy Pelosi and Henry Waxman, both California Democrats. The report included the gasoline in your car, oil to heat your home, and fuel for electricity. It also included some tough-to-measure "pass-through" costs, such as higher retail prices because of higher shipping costs. Going by this report, Clinton's energy number seems reasonable. Now, for the tax cuts. In 2001, the White House said, "Under the President's tax relief plan, the typical American family of four will be able to keep at least $1,600 more of their own money." That's not how it necessarily worked out, said Burman. A median-income family held on to $744 in 2006 as a result of the tax cuts, according to a Tax Policy Center analysis. Well, it happens that $2,300 is three times more than $744. But PolitiFact finds Clinton's comparison too selective. It appears she's comparing a single year of tax savings (2006) to an escalation in energy prices that took several years. What happens if you add up each year's tax savings, and then add up each year's change in energy costs? After all, oil and gas prices actually dropped in late 2001 and into 2002. The answer is, we don't know. To do that kind of a calculation, over so many years, one would have to account for changing tax laws, inflation, income changes, energy use, driving patterns, what people bought, even the weather. In short, it's not a number that is tracked by the Energy Information Administration or the Tax Policy Center. Maybe the Clinton campaign did all of that, but if so they're not sharing it with us. We're left with somewhat accurate numbers from Clinton (judging by one report) that tell only part of the story of energy costs vs. tax savings. At our generous best, we can only give her a Half True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2008-01-02T00:00:00	2007-11-19	['United_States', 'George_W._Bush']
pomt-07151	"China owns about 29 percent of (the U.S.) debt.''	false	/florida/statements/2011/jun/14/allen-west/rep-allen-west-says-china-holds-29-percent-us-debt/	China's economic muscle and the U.S. debt are common worries in Congress these days. Republican Congressman Allen West, who represents parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties, weighed in during an interview about China on Fox News June 2. Anchor Jenna Lee asked: "How would you deal with China, especially with our economic ties right now? I mean, what's the way forward?" West replied: "Well, I think that that is one of the key things that we need to be talking about, when we look at the debt that we have and China owns about 29 percent of that debt." West linked to the interview on his website. Is West's figure right -- does China own about 29 percent of the U.S. debt? We asked spokeswoman Angela Sachitano for an explanation. She sent us back a link to a March 25, 2011, report from the Congressional Research Service titled "Foreign Holdings of Federal Debt." Note the word "foreign." Table 2 shows the top 10 "foreign holders" of federal debt, and Mainland China is at the top, with about $1.16 trillion or 26.1 percent (Japan is No. 2). This means China holds about 26 percent of "foreign investment in U.S. privately held federal debt," the report states. Our colleagues at PolitiFact Georgia weighed in on a similar claim by Herman Cain, a Republican presidential candidate, who spoke about China's share of the U.S. debt at a tea party event in Iowa on April 16. We rated Cain's claim False. "If we don't begin to grow with the potential that we have in this country, we will have another national security crisis, and that national security crisis is that China will be as big as we are," Cain said. "They'll start to develop a military as big and as good as ours, and they've got a billion more people and they're holding 26 percent of our debt. And you think we're going to be able to sing Kumbaya with them?" After examining a U.S. Treasury Department report of foreign holders of treasury securities as of March, PolitiFact concluded: "According to the report, as of February of this year, China held $1.15 trillion worth of U.S. Treasury securities. Together, all foreign holders came to $4.47 trillion. So China's share of that comes to about 26 percent. China, incidentally, tops the list of foreign holders of U.S. debt, followed by Japan and then, with a much smaller share, countries such as the United Kingdom and Brazil. "But that's just the foreign holders of Treasury securities. More than two-thirds of the debt is held by U.S. residents and institutions. When you look at everyone who holds U.S. Treasury securities, China's share drops to 8.1 percent ($1.15 trillion out of $14 trillion)." (For the West fact-check, we contacted the U.S. Treasury to ask whether that report had been updated since March and were told that it was the most recent data available.) PolitiFact National continued: "Of course, there are lots of ways to slice debt statistics. For example, instead of gross federal debt (the figure cited above), some people prefer to use a figure for 'debt held by the public.' That's the gross federal debt minus the share of the debt held by the U.S. government itself. That was $9.4 trillion at the end of 2010. Which would put the portion held by China at about 12.3 percent. There are also Chinese holdings of debt outside of Treasuries, said Derek Scissors of the conservative Heritage Foundation. But that doesn't get Cain anywhere near his 26 percent figure. "Even stretching, you can't get past 15.6 percent of our debt as held by China and I would not use that number," Scissors said. The number cited by Cain is "misleadingly large," Scissors said. "He's not talking about our debt, he's talking about the foreign share of our debt. If you are going to use that number, you really have to explain it." We told Sachitano that West's figure was close to China's share of the foreign-held U.S. debt. She replied by e-mail: "No misrepresentation." She also referred us to slides on West's website, which he uses at town-hall meetings. On his slide show, however, West's pie charts correctly show China's share of the U.S. debt held by foreigners, a distinction he didn't make on Fox News. The 29 percent figure that West mentioned on Fox is even higher than what Cain had cited, and we've already labeled that too high. The number West used is also wrong. Although on TV he left out only a couple words, those words matter because they make a big difference here. He could have explained that he was referring to foreign holders of U.S. debt -- but he didn't. So his statement makes it appear that China owns a much larger chunk of the federal debt than it does. We rate this claim False.	None	Allen West	None	None	None	2011-06-14T12:11:22	2011-06-02	['United_States', 'China']
pomt-12887	Say George Soros's money "went straight into the (Women’s March) protesters’ pockets."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/25/blog-posting/pants-fire-george-soros-money-womens-march-protest/	According to several blog posts, the women’s marches around the country did not reflect grassroots concern over the policies of President Donald Trump. Rather, they were the work of the liberal billionaire philanthropist George Soros. The Constitution.com blog posted that "the liberal media and Democrat pundits are mischaracterizing the past weekend’s march as grassroots. Listening to them, people would believe that the participants were sincere, spontaneous and concerned citizens. While some were genuine, most were paid minions." The post went on to say, "George Soros funded over 50 organizations partnering and participating in the March for Women’s Rights. Part of that funding went straight into the protesters pockets. They weren’t there for rights. They were there for riches." In this fact-check, we focus on whether Soros money went into the pockets of protesters. There is no evidence that's true. We used the Constitution.com website’s contact form to ask where they got their information and did not hear back. However, the blog cited an opinion piece by Asra Nomani that appeared on the Women in the World section of the New York Times website. Nomani’s article voiced her displeasure with the anti-Trump focus of the march. As a self-identified liberal feminist and Trump supporter, she said she did not feel welcome. Nomani went through the list of 403 groups listed as partners of the march and found that "Soros has funded, or has close relationships with, at least 56 of the march’s ‘partners,’ including ‘key partners’ Planned Parenthood, which opposes Trump’s anti-abortion policy, and the National Resource Defense Council, which opposes Trump’s environmental policies." Nomani told us that she has now counted 65 organizations with some sort of tie, not necessarily financial, to Soros and his philanthropic organization, the Open Society Foundation. We looked at Nomani’s spreadsheet of march partners annotated with any ties to the Open Society Foundation. It is unclear exactly how many groups currently receive foundation support. Some got money for projects several years ago. For others, the connection is indirect, such as participating in programs that Soros’ Open Society Foundation also supports. No matter the number of organizations or the amount of money they may have received, Nomani never claimed that Soros’ Open Society was paying individual protestors. In an interview with PolitiFact, Nomani rejected the claims of other bloggers. "I definitely do not conclude that most of the people marching were paid to do so," Nomani said. "I believe that most of the people were motivated by sincere political and ideological beliefs. I do believe that most of the participants in the march had genuine concerns. It is not factual that they were paid to march." But what about the role Soros money paid in making the marches happen at all? Nomani said, "The march organizers have not yet revealed their funding sources, so it is unclear who directly funded the march." For its part, the Open Society Foundation sent us a statement saying there is "no truth" to reports that either Soros or the foundation funded the protests. "We have long supported a wide range of organizations, including those that support women and minorities who have historically been denied equal rights," the statement said. "Many of them are concerned about what policy changes may lie ahead. We are proud of their work. We of course support the right of all Americans to peaceably assemble and petition their government -- a vital, and constitutionally safeguarded, pillar of a functioning democracy." Our ruling Bloggers said many participants in the women’s marches were motivated by money from Soros and his Open Society Foundation. The person whose work lies behind that rejects that claim and said she believes "most of the people were motivated by sincere political and ideological beliefs."

pomt-15277	"With the exception of baby formula, the federal government does not require any food to carry an expiration date, and state laws vary widely."	true	/punditfact/statements/2015/jul/27/john-oliver/john-oliver-hits-regulatory-gap-food-last-week-ton/	Ever wonder about the accuracy of your milk carton’s expiration date? Or exactly how late is too late to eat that apple? So did comedian John Oliver. He used the July 19 episode of his HBO show Last Week Tonight to discuss the issue of food waste, zooming in on little-known regulatory gaps that he argued cause mass confusion over the meaning and purpose of date labels on food. "With the exception of baby formula," Oliver said, "the federal government does not require any food to carry an expiration date, and state laws vary widely." And of the 50 states, he went on, nine don’t require any labels at all. The confusing issue has been well documented over several decades, though we doubt it’s ever been the target of an 18-minute monologue in a late-night comedy show. We wanted to see if Oliver had it right. Chaotic laws, confusing labels Oliver was right in saying, with the exception of infant formula, the federal government does not require any food to carry an expiration date. Experts say it would be almost impossible to set up an effective umbrella regulation for labeling foods with expiration dates. The diversity of climates and crops in the United States means it’s hard to judge the pace at which different foods deteriorate in different places. A piece of fruit left out in the hot, humid fields of Georgia might spoil faster than the same piece of fruit left out in the cool, dry mountains of Colorado. In the absence of an overarching federal statute, a jumble of laws at the state level dictate which foods require date labels. The comedian’s research team got the bulk of its data from a 2013 report compiled by the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental think tank, and the Harvard Food Law and Policy Clinic. The study found that most states have laws that require date labels on some foods. Oliver cites the report’s finding that nine states don’t require any date labels, including New York, Idaho and Alabama. Of those nine, seven states don’t have regulations that govern the labels that manufacturers voluntarily place on products. These inconsistencies can make it hard to do business across state lines, said Emily Broad Leib, the study’s lead author and director of the Harvard Food Law and Policy Clinic. Laws in Montana and Pennsylvania require milk to be sold 12 and 17 days after pasteurization, respectively, but don’t allow the milk to be donated if it goes unsold in that time. "Without federal guidance," Leib said, "some state laws require that (unspoiled) food be thrown away." The Montana law prompted some out-of-state dairy farmers to argue that the law unfairly protects in-state producers. Label it what you want The regulatory gap also leads to confusion about what food labels actually mean. As a news clip in Oliver’s segment illustrates, one might see the same product labeled "sell by" or "use by," or it may have no label at all. Most retailers and manufacturers use a labeling system referred to as "open dating." Though it might sound like a relationship status, "open dating" simply means that a calendar date is displayed on a product instead of a code that only makes sense to the producer. Perhaps surprisingly, the dates on these labels aren’t regulated. This means it’s entirely up to the manufacturer to decide what date to print on the labels in all 50 states. (The strictest federal regulation of this kind applies to poultry, but it allows the use of a packing date instead of a sell-by date.) The purpose of manufacturers’ date labels isn’t to ensure safety, but quality, according to the USDA. Oliver suggests that because manufacturers are free to determine their own best-by dates, they may have a financial incentive to falsify them. But one expert said he wasn’t convinced manufacturers try to help out their bottom lines by making it seem like food perishes faster than reality. Quality standards almost always consider safety, said Keith Schneider, a food microbiologist at the University of Florida’s Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences. Keeping a customer happy means also keeping them safe. "These dates are usually based on lab tests and historical precedents," he said. Most of all, he said, manufacturers want to build brand loyalty by consistently guaranteeing fresh, safe food, so they are often overly conservative with sell-by and use-by dates. Leib said it would be difficult to prove a producer manipulates its dates to boost profits, "but it would be perfectly easy to falsify that information." Still, manufacturers have an interest in ensuring quality, and many times smaller companies don’t have the money to test their products and apply accurate sell-by dates. "Sometimes," she said, "dates are just made up." Our rating Oliver said, "With the exception of baby formula, the federal government does not require any food to carry an expiration date, and state laws vary widely." While Oliver’s underlying argument for more regulation can be debated, he’s right to say that the federal government doesn’t require expiration dates on food, and state laws filling in that gap are inconsistent.

pomt-05407	"We didn’t go out asking people" to join the "stand your ground" task force.	false	/florida/statements/2012/may/03/jennifer-carroll/jennifer-carroll-apply-stand-your-ground-task-forc/	Lawmakers and lawyers clamored to join the task force set up by Gov. Rick Scott to examine Florida’s justifiable homicide laws after Trayvon Martin’s shooting death. The clamoring turned to confusion when Lt. Gov. Jennifer Carroll, whom Scott designated co-chair, explained how the panel’s members were chosen. "What we did was go to the individuals that seek our approval to be on the task force. We didn’t go out asking people," she said at an April 19 news conference. "They came to us with an interest in this review, and those are the people of the pool that we went and looked at, who would be best to serve on this task force given the diversity of the state." Reporters asked Carroll about Sen. Chris Smith, a South Florida Democrat and prominent "stand your ground" critic who publicly asked to be on the panel. "He did not apply," Carroll said. "We went with the application, people that sent in information who were interested in serving on this task force." Carroll’s comments immediately surprised some lawmakers. As we heard doubts about an application process, we started digging up more information about how the committee came together. Was Carroll accurate that no one recruited people to the task force? In March, Scott said the task force would be led by Carroll and the Rev. R.B. Holmes of Tallahassee and comprised of appointees from Attorney General Pam Bondi, House Speaker Dean Cannon, Senate President Mike Haridopolos, Senate President-designate Don Gaetz and House Speaker-designate Will Weatherford. Sen. Gary Siplin, D-Orlando, who was chosen to sit on the 19-member task force, said he knew nothing about an application. He simply told Haridopolos he was interested. The same goes for Smith. (Read Smith’s letter to Haridopolos.) "When the governor announced his task force, he stated who he’d get recommendations from," said Smith, who started his own task force to look into the law. "I called those people and expressed my desire to serve. And I’ve expressed publicly in many news outlets my desire to serve. So I was surprised that there was an application process that I did not know about." Here’s what we know about the process. In short, some members were chosen because they asked to be, like Carroll said. But we found several cases where task force members said explicitly that they were recruited, some by Carroll’s own chief of staff. Haridopolos, the Senate president, recommended Scott choose one senator from a list of seven senators that included four Democrats -- Larcenia Bullard of Miami, Arthenia Joyner of Tampa, Siplin and Smith -- and three Republicans -- David Simmons of Altamonte Springs, Andy Gardiner of Orlando and Greg Evers of Crestview, according to a March 28 letter. Siplin and Simmons made the cut. Cannon also made a recommendation. Unlike Haridopolos, he went outside of his chamber. Public records show the House speaker recommended Orlando attorney Derek Bruce, who filled out a standard questionnaire for gubernatorial appointees. "The speaker reached out to Mr. Bruce and recommended him to the governor because he thought he would be a good fit for the task force," said House spokesman Ryan Duffy. There’s no evidence in House records that Bruce lobbied Cannon to be on the task force. Speaker-designate Weatherford also had some picks: Rep. Dennis Baxley, R-Ocala, who sponsored the 2005 "stand your ground" law, and Rep. Jason Brodeur, a Republican from Sanford, where Martin was shot. When Baxley heard Scott’s instructions, he told us that he called Weatherford and asked him to submit his name for the task force. Brodeur didn’t ask to be on the task force. But he readily agreed to it when Weatherford called, he said. Bondi nominated two law enforcement leaders, Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings and Florida State Police Chief David Perry, to the task force a week later. She approached them, spokeswoman Jennifer Meale said. No application. Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle told us she received an out-of-the-blue call about joining the committee from Carroll’s chief of staff, John Konkus. "He said that they would like me to be on it," she said. "I asked some questions about who else was on there, what was the time frame." She accepted his offer the next morning. "I consider it a real duty," she said. So does Gretchen Lorenzo, a crime prevention coordinator for the Fort Myers police department. She said Konkus called the department, requesting that she be placed on the task force. "I was appointed," she said. "It was a great opportunity for our city." Task force member Maria Newman, 64, who stopped volunteering with her neighborhood crime watch unit two years ago, tells a similar story. She said a friend on the Melbourne Police Department asked her if she wanted to be on the task force. "I look at it as I’m taking a journey," Newman said. "Hopefully my little voice will go a long ways." Miami community organizer Edna Canino deflected when asked about whether she was recruited onto the task force or volunteered herself, saying "I don’t think that’s important at this time." So we know several members of the task force were essentially recruited by Carroll, Cannon or Bondi. It puts a hole in Carroll’s claim that the selections were entirely based on people who "came to us with an interest in the review." We did find one person to support that claim: Tampa criminal defense attorney Joe Caimano, who emailed Cannon about serving. In an email, he wrote that his experience litigating "stand your ground" cases would be valuable. He ended up on the task force, though we’re not sure who made the decision since Cannon only recommended Derek Bruce. We made a public records request for all correspondence -- including any "applications" -- between those interested in the task force and the governor’s office on April 19, shortly after the news conference ended. It remained unfulfilled as of May 2, although the governor's office said it would get back to us shortly. A spokeswoman for Scott clarified Carroll’s comments on April 25, a week after the request, saying, "There was no formal application process." Spokeswoman Jackie Schutz added: "Sen. Smith never made his interest in serving on the task force known to our office." Konkus also called us on May 2 to explain there were no cold calls, but that some people had been recommended without their knowledge. "Several people had their names put forward from other voices across the state," he said. Our ruling Carroll said "we didn’t go out asking people" to join the task force charged with examining Florida’s "stand your ground" law. "They came to us," she said. This was accurate for several members, including Baxley, Siplin and Caimano (there could be more, but we can’t know that without Scott’s office fulfilling our records request). But we found several instances of the panel’s organizers inviting people to join, including a state attorney and crime prevention coordinator personally recruited by Carroll’s top aide. That's not how Carroll put it at the news conference, when she spoke of an application process. We rate Carroll’s claim False.

pomt-06886	Says Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel "supports allowing the United States to default on its obligations."	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2011/jul/28/ohio-democratic-party/ohio-democratic-party-accuses-josh-mandel-endorsin/	Josh Mandel, who was elected Ohio treasurer last November, has not officially announced he is running for the U.S. Senate next year. But that has not kept the Republican from raising money like a candidate or from collecting endorsements such as that of the Senate Conservatives Fund. The fund is a political action committee headed by U.S. Sen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina, founder of the Senate’s Tea Party Caucus. The group said it was "launching an all out SCF surge" to raise money for Mandel, who "strongly supports all of the SCF policy goals." That drew the attention of the Ohio Democratic Party, which looked at those goals and issued a statement saying that Mandel "supports allowing the United States to default on its obligations." The statement said the "extreme stand" puts him in disagreement with Ohio Republicans like Sen. Rob Portman and U.S. House Speaker John Boehner. PolitiFact Ohio asked for evidence. Democratic Party spokesman Justin Barasky directed us specifically to a video posted by Ohio Dems and to the endorsement statement of the Senate Conservatives Fund. Barasky said they show Mandel opposes raising the debt limit, "and by definition (in taking that position) you are endorsing default." The 1 minute 43 second video asserts in its first 20 seconds that Mandel supports allowing the U.S. to go into default, citing an email from the Senate Conservatives Fund as the source. The remainder quotes a variety of sources, including Portman and Boehner, on the dangers of default, and quotes President Ronald Reagan from 1985 on the need to raise the federal debt ceiling. We then looked at the SCF statement. In it, DeMint wrote: "Sherrod Brown supports raising the debt limit. Mandel opposes it." We next called Mandel's spokesman on political matters, Anthony Conchel, to ask about Mandel's position on default. "I'm not going to respond to that," he said, instead providing a quote from Mandel that he said "mirrors his public comments" on the matter: "I am a proud supporter of the 'Cut, Cap and Balance' plan that includes a balanced budget amendment and that passed the House with a bi-partisan vote. If families and small businesses have to tighten their belts and balance their budgets, then government should do the same." Finally, we looked at statements of DeMint, a pivotal figure in the discussion. Shortly before announcing the SCF endorsement of Mandel, DeMint joined nine other Republican senators pledging their opposition to increasing the national debt limit unless Congress cuts spending, enforces spending caps and passes a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. He said he would not support any candidate who would not sign such a pledge. Asked in interviews if that did not make default likely, DeMint said on ABC: "We'll never default. If it's the last penny we have, we'll pay our bills." On NBC, he said, "It certainly will be disruptive if we continue on the track we're going right now," but he dismissed talk of default as "panic" stirred to force a deal: "We are not going to default. We've got enough tax revenue to pay our bills." Where does that leave us? The Ohio Democrats argue that failing to raise the debt limit will inevitably lead to default. And they say the SCF’s opposition to raising the debt ceiling, opposition the SCF says Mandel shares, amounts to an endorsement of default. But there’s some problems with that line of thinking. Opposition to raising the federal debt ceiling is not the same as actively endorsing the idea of the United States defaulting on its obligations. Protest votes opposing previous debt ceiling increases were common from both parties. But that doesn’t mean they were advocating default. No where in a list of policy goals the SCF has posted on its website is there any mention of support for default. And DeMint argues it won’t happen, describing talk of default as "panic" stirred to force a debt ceiling deal. Again, correct or incorrect, DeMint is not advocating default. DeMint himself has said he would support legislation to increase the debt ceiling if it followed provisions in his Cut-Cap-Balance Pledge; substantially cut current spending, cap future spending and require the passage of a strong Balanced Budget Amendment before raising the debt limit. Mandel has endorsed that plan. However unlikely it is that those provisions would gain passage in Congress, it’s far from endorsing default. But perhaps most importly, while declaring Mandel endorses default, the Ohio Democrats don’t rely on Mandel’s words at all. Their cited source was information DeMint and the SCF stated about Mandel. We find the Ohio Democratic Party’s claim isn’t just inaccurate, it’s also ridiculous. On the Truth-O-Meter there’s just one ruling for that kind of statement: Pants on Fire.

pomt-15307	"Texas’ high school graduation rate went from 27th in the country in 2002, to second highest in the country in 2013."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2015/jul/20/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-texas-shot-no-2-no-27-high-school-/	It hasn’t been long since we checked a Rick Perry claim about the schools in his home state. In June, we found Mostly True the former governor’s declaration that Texas has the second-highest high school graduation rate in the country and the highest graduation rate for African Americans and Hispanics. That was close to entirely right. Then after that, the second-time Republican presidential aspirant caught our interest when he said in a July 2, 2015, speech in Washington, D.C.: "Texas’ high school graduation rate went from 27th in the country in 2002, to second highest in the country in 2013." As we wrote before, Perry was off by a notch in that Texas in 2012-13 tied for third with Wisconsin for its 88 percent graduation rate, according to a February 2015 federal chart. And did Texas rocket past two dozen states from about a decade before? Hold that thought: To arrive at his claim, Perry did the statistical equivalent of mixing apples and artichokes. That is, the measurement he cited for the No. 27 ranking was not the same measurement used to arrive at Texas’ No. 3 ranking. The more recent ranking reflected each state’s four-year "adjusted cohort graduation rate," based on the "number of students who graduate in four years with a regular high school diploma divided by the number of students who form the adjusted cohort for the graduating class," according to the National Center for Education Statistics, which is part of the U.S. Department of Education. The center says the size of each potential graduating class was adjusted starting the first year of high school by adding students who subsequently transferred in and subtracting students who transferred out, moved to another country or who died as reported by each state. Put another way, if Perry had stuck with the indicator that landed Texas around 27th nationally in 2001-02, he would have ensured accuracy by saying Texas was tied with four states for 22nd in 2011-12, the latest year of available data. A factor in Perry doing otherwise, we speculate, is the metric landing Texas at No. 3 wasn’t universally applied until a few years ago. 2001-02 Our search for 2002 data started with an email to Perry campaign aides asking about the basis of his comparison; we fielded no reply. When we asked the Texas Education Agency about the state’s 2002 graduation rate, spokeswoman DeEtta Culbertson advised by email that the agency did not circulate state-by-state rankings at that time because accurate comparisons were believed to be hard to nail. In 2003, though, the Texas Legislature directed the department to "compute dropout rates and graduation rates consistent with federal standards and definitions," Culbertson said. Nationally, she said, a mandated graduation rate standard was put in place in 2008 in accord with the No Child Left Behind Act (which was approved by Congress in 2001). "It took some time for many states to develop the data collection and processing systems to calculate a rate based on four years of individual student-level data," Culbertson wrote. So, Texas in 2012-13 ranked near the top nationally in its graduation rate by a measure that wasn’t in place in 2002. Responding to our request for data covering earlier years, Culbertson noted that in 2002-03, the year after the one singled out by Perry, Texas ranked 29th nationally, tied with Indiana, for its 75.5 percent "averaged freshman graduation rate." New Jersey led the nation with an 87 percent rate. Those rates were calculated, according to the NCES, by dividing the number of high school students who graduated with a regular high school diploma that year by the average of three enrollments: Grade 8 enrollment five years earlier, Grade 9 enrollment four years earlier and Grade 10 enrollment three years earlier Our search of the center’s website led us to an October 2005 report showing averaged freshman graduation rates in 2001-02, Perry’s cited year. Texas then landed 28th among the states, we found, with a 73.5 percent rate. New Jersey led nationally with an 85.8 percent rate. The report’s introduction touched on how this measurement differs from those that track each student individually, stating that while the averaged freshman graduation rate is not as accurate, it "can be computed with currently available data." 2011-12 In 2011-12, the latest year of available data, Texas ranked 22nd nationally in its averaged freshman graduation rate, according to a center chart. The 82 percent rate tied the rates for California, Colorado, Illinois and Kentucky. Vermont and Nebraska tied for first with 93 percent rates. So by this gauge, Texas went from 28th nationally in 2002 to tied for 22nd in 2012. Misleading? We wondered if it mattered that Perry echoed rankings rooted in different calculations. To our inquiries, experts told us his statement was misleading. Grover Whitehurst, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, emailed: "Perry should have used the same measure to compare graduation rates across the years in question rather than one measure for the beginning year and another measure for the ending year. His statement is misleading." Whitehurst agreed the yardstick placing Texas third in 2012-13 wasn’t available in 2002. "It is quite possible to switch measures when discussing different points on the trend line, as the governor did, because of confusion rather than intentional cherry picking of the numbers that make the progress in Texas look best," he wrote. The NCES, he said, publishes "dueling statistics on graduation and completion rates in such a way that a casual reader can easily make the mistake of comparing incommensurate measures." By phone, Walt Haney, a retired Boston College professor, called Perry’s dual-method comparison "potentially extremely misleading. It’s based on different metrics." Haney said it would have been more meaningful to air the state’s rank in 2002 and 2012 by the been-around-longer "averaged freshman graduation rate" indicator. Likewise, Rob Warren, a University of Minnesota sociologist, said Perry tapped incompatible metrics. "On the only metric for which you have measurements over time, there has been little change," Warren said by email. "I infer that not much has changed." Broadly, Warren said by phone, he also doubts the averaged freshman graduation rate indicator delivers accurate state-to-state comparisons. He said that’s because each state has leeway to define what goes into the rate calculations. Of note, he said, is whether a state as a whole holds back a lot of ninth-grade students. If so, the related graduation rate calculation will distort actual results--to the detriment of the state’s standing. Perry’s claim misleads, Warren said, because the 2013 and 2002 percentages don’t measure the same thing. "So you may be higher on one, lower on the other, that doesn’t tell you which one is right. They have similar names, purport to measure similar things, but they’re not the same thing," he said. Our ruling Perry said: "Texas’ high school graduation rate went from 27th in the country in 2002, to 2nd highest in the country in 2013." Texas graduation rates improved while Perry was governor. But this comparison evidently jammed together results reached by different calculations--a statistical no-no leaving the misimpression that Texas galloped past many states on Perry’s watch. It looks to us like Texas actually moved from about 27th nationally in 2002 to tied for 22nd in 2012, according to a measure that compares graduates each year to tallies of students earlier enrolled in lower grades. By a newer gauge tied to tracking individual students, Texas in 2013 tied for third (not No. 2). We rate this claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-14689	"As governor of Florida, I used a combination of strategies to help reduce heroin use among youth in Florida by approximately 50 percent."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/13/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-governor-he-helped-reduce-youth-hero/	Addiction is a deeply personal issue for Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush, whose daughter Noelle suffered from addiction and a string of related criminal charges while he was serving as governor of Florida. In a Medium post on Jan. 5, 2016, Bush offered a glimpse into "the heartbreak of drug abuse" that his family had experienced, along with policy proposals to better address addiction. In the column, Bush discussed his record on drug policy during his gubernatorial tenure. "As governor of Florida, I used a combination of strategies to help reduce heroin use among youth in Florida by approximately 50 percent," Bush wrote. Bush took office in January 1999 and left in January 2007. We took a closer look into that statistic. (A few days later, Bush turned Noelle's story into a television ad.) The Bush campaign pointed us to the 2006 Florida Youth Substance Abuse Survey conducted by the Florida Department of Children and Families. (Although several surveys of drug use are released on an annual basis, experts told us that this is the only survey that would speak to the specific numerical claim Bush made.) For heroin use, the survey offers two measurements -- heroin use at any time of one’s life, and heroin use during the past 30 days. For the first category -- use of heroin in one’s lifetime -- 2.2 percent of respondents between the ages of 11 and 18 had used it in 2000, compared to 1.1 percent in 2006. That’s a 50 percent decrease. And for the second category -- heroin use in the past 30 days -- 0.8 percent reported using it in 2000, compared to 0.4 percent in 2006. That’s also down by 50 percent. So numerically, Bush has a point. Still, experts said it’s worth taking those numbers with a grain of salt. Testing the numbers One concern is that the percentage of youth using heroin is small, meaning the differences from year to year are small -- and this makes them potentially unreliable. Indeed, the report itself cautions, "Heroin use in a school population is extremely rare. Nationally, no lifetime prevalence rate for heroin has exceeded 2.4 percent in the 8th, 10th or 12th grades in the past decade. … Given the extremely low prevalence rates associated with heroin use by Florida students, analyses that attempt to precisely specify or quantify changes over time are subject to error." In addition, for both measurements, the biggest drop came between 2000 and 2001, with minimal changes between 2002 and 2006. That seemed curious to Lloyd Johnston, a senior research scientist at the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research and principal investigator of the Monitoring the Future study, which tracks drug use in the United States. "While that is possible, I don't think it very plausible," Johnston said. "Rates almost always change more gradually." One possible explanation for that pattern, he said, is that the 2000 survey collected its data in December and January, whereas the 2001 to 2005 surveys conducted their data in April and May of those years. A further curiosity, Johnston said, is that one would not expect a one-year decline that steep for lifetime heroin use. From year to year, the pool of respondents is mostly the same. In the first year, the survey includes youth who are 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18 years of age. The following year, the 18-year-olds drop out and a new group of 11-year-olds joins, but all the other groups are included again. With such modest changes from year to year in the makeup of the age groups, one would not expect a large change in heroin use over a lifetime from one year to the next, Johnston said. "That makes the lifetime improvement in 2001 highly implausible," Johnston said, adding that a sizable change in the 30-day-rates would be more plausible. What was Bush’s role? There’s also a separate issue: Did Bush’s policies help engineer this decline? That’s hard to say, though drug-policy experts in Florida do praise Bush for his work on the issue. James Hall, a drug abuse epidemiologist at Nova Southeastern University, said that Bush gave the issue high priority, including the creation of a drug policy office out of his own office to coordinate law enforcement, treatment, education and prevention. The office -- which was later eliminated by Gov. Rick Scott -- made a "very significant contribution" to drug policy in the state, Hall said. In addition, Bush championed community-based anti-drug coalitions that helped consolidate prevention efforts, Hall said. And his wife Columba was also active in drug- and alcohol-abuse issues, he added. Still, such efforts likely had a "marginal influence" on heroin-use rates, Hall said. Often, broader issues such as demographic and social trends have a bigger impact. Indeed, it’s worth noting that heroin use among youth was declining nationally during roughly the same period. Johnston’s own study found that heroin use among youth was declining nationally between 1999 and 2007, the full extent of Bush's term in office. "For the three grades we study (eighth, 10th, and 12th), the combined prevalence of heroin use during the prior 12 months declined from 1.3 percent in 1999 to 0.8 percent in 2007," he said. That’s a drop of about 40 percent -- not far from what the Florida-only survey found. Our ruling Bush said that "as governor of Florida, I used a combination of strategies to help reduce heroin use among youth in Florida by approximately 50 percent." The only statistics that directly address his statement offer numeric support. However, the report in question cautions against drawing broad conclusions for such low-frequency events as youth heroin addiction, and experts thought it curious that the drop essentially happened in the first year, with little change after that. Experts praise Bush for his drug policies, but it’s important to note that broader demographic and social factors -- reflected in falling youth heroin use nationally during that period -- likely made a difference as well. We rate the claim Half True.	None	Jeb Bush	None	None	None	2016-01-13T16:03:19	2016-01-04	['Florida']
pomt-08523	Says Roy Blunt "secretly inserts language to benefit tobacco giant Philip Morris" into a national security bill while "Blunt's girlfriend and son are lobbyists for the cigarette company, and just days earlier, 26 Philip Morris executives wrote checks to Blunt totaling $23,000."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/05/commonsense-ten/commonsense-ten-ad-accuses-roy-blunt-secretly-inse/	An independent group called Commonsense Ten has begun airing attack ads in several key Senate races including Missouri, where they have come after Rep. Roy Blunt with a potent cocktail, accusing Blunt of trying to push through pro-tobacco legislation while dating a Philip Morris lobbyist and cashing campaign checks from Philip Morris executives. Commonsense Ten, led by several Democratic strategists, sets the stage with a time/date stamp at the beginning of the ad: U.S. Capitol, Washington D.C., Nov. 13, 2002. And then the conspiratorial-sounding voice-over: "A critical national security bill is up for a vote. Just hours before, Roy Blunt secretly inserts language to benefit tobacco giant Philip Morris. Blunt's girlfriend and son are lobbyists for the cigarette company, and just days earlier, 26 Philip Morris executives wrote checks to Blunt totaling $23,000." Republican Blunt's Democratic opponent Robin Carnahan included a similar allegation in one of her ads, stating, "Congressman Roy Blunt. He got caught trying to insert a secret deal for tobacco giant Philip Morris into a bill just days after company executives gave him $30,000." The Commonsense Ten version scores an attack-ad trifecta. Big tobacco. Girlfriend and son lobbying for said big tobacco. And pay-to-play. But is it accurate? Let's start with the stuff in the ad that's not contested, or at least is well-documented. Back in November 2002, Blunt was dating Abigail Perlman, who was at that time a lobbyist for Philip Morris (and whom Blunt would later marry). Blunt's son, Andrew, was a lobbyist for Philip Morris in Missouri (not a federal lobbyist). And records show that Blunt got the donations cited in the ad from Philip Morris executives. Now, to the contested part, whether Blunt secretly inserted language in a national security bill to benefit tobacco giant Philip Morris. It's an allegation that originated with a June 11, 2003 story in the Washington Post. The Washington Post cited several unnamed sources who alleged Blunt -- just named the new majority whip -- "surprised his fellow top Republicans by trying to quietly insert a provision benefiting Philip Morris USA into the 475-page bill creating a Department of Homeland Security." The story went on, "Once alerted to the provision, Speaker J. Dennis Hastert's chief of staff, Scott Palmer, quickly had it pulled out, said a senior GOP leader who requested anonymity. Majority Leader Tom DeLay, R-Tex., also opposed what Blunt (Mo.) was trying to do, the member said, and 'worked against it' when he learned of it." According to the Post, "the provision would have made it harder to sell tobacco products over the Internet and would have cracked down on the sale of contraband cigarettes, two practices that cut into Philip Morris's profits." Groups like the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids opposed the Blunt provision at the time, arguing it had less to do with national security, which Blunt's office said was its intention, and more to do with protecting American cigarette companies. Among other things, they argued that while cracking down on cigarette smugglers, it also would have prevented U.S. tobacco companies from being sued by foreign governments which charged them with intentionally supporting international cigarette smuggling to avoid duties and taxes. The Post story quoted a "senior Republican lawmaker who requested anonymity" saying "some GOP members worried at the time that it would be 'embarrassing' to the party and its new whip if details of the effort were made public." According to the story, "Another Republican said Blunt's effort angered some leaders because there was 'so little support for' a pro-tobacco provision likely to generate controversy." Then, as now, Blunt defended the provision as good policy and a bona fide homeland security issue. Blunt spokesman Rich Chrismer told us in an e-mail, "The provision Roy Blunt and members of the House leadership supported would have cracked down on the illegal sale of contraband cigarettes to fund terrorist activities. Bipartisan legislation, originally sponsored by Democratic Senator Herb Kohl and Congressman Anthony Weiner, passed overwhelmingly in both bodies and is now the law of the land." Chrismer cited news accounts that documented the growing concern among federal law enforcement officials that smugglers were using millions of dollars acquired from illegal cigarette sales and funneling the cash to organizations such as al Qaeda and Hezbollah. Chrismer also forwarded a letter former Majority Leader Dick Armey wrote to Blunt on July 21, 2004: "I have been reading a lot about the anti-terrorism provision that you and others wanted to include in the homeland security bill in November 2002, and I wanted to correct the record on a few circumstances surrounding that effort." Armey wrote that he "not only agreed with the provision, but understood the Senate would be supportive." "I recall that the Speaker's office was concerned that the Judiciary Committee had not yet thoroughly reviewed the provision by means of committee hearings and markup," Armey wrote. "He did not want a jurisdictional fight on his hands, and it is his job to manage those issues. But, since then, the Judiciary Committee has held hearings and approved a freestanding bill to crack down on illegal sales of cigarettes and eliminate a source of funding for terrorist groups. "The effort you and I supported has great momentum now," Armey stated, "and I am tired of reading stories that only tell half the truth." But the provision proposed by Blunt was not identical to the later Kohl/Weiner bill referenced by Blunt spokesman Chrismer, which ultimately passed. The Kohl/Weiner legislation was similar, in that it sought to address Internet cigarette sales and other contraband trafficking of tobacco products. But there was nothing in that bill about blocking foreign governments from bringing lawsuits against U.S. tobacco companies in U.S. courts for their involvement in tobacco tax evasion or related contraband trafficking. That's the part of Blunt's provision that groups like the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids opposed. In fact, the Campaign strongly supported the later, bipartisan legislation. According to a 2003 press release from the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, "The problem of contraband and Internet sales of tobacco products is a serious one that Congress should address. But the approach advocated by Philip Morris and Rep. Blunt is narrowly written to protect only Philip Morris’ commercial interests and not the broader public health or state government interests involved." Allegations of "secretly inserting" provisions into bills are often a matter of interpretation. In this case, hours before a final vote on the Homeland Security Bill, Blunt proposed a provision that had not been vetted in a committee meeting or in legislative markup sessions. It may have been added in a way that meant there was little notice and little discussion, but that doesn't necessarily add up to "secretly." Blunt may argue the provision was a legitimate homeland security concern and that a similar version later received bipartisan support. But the Blunt provision was opposed by some anti-tobacco groups, who viewed it as special interest legislation to benefit big tobacco. And we note that those groups did not oppose the later legislation. When you date (and later marry) a Philip Morris lobbyist, when you have a son who works as a tobacco lobbyist, when you accept hefty sums of campaign money from tobacco executives, and then you add an 11th hour provision that some view as pro-big tobacco, you leave yourself open to the kind of criticism raised in the ad. "Secretly" may be overstating how Blunt acted, but the ad's other points are backed up, so we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-00439	On conservative mega-donor Richard Uihlein.	full flop	/wisconsin/statements/2018/aug/23/leah-vukmir/flip-flop-leah-vukmir-accused-donor-trying-buy-us-/	In the space of nine days, Leah Vukmir went from condemning Richard Uihlein’s campaign cash to essentially soliciting it. Seem like a flip-flop? Unwrap the Flip-O-Meter, which we use to rate a person’s consistency on an issue — in this case, Vukmir’s position toward Uihlein, the conservative mega-donor. Who is Uihlein? Uihlein, an Illinois resident, is a founder of Uline Corp., a shipping and packaging supply company based in Pleasant Prairie, Wis., near the Illinois border. If anyone could almost single-handedly make political newcomer Kevin Nicholson into a viable candidate for the U.S. Senate, it was Uihlein. All of our fact checks in the U.S. Senate race. Nicholson ultimately lost to Vukmir, a longtime state lawmaker, in the Aug. 14, 2018 Republican primary for the right to take on the incumbent, Wisconsin Democrat Tammy Baldwin, in the fall. But he took the fight to Vukmir -- in no small part because of spending by Uihlein. Groups supported by Uihlein spent nearly $11 million in support of Nicholson and against his rival, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported several days before the primary. For example, the Uihlein-backed group Solutions for Wisconsin made a $911,000 television buy in the final days. What Vukmir said about him Now, to what Vukmir has said about Uihlein — the contrasting statements having been pointed out in an Associated Press news article. Aug. 6, 2018: "Try to buy" Eight days before the primary, Vukmir was salty toward Uihlein. "I think it leaves a bad taste in the mouth of a lot of people that a particular out-of-state donor is spending as much money as he is to, in essence, almost try to buy a Senate seat, and that’s not what Wisconsin politics is about," Vukmir told Green Bay conservative radio talk show John Muir, in a clear reference to Uihlein. That Vukmir remark echoed criticism from Democrats, who 10 months earlier were complaining that Uihlein was trying to buy the seat for Nicholson. Aug. 15, 2018: "Reaching out" The day after her primary win, however, Vukmir was conciliatory. "We are already reaching out to Dick Uihlein and I hope that he will want to continue with his commitment," Vukmir said to conservative Milwaukee radio talk show host Mark Belling. "Let’s face it, he wants to defeat Tammy Baldwin. And so I will look forward to having that conversation with him," Vukmir added, noting she would be attending a unity dinner two days later co-hosted by Uihlein. Our rating The Flip-O-Meter has three ratings: No Flip – No significant change in position. Half Flip – A partial change in position. Full Flop – A complete change in position. In this case, Vukmir went from condemning Uihlein’s campaign contributions to essentially soliciting them. It may be understandable, given Uihlein’s resources, that Vukmir would decide to seek his support. But it’s also a Full Flop.

pomt-01064	"If you ask how many times did Ronald Reagan attend a fundraiser when he ran for re-election in 1984, the answer is eight times. If you say how many times did Barack Obama attend a fundraiser in 2012, the answer is 228 times."	mostly true	/new-hampshire/statements/2015/jan/20/lawrence-lessig/lawrence-lessig-compares-number-fundraisers-betwee/	Harvard professor Lawrence Lessig has recently been making a frigid, 150-mile walk through New Hampshire to promote campaign finance reform. Lessig, the founder of the crowdfunded Mayday PAC -- known as the super-PAC to end all super-PACs -- kicked off the 10-day march in the tiny Northern New Hampshire town of Dixville Notch, known for its midnight ballot box voting during the "first in the nation" primary. His walk will take him and dozens others to the state capitol in Concord by Jan. 21. In a visit to the Concord Monitor before starting the walk, Lessig offered a striking comparison showing how the role of money in politics has changed over the years. To Lessig, fundraising has become a primary focus for today’s politicians, at the expense of governing. "If you ask how many times did Ronald Reagan attend a fundraiser when he ran for re-election in 1984, the answer is eight times. If you say how many times did Barack Obama attend a fundraiser in 2012, the answer is 228 times," Lessig told the Monitor. He continued, "And you think, how does a man, as a person, run the nation when he's attending 228 fundraisers? And the answer is not very well. It's pretty terrible for your ability to do your job. It's pretty terrible for your ability to be responsive to the American people, because -- let me tell you -- the American people are not attending 228 fundraisers. Those people are different." It’s no secret that truckloads of dollars are raised and spent in presidential elections, but PolitiFact New Hampshire wondered whether Lessig’s specific comparison between Reagan and Obama was accurate. Lessig isn’t the first to make the comparison between Reagan and Obama on fundraising; similar statistics have surfaced in various media reports. These comparisons track back to a distinction in campaign financing that we’ll recap here. The story begins in 1972, the year of President Richard Nixon’s re-election campaign. (Yes, the one that led to the Watergate scandal.) That year, the Nixon re-election campaign collected millions of dollars in illegal campaign contributions. After Nixon’s resignation, Congress passed (and Nixon’s successor as president, Gerald Ford, signed into law) changes to the Federal Election Campaign Act. Once enacted, presidential candidates were able to receive a partial federal match for money they raised for the primary, up to $5 million. And for the general election, candidates could secure full federal funding -- up to $20 million -- as long as they raised no private money for the general election and stuck to expenditure limits. That system prevailed for the better part of three decades. However, in recent presidential campaign cycles, the system began to break down due to a combination of court decisions and changes in how presidential campaigns prefer to operate. An arms-race style competition between the parties has left any candidate who accepts the restrictions tied to federal funding at a severe disadvantage, since candidates can easily raise more private money than the federal allotment, without the strings attached. Obama is one of those politicians. He was the first president since Nixon to be elected with only private money. And to give some perspective on the amount of money we’re talking about, more than $2 billion was raised and spent in the last presidential election between Obama and Mitt Romney. When we contacted Lessig to see where he was getting his data comparing Obama to Reagan, he pointed to a presentation by Fred Wertheimer, a lawyer and founder of Democracy 21, a group that advocates curbing the influence of big money in American politics. In his presentation -- made at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School in October, 2012 -- Wertheimer said the system for public financing of presidential elections, which emerged in the wake of the Watergate scandal, is broken. Reagan used the public financing system for his campaign in 1984 and did not have a primary opponent, eliminating his need to raise money during the primary and general election. Reagan "ran for re-election without holding a single campaign fundraiser," reported Washington Post national political editor Dan Eggen in a 2012 article, "Post-Watergate campaign finance limits undercut by changes." "If he attended fundraisers, they must have been for the party or for other GOP candidates," concurred Viveca Novak, the editorial and communications director at the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks money raised by politicians running for federal offices. Lessig later pointed to an article in the Baltimore Sun by Brendan Doherty -- a political science professor at the U.S. Naval Academy and author of the book, The Rise of the President’s Permanent Campaign. Doherty counted 220 fundraisers for the Obama Victory Fund, compared to just three fundraisers "headlined" by Ronald Reagan during his third and fourth years in office, leading up to his re-election. Doherty doesn’t break down the fundraisers year by year, and instead uses a campaign cycle, which usually spans two calendar years. His numbers match those cited by USA Today, which reported on Aug. 12, 2012, that Obama had attended his 200th fundraiser since filing for re-election in the spring of 2011. Obama attended five fundraisers in one day in Chicago, including one at which guests paid $40,000 per ticket, according to the newspaper. Doherty counted the fundraisers by using the public papers of the presidents of the United States, presidential libraries and Lexis-Nexis searches of Associated Press articles. "My numbers are a bit different from the trend you cite, but (the) shift from Reagan to Obama in terms of time spent fundraising has been dramatic," Doherty told the Monitor. All told, Reagan received about $40 million in public financing during his campaign -- while Obama raised more than $715 million in private funds. With the demise of the public financing system and looser rules on raising and spending money, said Novak of the Center for Responsive Politics, "fundraising is unfortunately a bigger part of the process than ever before," Novak said. Our ruling Lessig said Reagan attended eight fundraisers in 1984, while Obama attended 228 in the 2012 cycle. We couldn’t replicate his exact numbers, but they jibe with reports by experts and the logic of how the public- and private-financing systems work. There’s certainly little doubt about Lessig’s larger point -- that there’s been a sea change in spending on presidential elections during the past 30 years. On balance, we rate Lessig’s claim Mostly True.	None	Lawrence Lessig	None	None	None	2015-01-20T17:30:09	2015-01-05	['Ronald_Reagan', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-06252	"At a minimum, 40 percent of those who view child pornography end up molesting children as a result."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2011/nov/30/mike-dewine/mike-dewine-cites-link-between-viewing-child-porno/	There is no category of crimes more revolting to most people than sexual crimes committed against children. In the wake of the Penn State scandal, Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine rolled out a new "Crimes Against Children" initiative on Nov. 18 targeting Internet predators who trade child pornography or actually molest or attempt to molest children. Flanked by police chiefs and prosecutors, DeWine announced that he was dedicating a new 15-person unit to focus on stopping crimes against children. The unit would be part of the state Bureau of Criminal Investigation, which is run by his office. Attempting to demonstrate the prevalence of the crimes in today’s society, DeWine focused on the link between viewers of child pornography and the actual molestation of children. "At a minimum, 40 percent of those who view child pornography end up molesting children as a result," DeWine said. "At least 40 percent, some estimates as high as 80 percent." PolitiFact Ohio was struck by the relatively high percentage cited by DeWine and the cause and effect he said exists between viewing child porn and committing physical acts of sexual contact against children. Could four in 10 people who viewed child porn really be committing sexual acts against children? We turned first to DeWine’s office for some supporting evidence, who quickly e-mailed us a pair of studies said to back up his claim. The first study, entitled "A Profile of Pedophilia: Definition, Characteristics of Offenders, Recidivism, Treatment Outcomes, and Forensic Issues, is from doctors at the Mayo Clinic. It states that 30 to 80 percent of arrested individuals who viewed child pornography and 76 percent of individuals who were arrested for Internet child pornography had molested a child, according to studies and case reports. The study quotes from a November 2004 article from the American Prosecutors Research Institute called "From Fantasy to Reality: The Link Between Viewing Child Pornography and Molesting Children" written by Candice Kim. It also apparently references a 2000 study of sex offender inmates in a Federal Bureau of Prisons program. Kim’s report cites a U.S. Postal Inspection Service finding that 80 percent of purchasers of child pornography are active abusers and nearly 40 percent of the child pornographers investigated over several years have sexually molested children. A footnote indicates the statement is taken from the 2002 testimony Ernie Allen, director of The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, when he appeared before a congressional committee. The U.S. Postal Inspection Service made 1,807 child porn arrests from January 1997 to March 2004 which netted 620 "confirmed child molesters," the article states. That is a child molestor rate of 34.3 percent, according to the statistic provided by U.S. Postal Inspection Service Agent Ray Smith during a 2004 interview with Kim. Other statistics found in the report include a Pennsylvania-based law enforcement task force reporting that 51 percent of individuals arrested for pornography-related offense were also determined to be actively molesting children or to have molested in the past. In Dallas, a similar task force put that figure at 31 percent. The original source of those statements was again Allen’s 2002 congressional testimony. The other study cited by DeWine’s office is a 2005 study funded by a congressional grant to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. In that study of 1,713 people arrested nationwide for child pornography in a one-year period from July 2000 to July 2001, 40 percent were "dual offenders" who sexually victimized children and possessed child pornography with both crimes discovered in the same investigation. So what are all these studies saying? They are saying there is a link between those arrested by various state and federal law enforcement agencies for child porn possession and acts of molestation of children by this same group of people. What the do not say, though, is that the link exists for the entire group of people that views child porn and whether those people molest children. As the 2005 National Center for Missing & Exploited Children report puts it "we do not know if these child porn possessors were representative of all Internet-related child porn possessors." Furthermore, that report states that there is no known evidence supporting cause and effect -- that simply possessing child pornography encourages or causes child victimization. There has been no study of this issue. "Knowing a considerable number of dual offenders were discovered during investigations of Internet-related, child-sexual victimization and child porn possession cases does not explain how possessing child pornography is related to child victimization or whether it encourages or causes such victimization," states the report. "We do not have data to determine this." Later, the report states as to whether the child porn viewing is done before the molesting "we had no information about the sequencing of crimes committed by dual offenders." Meanwhile, a 2000 study done by psychologists working with prisoners in the Federal Bureau of Prisons sex offender treatment program found that 76 percent of inmates charged with child pornography crimes admitted to having committed contact sex crimes. That study was followed up in 2009 by a similar study which found that 85 percent of 155 convicted sex offenders had committed at least one "hands on sexual offense." However, a paper prepared by one of the primary authors of both studies, Andres Hernandez, stresses not to apply the statistics of those convicted of child porn possession to the larger "unknown" population of child porn users. "The number of individuals who are apprehended by law enforcement for committing child porn offenses represents a small proportion of the population of individuals collecting, trading and producing child pornography worldwide," Hernandez writes. "Some individuals have misused the results (of the two studies) to fuel the argument that the majority of child porn offenders are indeed contact sexual offenders and, therefore, dangerous predators. This is simply not supported by the scientific evidence." Said Hernandez’s paper: "Some individuals in law enforcement are tempted to rely on a biased interpretation of our study...to prove that the majority of child porn offenders are child molestors." Hernandez’s paper also notes something not reported in this 2009 study — that a 42-person sample of the prisoners were asked questions about when they began possessing child porn compared to when they began committing contact sexual crimes. "The vast majority of our subjects indicated they committed hands-on abuse prior to seeking child pornography via the Internet," he writes. "The results indicated that in 41 of 42 cases examined hands-on sexual crimes preceded child porn offenses." So where are we left as we bid this abhorrent subject goodbye? At a news conference promoting a crackdown on sexual crimes against children, DeWine made statements stating that "at a minimum 40 percent of those who view child pornography end up molesting children as a result." Molestation crimes are horrific. And while DeWine’s statement is overly broad, it does contain an element of truth: that people who commit acts of child molestation also often view child pornography. His statements are based on studies which are all of those arrested for child porn offenses and range from a 31 percent child molester rate up to 85 percent, depending on the study. However, several of the authors of those studies caution that the numbers should not be generalized to the bigger universe of all people who have viewed child porn -- those who have been arrested and those who have not. And that’s exactly what DeWine did. And researchers caution that there is no evidence that the molesting of children by those possessing child porn takes place as a result of viewing the child porn, a claim made by DeWine. Quite to the contrary, study of this cause-effect relationship we found suggests that nearly all offenders committed acts of molestation prior to looking at child porn. Those are critical facts that would give a different impression of DeWine’s claim. On the Truth-O-Meter, his claim rates Mostly False.

pomt-05828	Says critics called the original GI Bill "welfare."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2012/feb/17/lawrence-odonnell/lawrence-odonnell-says-critics-called-original-gi-/	In a promotional spot for his MSNBC program, Lawrence O’Donnell speaks proudly of his father attending college on the post-World War II benefits package that transformed the nation. O’Donnell further says of the original GI Bill: "It’s the most successful educational program that we’ve ever had in this country -- and the critics called it welfare." They did? Austin lawyer Terral Smith, a former Republican member of the Texas House, urged us to check this after seeing the ad in January. After asking MSNBC to elaborate, we looked for authoritative recaps of how the far-reaching law came to be. President Franklin Roosevelt signed the Servicemen’s Readjustment Act, the "GI Bill of Rights," into law in June 1944, according to the Veterans Administration’s online history of the agency. Broadly, the history says, the act provided millions of veterans with up to four years of education or training, plus a monthly subsistence allowance; offered them federally guaranteed home, farm and business loans with no down payment; and provided for unemployment compensation of $20 weekly for up to 52 weeks for veterans who had served 90 days or more. The VA’s web post is silent on the act’s progress through Congress -- and any related criticism. Next, we turned to the American Legion’s online post of a 1949 article by a Washington reporter, David Camelon, recapping the law’s roots. This story says the American Legion drafted the proposal in 1943 and lobbied for it the first part of 1944 -- surprisingly drawing early opposition from other veterans groups, including the Disabled American Veterans. According to the article, that group’s representative, Millard Rice, sent a Feb. 22, 1944, letter to Walter George, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, objecting to the proposed unemployment benefits. Rice’s letter said, in part: "The lazy and 'chisely' types of veterans would get the most benefits, whereas the resourceful, industrious and conscientious veterans would get the least benefits, if any." The article says Rice and others assumed too many veterans would idle for the 52 weeks of unemployment payments. Despite such critiques, a revised version of the proposal shortly won unanimous Senate approval, according to the article. In the House, though, Rep. John Rankin, chairman of its committee for veterans affairs, had misgivings about the unemployment compensation element. In his 2009 book, "Beyond the Bonus March and GI Bill," Stephen Ortiz, an assistant professor of history at Binghamton University, says Rankin "viewed the educational features (of the GI Bill) with skepticism, believing that only a small percentage of already privileged veterans would take advantage of them. Moreover, he treated the unemployment features with outright disdain. An ardent white supremacist, Rankin feared the unemployment provision’s impact on the work habits of the African Americans in his state and region. African Americans would not quickly rejoin the work force, he argued, if they were being paid generous unemployment benefits. Rankin complained further that it would ‘spoil’ them." In a telephone interview, Ortiz told us that no critics called the GI Bill "welfare," but some admirers later considered the law a welcome step toward the United States becoming more of a social-welfare state. Back to our timeline: House committee members sent their version of the legislation to the House, which gave unanimous approval in May 1944, the American Legion story says. A House-Senate conference committee convened to iron out differences between the bodies. By early June 1944, its members had resolved many provisions though, the article says, they broke down seemingly over which agency would oversee veteran job placements, a standoff that the article calls a camouflage for continued uncertainty over the measure’s 52-20 unemployment compensation feature. The impasse ultimately cleared after a Georgia member of the conference panel flew in overnight to vote for the compromise, the story says. By email, MSNBC spokeswoman Lauren Skowronski sent us two batches of excerpts, some attributed to members of Congress as quoted in the 1944 Congressional Record. Many of the excerpts covered objections noted in the American Legion magazine article. A memo from Melissa Ryerson, a producer of O’Donnell’s program, says some lawmakers and critics also fretted over the GI Bill’s "broad" education provisions. The memo also suggests that objections mentioning "relief" or "the dole" were equivalent to modern-day references to welfare. "If Mr. O’Donnell had used the word ‘relief’ instead of ‘welfare’" in the advertisement, the memo says, "no one would have understood what he meant." A sampling of MSNBC’s excerpts: -- Comments from Rep. Rankin about fearing a "tremendous inducement to certain elements to try to get employment compensation. It is going to be very easy… to induce these people to get on federal relief." Another Rankin comment, suggesting the proposal would reward those who delayed seeking work: "The bane of the British Empire has been the dole system." He also aired a racist comment, saying: "If every white serviceman in Mississippi… could read this so-called GI Bill, I don’t believe there would be one in 20 who would approve of it... We have 50,000 Negroes in the service from our state and in, in my opinion, if the bill should pass in its present form, a vast majority of them would remain unemployed for at least another year, and a great many white men would do the same." -- A 1950 Saturday Evening Post article stating: "The education and training section of the GI Bill became, in reality, a relief act or a bonus act… more than 15 million veterans [were still] entitled to an average of 40 months of schooling at government expense, including subsistence." --A comment attributed to Robert Maynard Hutchins, president of the University of Chicago from 1929 to 1951: "Colleges and universities will find themselves converted into educational hobo jungles… [The GI Bill] is a threat to American education [and] education is not a device for coping with mass unemployment." We spotted the same comment in a November 2004 commentary on the GI Bill’s origin by writers Paul Dickson and Thomas B. Allen. Before quoting Hutchins’ "hobo jungle" warning, the commentary says: "Racist politicians opposed provisions of the bill that would ‘put money in the pockets of black vets’ and some elitist educators opposed higher education as a benefit." By 1956, the commentary says, the law had helped to produce 450,000 engineers, 238,000 teachers, 91,000 scientists, 67,000 doctors, 22,000 dentists, and more than 1 million other college-trained men and women. Also, it says, 11 million of 13 million houses built in the 1950s were financed with GI Bill loans. Ortiz and Nancy Beck Young, a University of Houston historian who has studied the legislative history of the GI Bill, each told us it would be incorrect to say critics called the proposal welfare. Beck Young told us in a telephone interview that members of Congress were intent on ensuring returning troops did not face the fate of World War I veterans, some of whom marched on Washington only to be ignored and then mistreated. While there were concerns about the unemployment provisions and the measure's overall cost, she said, they "did not call it welfare. The (congressional) debates were about fine-tuning. Everybody realized something that had to be done; something generous." Beck Young cautioned against "cherry-picked research. It’s not right to say they called it welfare." Our ruling We found no evidence of critics referring to the GI Bill as welfare. Yet some fretted that the law’s unemployment compensation element would encourage laziness. We see a touch of truth to O’Donnell’s claim, which we rate Mostly False.	None	Lawrence O'Donnell	None	None	None	2012-02-17T13:03:26	2012-01-31	['None']
pomt-01062	"Today, home sales are up nearly 50 percent from where they were in the worst of the crisis."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/20/barack-obama/home-sales-are-nearly-50-percent-worst-housing-cri/	President Barack Obama is touting the apparent success of his policy decisions in speeches, telling a crowd in Phoenix that his actions have led to a rebound in the housing market. At a speech at Central High School on Jan. 8, 2015, Obama said programs to stop people from losing their homes and to help move homeless veterans off the streets has led to tangible economic benefits. "So as a result of all these efforts, today, home sales are up nearly 50 percent from where they were in the worst of the crisis." PolitiFact wondered if home sales had really jumped that much, or if Obama was just selling us a line. Tour of homes We contacted the White House, which said they used two sets of data to formulate this claim. One is new home sales, the measure of newly constructed houses as measured by the Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Commerce. The other is existing home sales, which is compiled by the National Association of Realtors. The two are tracked by separate entities because new home sales involve measuring other economic indicators, as well, like construction jobs and materials. The numbers the White House provided were measured like this: They took the average of the last six months of available data (ending November 2014, in this case) and compared it to the lowest point in sales for both kinds of sales. Those low points were in different months for each type of sale (February 2011 for new home sales and July 2010 for existing home sales). The census data an Obama spokesperson provided matched what we found independently, but existing home sales data are a little trickier. The National Association of Realtors splits that into two groups, single-family homes and condos or co-ops. The White House supplied single-family home numbers only, but NAR spokesperson Adam DeSanctis said the best measure is to combine both, because that gives a better overall picture, so we looked at it that way, too. Because we don’t want to make your head spin from all these digits, we’ll chart it out for you: Sale type June-November 2014 average Low point during recession Percent change New home sales 432,000 270,000 (February 2011) + 60 percent Existing home sales (single-family homes only) 4.49 million 3.06 million (July 2010) + 47 percent Existing home sales (single-family homes + condos and co-ops) 5.096 million 3.45 million (July 2010) + 48 percent For reference, this is approaching a return to more normal transaction numbers, because sales were grossly inflated during the housing bubble. Sales of new homes reached a peak of almost 1.4 million in July 2005, while existing home sales topped out at 7.26 million in September 2005, before the bubble finally burst around 2008. Obama said "nearly 50 percent," so he could be talking about simply existing home sales, but the White House supplied us with both. We can’t simply average out the two different percentages because they cover different time periods, but both have recovered considerably. Beyond an upswing in sales, reports from real estate data firms RealtyTrac and Core Logic show foreclosure filings (things like default notices, bank repossessions and scheduled auctions) in 2014 were down more than 60 percent from their 2010 high of 2.87 million, back to pre-recession levels. That’s not to say the housing market is necessarily robust, either. Harvard University’s Joint Center for Housing Studies said in its latest State of the Nation’s Housing report that new single-family housing starts are still depressed, and existing home inventories are constrained. Households that pay an excessive portion of their incomes to live in their property remain near historical highs, as well. In any case, the approximation of the rebound in the national market is accurate, although one expert told us it still doesn’t paint the clearest picture of the economic recovery. "While encouraging, national numbers mask the uneven nature of the housing recovery," said Geoff Smith, executive director of the Institute for Housing Studies at DePaul University. "In many towns and neighborhoods the legacy of the crisis is strong, and these areas continue to struggle with weak demand, underwater homeowners and high levels of vacancy and abandonment." Debbie Goldstein, executive vice president at consumer protection group the Center for Responsible Lending, credits the Obama administration for pushing several policy positions that helped prospective homebuyers secure loans, and helped delinquent homeowners refinance. She said the Home Affordable Refinance Program that started in 2009 saved many homeowners from defaulting on their mortgages. She also said more recent underwriting rules will help lenders and buyers avoid some problems that led to the housing crisis. But she also said Washington could have done more, such as reducing principal for underwater homeowners, helping more first-time homebuyers get into the market and improve lending access to minorities. Plus, Congress could always roll back the underwriting rules and change everything. Our ruling Obama said, "Today, home sales are up nearly 50 percent from where they were in the worst of the crisis." That number matches census data for new home sales, although the White House said they also based the claim on existing home sales, which have increased by about 60 percent over the lowest point during the recession.

pomt-02741	"About 40 percent of workers don’t ... have a single paid sick day."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2013/dec/17/vicki-shabo/about-40-percent-workers-dont-even-have-single-pai/	Panelists on MSNBC’s The Cycle chewed on the topic of mandatory paid leave -- and how it isn’t a thing for all American workers -- on the heels of new legislation from Democrats that would create a program to make it happen. The Family and Medical Insurance Leave (FAMILY) Act, sponsored by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., and Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., would allow workers to take up to 12 weeks of paid family and sick leave through the creation of a trust fund, administered by the Social Security Administration, that would be funded by contributions from employers and employees of 0.2 percent of earnings (2 cents per $10). One big supporter is the National Partnership for Women and Families, which was very involved in the passage of the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act of 1993 that guaranteed 12 weeks of unpaid leave for most workers. Now, the group is pushing for the law to go even further so that more workers can take off -- and be paid -- during emergencies. America is far behind the modern world in the area of paid leave, said Cycle guest Vicki Shabo, director of work and family programs at the National Partnership for Women and Families, on Dec. 12, 2013. "About 40 percent of workers don’t even have a single paid sick day," Shabo said, "much less the long-term leave that the FAMILY Act would provide." We wondered if her statistic was accurate. Her source: the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ 2013 National Compensation Survey. The data show 61 percent of all private-sector workers were offered paid sick leave, leaving about 40 percent without it. The BLS count for public and private workers, excluding those who are self-employed or work for the federal government, is a tad higher at 65 percent. State and local government workers have a much higher rate of getting paid sick leave compared to other sectors, at about 89 percent. Employees of smaller firms and the leisure and hospitality sector are the least likely to have paid medical leave, the survey shows. The rate of paid sick leave increases with pay level, with the rise of white-collar jobs being the main reason that more workers have access to paid sick leave than 20 years ago. Under current law, workers are eligible for 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave per year for reasons that include childbirth, caring for a spouse, child or parent with a serious health issue, dealing with a serious health problem of their own, among others. According to the Department of Labor, nearly 60 percent of workers are eligible for unpaid leave through the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act of 1993, and 13 percent reported taking leave under FMLA in the past year. The Gillibrand-DeLauro proposal would provide leave to every worker, including those who work for smaller employers or are self-employed or unemployed, "as long as the person has sufficient earnings and work history," according to a DeLauro press release. The idea is modeled after programs in California and New Jersey. Payments to employees on leave would be equal up to 66 percent of monthly income, capped at a monthly amount. We checked in with the conservative Employment Policies Institute, which opposes pro-labor policies. Research director Michael Saltsman said Shabo's statistic, while accurately sourced, does not account for workers given a pool of hours to use for vacation, illness or personal reasons. Widening the scope shows 77 percent of private-sector workers receive paid vacation time, he said, referencing the BLS. "Of course, that makes the statistic appear far less 'shocking' than Shabo would like it to be," Saltsman said. Consolidated leave plans, which offer employees a block of leave time per year to use for various reasons, are becoming more popular for American workers, particularly those in the insurance and health care sectors, according to the BLS. The BLS found 26 percent of all workers were offered consolidated leave plans in 2012. Our ruling Shabo accurately referenced 2013 federal data when she said, "About 40 percent of workers don’t even have a single paid sick day." Saltsman did offer one caveat, however, noting that some workers have a pool of days that can be used for illness or vacation. That caveat is enough to rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-01051	Starting in December 2007, "1.4 million jobs were created in Texas. In that same period, the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2015/jan/22/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-texas-gained-million-jobs-while-re/	Rick Perry reminded lawmakers in his last speech to them before ending more than a decade as governor that he’s proud of Texas job gains on his watch — and the rest of the country lost jobs in recent years, he said. "I have been guided by a simple philosophy: That job creation, not higher taxation, is the best form of revenue generation," Perry said in his Jan. 15, 2015, speech. "And we have created jobs. In the last year, we have created 441,000 jobs. Since I became governor, with your help, we have created almost one-third of all the nation’s new jobs." Those figures hold up if you get your wording straight. We found True Perry’s past claim to Texas’ accounting for one third of net new jobs in the country. As we checked this latest statement, analyst David Cooper of the liberal Economic Policy Institute crunched the latest federal figures and told us Texas jobs accounted for 27 percent of the net jobs gained in the 43 states that gained jobs since 2000. "Still pretty impressive," Cooper said by phone. In his speech, Perry added accurately: "The unemployment rate in Texas is significantly below the national average. And right here in Austin, Texas, it’s below 4 percentage points." Then Perry said: "In fact, if you look at the last seven years…starting in December of 2007, you will see that 1.4 million jobs were created in Texas. In that same period, the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs." That much of a Texas/Not-Texas gulf? By email, Perry spokesman Felix Browne pointed out U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics figures for Texas and other states and encouraged us to consult Mark J. Perry, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and professor of economics and finance at the University of Michigan campus in Flint. Professor Perry wrote in a November 2014 online commentary that from December 2007, the start of the national recession, through October 2014, Texas saw civilian employment balloon by 1.36 million jobs. "In contrast," he wrote, "civilian employment in the other 49 states without Texas is still 0.26% and more than 350,000 jobs below the December 2007 level … — there were 134.9 million non-Texas jobs in October vs. 135.26 million in December 2007." To our query, the scholar emailed a chart showing that based on what the government calls "total employment," covering all jobs including self-employed posts, Texas had 1,410,400 more jobs in November 2014 than it had in December 2007 while the rest of the country had 352,440 fewer jobs. Total employment, he said, serves as a comprehensive indicator and is used to calculate unemployment rates. Mark Perry said the likely reason the latest figures weren’t perfectly echoed in the governor’s speech is the BLS recently revised upward U.S. jobs for November 2014, which had the effect of reducing the number of jobs lost outside of Texas in the cited period. A little more: The BLS says the definition of employment in the federal household survey, which the governor relied on for his comparison, "comprises wage and salary workers (including domestics and other private household workers), self-employed persons and unpaid workers who worked 15 hours or more during the reference week in family-operated enterprises. Employment in both agricultural and nonagricultural industries is included." In contrast, the government's oft-quoted payroll survey of employers "covers only wage and salary employees on the payrolls of nonfarm establishments." Cooper of EPI commented to us that the timeframe singled out by the governor may deliver a more glowing contrast for Texas than other periods. According to the government’s payroll surveys, he said, the country has added 9.1 million jobs since June 2009, the acknowledged end of the national recession, with Texas accounting for 1.5 million of the additions. Significantly, he said, the rest of the country as a whole lost jobs from June 2009 until February 2010. Since then, he said, the U.S. has added more than 10 million jobs with Texas (again) accounting for more than 1 million of them. Professor Perry said that in his view, the best comparison of Texas to the rest of the nation starts in December 2007. His point: "Texas never experienced significant job losses during the Great Recession, while the rest of the country did," he emailed. "Therefore, comparing job gains since June 2009 or Feb. 2010 really won’t make much sense. Of course the non-Texas US gained a lot of jobs since June 2009, and more than Texas, but that’s because Texas never lost any (very many) jobs in 2008 and 2009 like the rest of the country. Texas is a great economic success story, and an anomaly vs. the rest of the country regarding job losses/gains," he wrote. Separately, we asked a Dallas-based analyst about the governor’s claim. Cheryl Abbot of the BLS said by email the claim could have been precise by referring to "total civilian employment" rather than jobs. That said, as of November 2014, Abbot said, 24 other states had yet to reach pre-recession employment levels. "On a statewide basis, Texas by far leads all states, with total civilian employment growth of 1,410,440. California is a distant second with civilian (household) employment growth of 452,763," Abbot wrote. Our ruling Gov. Perry said that starting in December 2007, "1.4 million jobs were created in Texas. In that same period, the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs." His figures mostly hold up according to household surveys by the federal government looking into civilian employment including self-employment, though positions not yet recovered outside Texas totaled closer to 350,000, according to the latest available data when Perry spoke.

pomt-07858	When the Milwaukee County mental health facility is full, "cops sit out there in their squad cars with a mentally ill patient" and sometimes "spend an entire shift out there doing that."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/10/jim-sullivan/milwaukee-county-executive-candidate-jim-sullivan-/	During a two-month period in 2004, more than 60 people with mental health emergencies waited for up to 60 hours to get treatment at the Milwaukee County Mental Health Complex. Some had to be kept under police guard until they could receive care. In early 2008, police agencies continued to rack up thousands of dollars in overtime as officers waited in their squad cars or in hospital emergency rooms with patients who needed psychiatric crisis services. According to Jim Sullivan, one of the five candidates running in the Feb. 15, 2011, primary election for Milwaukee County executive, the problem persists. In a Jan. 31, 2011 meeting with Milwaukee Journal Sentinel editors and reporters, Sullivan responded to a question about the Mental Health Complex by saying: "When they’re full up over there, our local police officers -- if you’ve got somebody who needs to be over at mental health because they’re mentally ill, they may pose a danger to themselves, any of these different things -- if it’s full, cops sit out there in their squad cars with a mentally ill patient in the back and they have to wait to unload and people will, in some cases, spend an entire shift out there doing that." If Sullivan is right, police officers are regularly experiencing hours-long delays at the Mental Health Complex when transporting someone who needs crisis services. Is he right? We asked Sullivan, a former Democratic state senator from Wauwatosa, the basis for his statement. He did not have any direct evidence, but said he heard the Wauwatosa and West Allis police departments experienced such waits. Thousands of people each year receive crisis care at the complex, 9455 W. Watertown Plank Road. Some are admitted to the 96-bed facility but most are treated and released. As Sullivan indicated, crisis patients are brought to the facility, often by police, because they are deemed a danger to themselves or others. The Journal Sentinel’s Patients in Peril investigation has uncovered numerous problems at the complex, from bungled care of patients and staff members falsifying documents to skyrocketing overtime costs. But delays faced by police officers transporting crisis patients have not been in the news recently. What’s more, Sullivan’s claim about delays is contradicted by an October 2010 study by a national consulting firm, which found that changes made by the county "have been very effective in reducing backups." The finding was reiterated by the Milwaukee-based Public Policy Forum research organization in a January 2011 report, which summarized issues for candidates in the county executive race. That report relied, in part, on a November 2010 county memo that showed a dramatic reduction in police waits beginning in 2008. To further check Sullivan’s statement, we contacted the two police departments he cited as well as the Milwaukee Police Department and the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office. Here is what they told us: Wauwatosa police: Long delays ended five or more years ago and current wait times are usually less than 30 minutes, said Capt. Jeff Sutter. "It would be extremely unusual for us to have what I consider a long wait," he said. West Allis police: Long waits ended three years ago, according to Chief Mike Jungbluth, who said his officers transport patients to the Mental Health Complex "every day." Milwaukee police: "We aren’t experiencing the issue anymore," said spokeswoman Anne E. Schwartz. Milwaukee County sheriff: Deputies usually wait about 20 minutes, said Capt. Darlene Jonas. If several officers are trying to get patients treated, the wait time could be one to two hours, she said. So what’s the bottom line? Sullivan said delays in admitting people to the Mental Health Complex for crisis care can be so long that police officers spend up to an entire shift with patients waiting for them to receive treatment. Hours-long delays were a problem some years ago. But the four largest police agencies in the county now say waits are short. Perhaps there are isolated cases today in which officers waits for hours, but at minimum Sullivan’s claim is clearly dated. We rate it False.

pomt-06667	The Wisconsin Department of Corrections is considering implementing mandatory physical fitness testing for security staff.	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2011/sep/10/chain-email/email-claims-physical-fitness-tests-will-be-requir/	A fake story purporting to be from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s website got thousands of workers at the state’s Department of Corrections buzzing. And then re-buzzing. Some 10,000 employees of the state agency that oversees prisons received an email on Sept. 6, 2011, that included a "story" with the byline of Jason Stein, a reporter in the newspaper’s Madison Bureau. It looked like a JSOnline story, down to the same font and similar layout. The headline: "Dept. of Corrections considering yearly physical fitness testing." The item went on to say the department was considering new testing for "security staff" beyond what’s administered when they are hired. It even included a fake quotes from the department’s actual spokeswoman, Linda Eggert. All of this would no doubt come as a surprise for state employees. Many are already anxious about their jobs in the wake of a new state law pushed by Gov. Scott Walker greatly limiting collective bargaining for most public workers. And there are fitness tests at the time someone is hired. An applicant must clear a number of hurdles -- including a fitness test that consists of push-ups, sit-ups and a run. The standards vary depending on the age and gender of the applicant. So, an authentic-looking story could well get them wondering: Are regular push-up tests coming for prison guards already on the job? There’s only one problem. The story wasn’t published by JSOnline.com and the Corrections Department says the claims in it aren’t true. It’s another email hoax. Because so many people receive chain emails, PolitiFact checks them out. PolitiFact’s national site has evaluated 100 chain emails. Of the claims, 28 were rated False and 51 were rated Pants on Fire. Some of them are items such as one claiming the federal government is going to make you get rid of your light bulbs next year (Pants on Fire). Or that members of Congress and their families are exempt from repaying student loans (likewise). At PolitiFact Wisconsin, we looked at a chain email that -- also using a fake JSOnline story -- said Walker had hired convicted Assembly Speaker Scott Jensen to oversee a raid on the state employee retirement system to help balance the state budget. That email wound up, briefly, on a teachers union website in Little Chute before the hoax was revealed. We rated it Pants on Fire. Anyone sensing a trend? As for the new email, the agency first heard about it the morning of Sept. 6, 2011, when an employee from the Prairie du Chien prison contacted administrators in Madison, said Department of Corrections spokesman Tim Le Monds. That afternoon, the agency sent an email to all employees trying to set the record straight. "Enclosed is a ‘report’ that some of you may have received or seen. I want you to know that this report is false and has no merit or truth to it whatsoever," wrote corrections secretary Gary Hamblin. "No one from the Secretary’s Office had a discussion about this topic with any reporter nor is the issue of physical fitness testing being considered." Hamblin tried to close the door on this issue. But the fake story was pasted into his email which suggested it had actually been published. On Sept. 7, 2011, the secretary’s office tried again. "To further clarify, neither the Journal Sentinel nor any of its reporter/s was involved in any way in the creation of the ‘report’ enclosed in the message," wrote Eggert. The department does not know where the fake email originated and there are no plans to track down the source of the email. "It’s a waste of time," Le Monds said. Our conclusion A fake JSOnline.com was emailed around the Department of Corrections saying that prison guards could face fitness testing. The story was never published. And the department says there are no plans for such tests. Pants on Fire.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2011-09-10T09:00:00	2011-09-06	['None']
pomt-03814	In 2008, "only 54 percent of Latinos in Texas were registered to vote and only 35 percent actually turned out."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2013/mar/22/battleground-texas/battleground-texas-says-54-percent-texas-latinos-r/	A pro-Democratic group says demographic changes and stepped-up voter turnout in Texas will lead to Democrats winning statewide sooner than later. On Comedy Central’s Feb. 26, 2013, "Colbert Report," Jeremy Bird, senior adviser to the newly announced Battleground Texas group, was asked if his mention of demographics was a liberal euphemism for more Hispanic and black residents. Bird replied: "If you look at the state, it’s not just about the demographics, it’s about the turnout. So in 2008, for example, only 54 percent of Latinos in Texas were registered to vote and only 35 percent actually turned out. So what you’re getting is, when only about 50 percent of the population turns out to vote in a place like Texas, you’re getting a government in Texas that’s for half the people and by half the people." We’re not wading in on that logic, nor are we getting into potential strengths or weaknesses of stirring citizens to vote who have historically not voted. We wondered instead if 54 percent of Latino Texans registered to vote in 2008, as Bird said, and 35 percent turned out, especially considering that no one marks down their race or ethnicity when they register to vote. Depending on estimates Antonio Gonzalez, president of the Los Angeles-based William C. Velasquez Institute, which says it conducts research aimed at improving the level of political and economic participation in Latino and other underrepresented communities, told us by telephone that there is no perfect way to pinpoint the makeup of any electorate. But for decades in even-numbered years, he said, the U.S. Census Bureau has followed up general elections by surveying residents about voting habits. He said he respects the surveys’ results, though they include some inflated responses. "It’s the government asking if you’ve voted or registered to vote," Gonzalez said. "So there’s an (unquantified) exaggeration factor." Alternatively, Gonzalez said, campaigns target Latinos after identifying them by surnames on state voter rolls. There are quirks here too: Voters who go by non-Latino last names tend to be missed and others who marry into Latino families might be miscounted. Also, he said, firms taking this approach depend on surname dictionaries that vary in quality. All told, 60 percent of more than 13.5 million Texas voters turned out for the 2008 presidential election, according to the Texas secretary of state’s office. Latinos made up 20 percent of the state’s November vote, according to voter exit polls, with 63 percent favoring Democrat Barack Obama for president and 35 percent backing Republican John McCain, who otherwise carried the state like every GOP presidential nominee since 1980. How Battleground Texas calculated When we asked Battleground Texas for backup on Bird’s figures, we heard from several individuals employed by or contracting with 270 to Win, a political consulting firm with offices in Washington, D.C., and Chicago. Lynda Tran, a partner at the firm, pointed out the Census Bureau survey taken after the 2008 general election. According to that survey, 54.3 percent of Latino Texas citizens 18 and older--an estimated 2.4 million of its estimated nearly 4.5 million Hispanic citizens in the state--said they registered to vote, with a margin of error of three percentage points. Nearly 1.7 million, or about 70 percent, of the Latino registered voters also said they voted, according to the survey, accounting for 37.8 percent of the state’s adult Hispanic citizens as estimated by the survey. This result had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.9 percentage points, making Bird’s declared 35 percent in range. Andrew Claster, a number-cruncher for the cause, said later by email that Bird drew his reference to 54 percent of Latino citizens registering to vote from the bureau’s post-election survey estimates. But he said the conclusion that 35 percent of Latino citizens voted was developed by estimating the number of Latino voters, 1,340,097, a figure reached by applying a "commercial ethnicity model" to the state’s 2008 voter file to determine ethnicity based on name and census information. Claster said the voter estimate was then divided by a 2008 bureau estimate of the number of Latino Texas citizens, 3,812,343, which did not come from the post-election survey. That estimate of voting-age Latino citizens runs some 700,000 less than the estimate of nearly 4.5 million reached via the bureau’s post-election survey. We asked why the group used one census study for one statistic and relied on another for the second. Claster replied that whichever estimate one chooses for the number of adult Latino Texas citizens, it appears that some 30 percent to 38 percent of those citizens voted, either way reinforcing Bird’s point. Other looks at Latino registration, turnout Three other analyses, developed in Texas, enabled us to reach our own statistical speculations. Compared to the post-election census survey, the other estimates suggest more Latinos registered to vote, but fewer turned out in November. Each of the calculations was based on identifying Spanish-surnamed voters on the state's 2008 voter roll. Republican pollster Mike Baselice of Austin and the Texas Tribune, teaming with the El Paso Times, each estimated that there were some 2.9 million Spanish-surnamed Texas registered voters that year. Democratic pollster Jeff Smith of Austin told us by email that his audit of the voter roll, teasing out Latino voters based both on Spanish surnames and maiden names and also removing voters whose names were at least temporarily struck from the roll before the November election, indicates 2,713,681 Hispanic citizens registered to vote. Baselice and the Tribune/Times concluded that about 1.3 million Texas Latinos voted that year. That’s 400,000 fewer than indicated by the census survey. In contrast, Smith estimated that 1,382,360 Latinos voted. Summing up: The 2008 census survey suggests Texas had some 300,000 to 500,000 fewer Latinos registered to vote than the voter-roll analyses by the Texas outfits. The census survey indicates, too, that there were up to 400,000 more Latinos who voted than estimated by the other analyses. Baselice and Smith each said he did not try to gauge the number of Latino citizens who could have registered to vote nor did the Tribune air an estimate. Time for a little math of our own. We used the Texas analyses to stab at the share of voting-age Latino citizens who registered to vote. We did this by dividing each of the other estimates of Latinos who registered to vote by the census bureau’s survey estimate that there were 4,493,000 voting-age Latino citizens in 2008. By our calculations, 60 percent to 65 percent of voting-age Latinos registered that year, more than the 54 percent suggested by the census survey and echoed by Bird. Next, we divided the Texas-devised estimates of Latinos who voted by the census survey’s estimate of 4,493,000 voting-age Latino Texas citizens, a methodology that suggests 29 percent to 31 percent of voting-age Latlnos turned out in November--a bit under the 35 percent figure aired by Bird. Footnote: Census Bureau spokesman Robert Bernstein told us results from the bureau’s 2012 post-election voting surveys were not finalized. Our ruling The Battleground Texas advocate said that in 2008, "only 54 percent of Latinos in Texas were registered to vote and only 35 percent actually turned out." Research rooted in federal surveys and an analysis starting from the state's 2008 voting roll supports those figures, while our own estimates starting from Texas studies suggest a larger share of voting-age Latino citizens registered and a smaller share of them voted--which, if so, could still be fodder for pushes to improve participation. We rate this claim as Mostly True.	None	Battleground Texas	None	None	None	2013-03-22T10:00:00	2013-02-26	['Texas']
pomt-05498	Says opponent Ted Cruz has not led businesses.	true	/texas/statements/2012/apr/16/tom-leppert/tom-leppert-says-ted-cruz-has-not-led-businesses/	Businessman and former Dallas Mayor Tom Leppert says fellow candidate Ted Cruz, a Houston lawyer, has a meaningful gap in his background. During the April 13, 2012, Republican U.S. Senate debate at WFAA-TV in Dallas, Cruz asked Leppert to comment on another candidate’s position on wage taxes. Leppert didn’t go there, instead replying: "The reality of it is that you have been a terrific staffer in the attorney general’s office. But the reality of it is you haven’t led businesses. So when you start talking about these issues, on how they impact business, to you it’s really an academic exercise. To me, it’s a career." Has Cruz never led a business? In a telephone interview, Leppert spokesman Daniel Keylin told us that Leppert based his claim on Cruz’s biography as presented on Cruz’s campaign website. Cruz says in the site’s biographical section that he is now a partner at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP in Houston, where he "leads the firm’s U.S. Supreme Court and national appellate litigation practice." From 2003 to 2008, the section says, Cruz was the state’s solicitor general, leading state government’s legal appeals before state and federal courts, including the Supreme Court. (Cruz was appointed to the post by Attorney General Greg Abbott, the state’s chief lawyer.) From 2004 to 2009, the entry says, Cruz also taught U.S. Supreme Court litigation as an adjunct professor of law at the University of Texas School of Law. And before that, the entry indicates, he held back-to-back federal posts and helped George W. Bush run for president. "Prior to serving as solicitor general, Ted served as the director of the Office of Policy Planning at the Federal Trade Commission," Cruz’s entry says. He earlier was "an associate deputy attorney general at the U.S. Department of Justice," according to the entry, after serving as "domestic policy advisor on the 2000 Bush-Cheney campaign. "In addition, Ted clerked for Chief Justice William Rehnquist on the U.S. Supreme Court," the entry says. We asked Cruz’s campaign if Leppert’s claim about his not leading any businesses holds up. Spokesman James Bernsen pointed to Cruz’s campaign biography. We rate Leppert’s claim as True.	None	Tom Leppert	None	None	None	2012-04-16T14:09:19	2012-04-13	['Ted_Cruz']
pomt-03976	On his definition of "takers" and "makers"	full flop	/wisconsin/statements/2013/feb/13/paul-ryan/has-ryan-remained-consistent-talking-about-what-h-/	In the 2012 presidential campaign and for years before that, Paul Ryan warned that a culture of European-style dependency on government programs had created as many "takers" as "makers" in American society -- or even a majority of "takers." So when President Barack Obama in his second inaugural address proclaimed that Social Security and Medicare strengthen America rather than make it a "nation of takers," many saw it as a swipe at Ryan. Ryan blasted Obama’s words as misleading. Republicans, he said, had not meant to include elderly recipients of Social Security and Medicare as "takers." Those folks, Ryan said, helped earn their retirement benefits through payroll taxes deducted from their paychecks specifically for those programs. Ryan critics in the media labeled it a reversal and an attempt to soften the GOP rhetoric on fiscal issues. But Ryan insisted the position didn’t change, though Obama’s words created another impression. Has Ryan’s position remained the same? Or has the 2012 Republican vice-presidential candidate altered it as the GOP repositions itself following a painful defeat in the presidential race? With Ryan a possible presidential candidate in 2016, we thought we’d roll out the Flip-O-Meter. Our standard note: The Flip-O-Meter does not measure whether a change is good politics or good policy, only whether a politician has been consistent. So, what about those "takers" and "makers"? We’re not sure who introduced the terms into the political debate, but Ryan helped popularize them, notably after a 2009 report by the business-backed Tax Foundation on the redistribution of federal tax dollars and spending. That report categorized Americans by whether they had received more in federal benefits than they had paid in various federal taxes, though it used the gentler terminology of "givers" and "receivers." The study, cited frequently by Ryan, calculated that 60 percent of families were net receivers and projected the figure would rise to 70 percent under Obama’s policies. It is important to note that Medicare and Social Security benefits were included in the Tax Foundation calculation. The report, and subsequent ones that borrow from it, make clear that "all federal spending" is covered. The studies also make clear that taxes people pay toward those programs were included on the other side of the ledger. Enter Ryan, who picked up the 2009 report’s conclusion in support of his argument that America was at or near a "moral tipping point" and already at a fiscal crossroads. His warnings were sometimes dire, and based explicitly on the Tax Foundation report. In a 2010 interview on a cable show hosted by U.S. Rep. Walter Jones (R-North Carolina), Ryan promoted his debt-reduction plan, including gradually reducing Social Security benefits for younger Americans and replacing Medicare’s guaranteed health benefits with vouchers to help buy private coverage. Those big entitlement programs "are exploding our debt" in a way that threatens the U.S. economy, Ryan said. He told Jones: "Right now, about 60 percent of the American people get more benefits in dollar value from the federal government than they pay back in taxes. So we’re going to a majority of takers vs. makers in America and that will be tough to come back from that." Ryan repeated the point with conservative political activist Star Parker in September 2011. "Right now according to the Tax Foundation, between 60 and 70 percent of Americans get more benefits from the federal government than they pay back in taxes," he said. "So we’re getting toward a society where we have a net majority of takers vs. makers, who, if that trend continues, then we’ll have a European situation on our hands. Campaigning in August 2012, just days before officially joining the presidential ticket with Mitt Romney, Ryan told a MacIver Institute interviewer: "We risk hitting a tipping point in our society where we have more takers than makers in society, where we will have turned our safety net into a hammock that lulls able bodied people into lives of dependency and complacency which drains them of their will and incentive to make the most of their lives." Obama, Ryan said, wrongly portrays Republicans as favoring a "dog eat dog" society. They actually want a safety net that provides "equality of opportunity, not equality of outcome," he said. Ryan avoided the "takers" and "makers" line -- and references to the Tax Foundation study -- after his August 2012 selection as the veep nominee. It was a hot topic, though, after a video surfaced of Romney’s remarks that 47 percent of Americans are content to be dependent on government, and they support Obama. In a campaign interview with the Journal Sentinel, Ryan blamed Obama and the bad economy for increasing dependency, and said people were not dependent by choice. Also during the 2012 campaign, Ryan pulled back from his 2005 description of Social Security as a socialist-based "welfare transfer" and "collectivist system" that was too costly and should be converted to a system of individual accounts that workers could invest as they wished. Let’s look now at Ryan’s post-election comments. Two days after Obama’s inaugural jab at those who call Social Security and Medicare recipients "takers," Ryan told a conservative talk show host that Obama had used a "twist of terms to try and shadowbox a straw man in order to win an argument by default." "No one is suggesting what we call our earned entitlements -- entitlements you pay for, like payroll taxes for Medicare and Social Security -- are putting you in a taker category," Ryan said on the Laura Ingraham radio show. "No one suggests that whatsoever." Ryan said his primary concern was welfare programs of the sort Washington reformed in the 1990s. That change was under President Bill Clinton, eliminating the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program in favor assistance tied to work. Ryan’s comments on the show were the first instance we could find of him separating Medicare and Social Security from what he calls the "takers." We asked Ryan’s office if there any instances before the election in which he made the distinction between the retirement programs and "takers." The office did not provide any. Instead, they pointed us to comments he made after the inaugural to Journal Sentinel reporters and editors, in which Ryan noted that Social Security helped him go to college after his father died. Ryan also said he didn’t think of his mother, who is on Medicare, as a taker. In those interviews, Ryan argued that he had only used the Tax Foundation figure of 60 to 70 percent as a device to highlight his larger point that it’s not too late yet to reverse course because not all takers see themselves that way. That’s accurate to a point. In some instances he made the larger point by citing surveys showing only 30 percent of Americans favor a welfare state. But in several interviews his point was simply the need to cut the budget to prevent the 60 percent "takers" figure from growing. But here we’re looking at how Ryan defined "takers" before the election and whether it changed after the election. We found no record of Ryan prior to the election spelling out, program by program, which federal benefits would cause him to view a recipient as a "taker." Rather, he took an all-in approach. Ryan labeled all recipients of federal benefits that way, elevating numbers buried in a think-tank report to the statistical centerpiece of his budget-cutting message over a period of years. Indeed, his warnings about dependency were made all the more dramatic because the numbers he cited were so large -- in part because they included the entitlement programs. Had Ryan taken out the big entitlement programs the number would have been lower, said Gerald Prante, the former Tax Foundation economist who devised the methodology used in the paper. In our view, by distancing himself from his prior, broad denunciation of "takers" in connection with all federal benefits, Ryan’s post-election approach has changed dramatically. That’s true both on the key point of how retirement benefits should be viewed, and in the style of his presentation. A major reversal earns him a Full Flop.

pomt-04942	Says Donna Campbell is pushing a 35 percent sales tax extending to medicine, groceries and real estate.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2012/jul/27/jeff-wentworth/jeff-wentworth-says-donna-campbell-pushing-35-perc/	State Sen. Jeff Wentworth of San Antonio says his opponent in a July 31, 2012, Republican primary runoff has a hankering to hike taxes. A Wentworth campaign mailer tells residents of the Austin-to-San Antonio Senate district: "Don’t be tricked: Donna Campbell," his New Braunfels runoff opponent, "is pushing a 35% national-state-local sales tax on medicine, healthcare, groceries, water and real estate!" Another Wentworth mailer presents her as saying: "Texas needs a 35% sales tax on groceries, medicine, healthcare, water and ALL purchases." And a July 18, 2012, news article in the San Marcos Daily Record quotes Wentworth as saying: "My opponent's call for a 35 percent sales tax in Texas on medicine, groceries, water, real estate and all purchases is absurd." A refresher: The existing state sales tax of 6.25 percent applies to retail sales, leases and rentals of most goods plus 17 categories of taxable services including Internet access and security services. Also, Texas cities, counties, transit authorities and special-purpose districts have the option of imposing an additional local sales tax for a combined total of state and local taxes of 8.25 percent. Many items -- including water, groceries and medicine -- are exempted from the sales tax. So, Wentworth is saying that Campbell both wants to more than quintuple the state sales tax rate and start applying the tax to some essential items. One hitch for us in starting this fact-check was the absence of any public sign that Campbell has been campaigning for a 35 percent state-federal-local sales tax. Any such proposal goes unmentioned on her campaign website, where she says she will work to decrease taxation. Asked how Wentworth unearthed his opponent’s double-digit tax-hike push, Wentworth’s consultant, Bryan Eppstein, pointed out that while Campbell was running for the U.S. House in 2010, Austin’s KVUE-TV quoted her as advocating the replacement of federal income taxes with a 23 percent federal sales tax on consumer goods and services, a position then pointed out by her Democratic opponent, U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett. An online version of the Oct. 29, 2010, KVUE news story quotes Campbell as saying: "Income tax, payroll tax, you wouldn’t pay any of that" under the approach. "If it’s a retail tax, and you buy something new you’d pay 23 percent," she said. Eppstein further pointed out that an official with the right-leaning Texas Public Policy Foundation, Talmadge Heflin, testified afresh in May 2012 in favor of the state wiping out property taxes and making up the lost revenue with changes in the sales tax. He said that based on Heflin’s testimony, Wentworth concluded that Campbell favors a state sales tax rate of 12 percent. Heflin, a former chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, hearkened in his testimony to an April 2009 foundation report stating that revenue generated by property taxes could be replaced by money raised from the sales tax by setting the rate at 12.5 percent if the existing tax is extended to property sales or, he said, 9 percent if the tax is extended to property sales as well as all services that are taxed in at least one other state. The report says that if the sales tax is not expanded to additional items or services, its rate would need to be around 14.5 percent to raise revenues lost by eliminating property taxes statewide. Eppstein also noted that Campbell has the endorsement of Texans for Fiscal Responsibility, a group that asked candidates seeking its support to fill out its 2012 candidate questionnaire, including questions about phasing out property taxes in return for raising sales taxes. One question on the survey refers to "end-user consumption taxes," meaning sales taxes. The questions says: "Would you support moving Texas away from property taxes in favor of the existing sales and use tax?" Candidates are asked to support or oppose. The question is followed by this text: "Note: Tax swaps, phase-outs or trade-offs are not considered tax increases unless the total tax burden is increased." Next on the questionnaire: "Statement: Texas should phase out property taxes in favor of end-user consumption taxes." Candidates are asked to agree or disagree. By email, Campbell spokesman Jon Oliver said that Campbell replied on the questionnaire that she supports moving Texas away from property taxes to the existing sales tax and also agreed that Texas should phase out property taxes in favor of end-user consumption taxes. But, Oliver said, in order to have Campbell’s support, a proposal to replace property taxes with sales taxes would have to lower the overall tax burden for Texas families and businesses; be limited to taxing items currently covered by the sales tax; be phased in gradually; and win voter approval at the polls. Earlier, Oliver said by email: "She is intrigued by the overall idea of a consumption tax instead of a property tax if it would truly lower the tax burden, but it's not part of her platform and she certainly wouldn't support a state sales tax in the form Sen.Wentworth has claimed she would -- that is, taxing items that are currently exempt." Oliver noted, too, that Campbell has signed three pledges disavowing higher taxes: the Americans for Prosperity Taxpayer Pledge in favor of requiring voter or legislative supermajority approval for tax and spending increases; Gov. Rick Perry’s "budget compact" pledge to oppose any new taxes or tax increase; and one to taxpayers, advocated by Texans for Fiscal Responsibility, stating she "will oppose and vote against any and all efforts to increase taxes." We circled back to Eppstein, asking for evidence of Campbell talking up a 35-percent sales tax. By telephone, Eppstein said he has heard Campbell indicate as much, but did not record it. Our ruling Wentworth says Campbell is pushing a 35 percent sales tax extending to medicine, groceries and real estate. She’s not, though we can see the threads behind this misleading claim. While running for Congress in 2010, Campbell spoke out in favor of a possible 23 percent federal sales tax in return for wiping out federal income taxes. In the same spirit, she now supports replacing property tax revenue collected across Texas with income from the state sales tax. By itself, that move could drive the state sales tax rate to 14 percent or so. Then again, the conditions her campaign lays out could be taken as signals she’s not ready to embrace any sudden surge or broadening of the tax. Campbell’s two stances, taken years apart in campaigns for different offices, reflect on sales taxes at different levels of government.This claim distorts both positions by effectively combining the possible tax rates. All told, too, it’s ridiculous to assert that Campbell, who has signed no-new-tax pledges, is pushing or calling for an expanded sales tax set at 35 percent. Pants on Fire!

pomt-14522	Says Dontre Hamilton, who was killed during a confrontation with a Milwaukee police officer, was "unarmed."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/feb/18/hillary-clinton/black-man-was-unarmed-when-shot-dead-white-milwauk/	The disproportionate incarceration of black males was posed by a Facebook user during the Feb. 11, 2016 Democratic presidential debate, which was hosted by PBS in Milwaukee. U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders responded to the question first. When former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton followed, she made a claim about the 2014 death of a black man at the hands of a white Milwaukee police officer that we want to check. Clinton, after alluding to a statistic cited by the questioner, said: "And we know of the tragic, terrible event that led to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee. A young man, unarmed, who should still be with us. His family certainly believes that. And so do I." The key word in Clinton’s claim, of course, is unarmed. We found this to be one of the more difficult claims we have rated. Moments before he was shot to death by the officer, Hamilton had taken the officer’s baton and struck the officer with it. But Hamilton, who was mentally ill, had no weapon when he was rousted by the officer shortly after two other officers had allowed Hamilton to continue sleeping in a park. In that sense, Hamilton was armed only after he had been struck. Sequence of events Diagnosed with schizophrenia, Hamilton, 31, was described as having long suffered from mental illness, including making a suicide attempt the year before his death. He had a history of encounters with Milwaukee police, but no convictions for any violent crimes. Hamilton was shot to death April 30, 2014 after police were called to Red Arrow Park in downtown Milwaukee. Here’s an overview of the incident, based on a report by Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm. Chisholm’s report was based on an investigation done by a division of the Madison-based Wisconsin Department of Justice and a review by Emanuel Kapelsohn of the Peregrine Corp. in Pennsylvania, whom Chisholm cited as a leading national expert in use-of-force reviews. First police contacts: Shortly before 2 p.m., an employee of the Starbucks located at Red Arrow Park called police about Hamilton, who was sleeping in the park. The call was classified as a "welfare check" -- in other words, to check if Hamilton was OK. A desk sergeant called downtown officer Christopher Manney’s cell phone and left a voicemail message, saying he wanted Manney to go to the park about "a homeless guy sleeping" there. Manney, a 38-year-old, 13-year veteran of the department, was working another call downtown. Because he didn’t immediately respond to the voicemail, the Starbucks call was referred to a dispatcher, who then dispatched two other officers to the park. They found Hamilton lying on his back with his eyes closed. They nudged Hamilton, he got up and provided identification; he said he was taking a nap and was all right. The officers left, since Hamilton was not disturbing anyone, according to the report. About 2:10 p.m., another call to police about Hamilton came from Starbucks. The two officers went to Starbucks and told the employees Hamilton was not doing anything wrong. The officers left shortly before 3 p.m. So, at this point, police had no concerns that Hamilton was armed or dangerous. Manney responds: Just before 3:30 p.m., Manney listened to the voicemail. He called dispatch and asked if there was an assignment for Red Arrow Park. Told there was not, Manney asked, according to the report, "that he be recorded as responding to a trouble with subject" call, and he went to the park. He apparently was not aware the other officers had preceded him. Manney approached Hamilton, who was lying down, helped him up and then began to pat him down. Hamilton resisted. Witnesses told police that Manney, who was yelling commands at Hamilton, struck Hamilton one or more times with his baton before Hamilton took the baton and struck Manney with it one or more times, according to the report. The witnesses said Hamilton was holding the baton -- one said menacingly -- when Manney fired his service weapon. It was determined that Manney fired the gun 14 times, resulting in 15 gunshot wounds to Hamilton. So, Hamilton had no weapon when Manney approached him. He was armed, with Manney’s baton, only after Manney struck him with the baton. It’s worth noting that Flynn said, when he later fired Manney, that "officer-created jeopardy is a term that has real meaning in the training circles of police departments around the country." He said officers, in their use-of-force training, "are taught not to create circumstances that place them at a situation where they have no choice." (Chisholm opted not to file criminal charges against Manney, saying Manney's use of force was justified self-defense.) Our rating Clinton said Hamilton, who was killed during a confrontation with Milwaukee police officer Christopher Manney, was "unarmed." Hamilton had no weapon when he was confronted by Manney. After Manney rousted Hamilton and began patting him down, a struggle ensued and Manney used his baton to strike Hamilton. Only then did Hamilton take the baton and strike Manney. That’s when Manney shot and killed Hamilton. Clinton’s statement is accurate, but needs clarification. That’s our definition of Mostly True. More on police use of force Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn said that in 2012, there were nearly 12.2 million arrests and only 410 "uses of deadly force" by police in the United States. Our rating was Mostly True. Flynn correctly quoted FBI statistics on arrests and justifiable homicides by law enforcement officers, although the 410 appeared to be an undercount of the number of people killed. PolitiFact National rated Half True a claim by National Urban League president Marc Morial, who said: "The number of killings of citizens by police is at a two-decade high." The former New Orleans mayor also cited FBI figures. But only a fraction of law enforcement agencies provide such data to the FBI, and the agencies that file the reports change from year to year, complicating comparisons. Conservative Michael Medved, a nationally syndicated radio talk show host, said: "More whites than blacks are victims of deadly police shootings." That earned a Half True from our partners at PunditFact. In absolute terms, the claim was accurate. But when comparing death rates, blacks are about three times more likely than whites to die in a confrontation with police.

pomt-10462	"As a state senator, he (Obama) even refused to support a measure to stop sex businesses from opening near schools or places of worship!"	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/23/focus-family-action/he-wanted-local-officials-to-decide/	A letter from the conservative group Focus on the Family Action makes a multifaceted attack on Sen. Barack Obama in an attempt to portray him as someone who would be "the most left-wing president in our nation's history." The article, written for the organization's Web site and widely circulated via chain e-mail, tries to paint Obama as bad for families, accusing him of everything from trying to further "the homosexual agenda" to being soft on the war against terrorists. Focus on the Family Action is the lobbying arm of Focus on the Family, an organization founded by evangelical Christian Dr. James Dobson. One of the claims in the article, written by Tom Minnery, senior vice president of Focus on the Family Action, is that, "As a state senator, he (Obama) even refused to support a measure to stop sex businesses from opening near schools or places of worship!" It's true. But before you go fitting Obama with Hugh Hefner-esque silk pajamas, some explanation is in order. The bill that came before the Illinois state Senate on March 29, 2001, sought to prohibit adult businesses from being located within 1,000 feet of public or private elementary or secondary schools, public parks, places of worship, preschools, day care facilities, mobile home parks or any areas zoned residential. Obama argued that kind of regulation is better handled by local officials through zoning. He noted that the City of Chicago opposed the bill as a pre-emption of its home rule. Addressing the assembly, Obama stated: "This is one of those areas where nobody likes, necessarily, to have — well, I don't say nobody, but most of us would prefer not to have an adult bookstore or movie theater or something next to our residence. But that's exactly why we have local zoning ordinances. And that's why, presumably, we have council members or heads of townships or all the various branches of local government who are much closer to the ground than we are in making these determinations. And it seems to me that if there's ever been a function that has historically been relegated to local control and it is appropriately there, it's these kinds of zoning matters. I would urge a No vote." But Obama didn't actually vote "no." He and four others voted "present." In the Illinois state Senate, lawmakers sometimes vote "present" instead of "no" to block bills without officially opposing them. (Earlier in the campaign, Sen. Hillary Clinton questioned whether Obama used present votes 129 times over eight years as an Illinois state senator to duck tough votes. PolitiFact examined Obama's present votes here. ) The political considerations here are obvious. Had he voted no, the attack would now be that "Obama opposed..." instead of the weaker "Obama refused to support..." The small distinction didn't appear to have saved Obama much grief. The vote came down 33 in favor; 15 against, with 5 voting "present." Because the bill needed 36 votes in favor — a three-fifths majority — it narrowly failed. Any implication that Obama's vote means that he supports sex businesses opening near schools or places of worship would be false. But in Minnery's article, which has been widely circulated through chain e-mail, he states that Obama "refused to support" a bill that would have prohibited sex shops near schools and places of worship. That's True.	None	Focus on the Family Action	None	None	None	2008-04-23T00:00:00	2008-03-26	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-11428	"Research shows that 1 percent of licensed dealers supply a whopping 57 percent of the guns that are recovered in crimes."	half-true	/florida/statements/2018/mar/16/cory-booker/are-1-percent-gun-retailers-responsible-more-half-/	As tens of thousands of students across the country walked out of their schools to protest gun violence, members of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee examined school safety procedures and gun policies ahead of the Parkland school shooting. During the hearing, Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., repeated a talking point among people who support gun restrictions and expressed the need to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. He said most guns used in crime come from only a handful of places. "We see guns pouring into our community, and we have found that a significant number of them are coming from a very small group of retailers that sell to criminals or straw purchasers," Booker said March 14, a month after the school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. He turned to Thomas Brandon, acting director of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives: "You’re aware of that, correct?" Brandon said yes, but Booker took the claim a step further: "We know the research shows that 1 percent of licensed dealers supply a whopping 57 percent of the guns that are recovered in crimes." Brandon said Booker’s claim rested on outdated research. "Yes, senator. That’s a study that, I think, is over 20 years old," Brandon said. "I would not agree with that statistic today." Booker continued to press Brandon about the distribution between licensed gun dealers and guns recovered in crimes and then talked about the need for more research on gun violence. Still, the differing assertions made us wonder about Booker’s statistic. As we’ve found in the past, a federal report from 2000 backs this up. But there are several caveats worth pointing out. Booker’s claim stems from 20-year-old data Booker's point matches data from a 2000 report from the federal Bureau of the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Department. The report found that 1.2 percent of licensed gun dealers accounted for more than 57 percent of the crime guns traced to current dealers in 1998. The study looked at the number of licensed retail dealers and pawnbrokers nationwide and aimed to track the movement of a firearm recovered by law enforcement officials from its first sale by the manufacturer. An ATF spokesman said the agency no longer uses that study to evaluate current crime trends. Frank Kelsey, chief of the public affairs division at ATF, said tracing a gun used in a crime back to a dealer does not necessarily indicate illegal activity by the dealer or its employees. And he noted that a gun might have changed hands any number of times — legally or illegally — before it was used in a crime. That said, there isn’t any more up-to-date information on the subject — and there’s a reason for that. In 2003, Congress and the George W. Bush administration, with the support of the National Rifle Association, passed the Tiahrt Amendment, which forbids ATF from sharing information about guns it has traced with the public except with state and local police agencies in the course of a criminal investigation. Two of the experts we reached out to (Daniel Webster, the director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, and Jaclyn Schildkraut, assistant professor of Public Justice, State University of New York at Oswego) said that they wouldn’t completely dismiss the findings of the 2000 report, unless there was any evidence that showed otherwise. Still, more information is needed. Glenn L. Pierce, the director of the Institute of Security and Public Policy at Northeastern University, helped compile the ATF’s 2000 analysis. Pierce said the pattern found in 1998, when there were 105,563 federal firearms licensees, is very similar to the pattern identified in the 1995/1996 first report to ATF, at which time there were about 258,000 federal firearms licensees. "At least over those years, the pattern stayed very much the same even (as) the number of (federal firearms licensees) showed a steep decline due to legislation implemented in 1994 during the Clinton administration," he said. Still, he said, it would be necessary for ATF to conduct another study to determine the extent to which this is actually the case today. "The firearms trace patterns found in the 1995 and 2000 reports might well persist today, but it would be necessary for ATF to conduct such a trace data analysis to determine the extent to which this actually the case." Our ruling Booker said, "Research shows that 1 percent of license dealers supply a whopping 57 percent of the guns that are recovered in crimes. Booker made his claim in the present tense, but the data that backs his point is almost 20 years old. We do not have better data to represent the current picture. The 2000 report traced the purchases of guns used in crimes back to the original dealer. But it didn’t take into account whether the firearm changed hands, illegally or legally, before it was used in a crime. That said, Booker is relying on the latest, best data available. Booker’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important information about the study's age. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-09112	The addition of a 1 percent sales tax would cost a typical household in Hillsborough County approximately $12 a month.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/jun/18/hillsborough-area-rapid-transit-hart/brochure-estimates-financial-impact-hillsborough-t/	After decades of fits and starts, Hillsborough County commissioners agreed to ask voters to consider a 1 percent sales tax increase for expanded bus service, light rail and road improvements. The issue will appear on the November ballot. One question many voters want answered: How much will the new tax cost me? In a brochure outlining how rapid transit can boost the economy and ease traffic congestion, Hillsborough Area Regional Transit says the tax will cost the average family $12 a month. That figure comes from the Hillsborough County Metropolitan Planning Organization’s long-range transportation plan. It puts the cost of a 1 cent sales tax for the average family at $142 a year, and the average for a single person at $85 a year. The MPO came up with those numbers by plugging the county’s household incomes into the IRS sales tax deduction calculator, available on the agency’s Web site. The IRS developed the calculator because tax rules allow people to deduct either sales taxes paid annually or state income tax from their federal returns, and the calculator enables them to arrive at a reasonable estimate without having to save a basket of receipts. MPO planner Beth Alden said she used average household income rather than median income. “The number we’ve been using is the higher one, just to be more conservative,” she said. The county’s average family of three has a household income of $77,852, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. A single household’s average income is $44,832. We plugged those figures into the IRS calculator and it showed the average family would pay $141.83 a year in local sales tax, which currently is 1 percent. A single person would pay $91.50. That’s virtually the same as the MPO estimates. The figure does not include sales taxes on major purchases, such as cars, mobile homes or construction materials for a house. Those are listed separately on tax returns. The county sales tax on items worth more than $5,000 is capped, meaning the maximum amount paid on any single item would be $50. But how accurate is the IRS calculator? Skeptical observers say it spits out a low figure. “It’s in the IRS’ interest to have that on the lower end, obviously, to decrease the deductions,” said Rusty Spoor, a tax accountant at Foley & Lardner. He guessed the calculator could be as much as 30 percent off. Like other tax experts, he noted it’s impossible to determine exactly how much people pay a year in sales taxes without saving receipts, so the IRS calculator is a useful tool. “That’s the best of the poorest options,” he said. “I don’t think that number’s great, but it’s the best starting point.” The calculator is based on spending patterns captured in the Consumer Expenditure Survey conducted annually by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, IRS spokesperson Florida Mike Dobzinski said. That’s the best method for calculating how much people pay in sales tax, according to Frank Williams, chief economist for the Florida Department of Revenue’s Office of Tax Research. “It should be fairly close,” he said. “It may understate it by 2 to 5 percent, but that’s just a gut feel.” Opponents of the sales tax say it will cost residents much more than the MPO estimates. Jim Hosler, a demographer running for Hillsborough County commissioner, initially figured it would cost households nearly $400 a year. He came up with that number by dividing the estimated revenue from the tax — about $174 million, according to the Florida Legislative Committee on Intergovernmental Relations — by 454,000, the approximate number of households in Hillsborough County. That comes about $383. Trouble is, residents aren’t the only ones who pay sales taxes. Tourists, commuters and businesses also pay them. Experts say there’s no way to know exactly who pays what, but most estimate that non-residents bear about 20 percent of the tax burden. Under that calculation, the cost is $307 per household. But that spreads out sales taxes equally among all households, regardless of income. And a household that earns $200,000 a year will pay much more in sales taxes than a $20,000 household, simply by virtue of having more disposable income. Hosler concedes his number may be high. “But their number is definitely a low number,” he said. “The real number is probably somewhere in between.” Clearly there are a number of ways to calculate the figure, and the result for all of them is a somewhat imprecise. Still, our research shows that the number in the brochure is very close to the one provided by the MPO, and HART used a recognized, legitimate source in coming up with the figure. The IRS calculation, while perhaps on the low side, is a recognized standard. So we rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-02564	Says Alex Sink "even supported a tax on homeowners insurance policies."	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/jan/31/national-republican-congressional-committee/alex-sink-supported-tax-homeowners-insurance-polic/	In the special election for a U.S. House seat, Republicans are taking aim at Democratic nominee Alex Sink’s career in both the public and private sector. On a website called The Real Alex Sink Truth Team -- intentionally aping Sink’s own Truth Team page -- the National Republican Campaign Committee calls her out for allegedly supporting higher taxes while serving as Florida’s elected chief financial officer, or CFO. "Alex Sink has consistently supported higher taxes, including property taxes, sales taxes, and taxes on water, sewer and cable television," the site reads. "She even supported a tax on homeowners insurance policies." We’ve seen all these claims often repeated during the campaign (so far, we’ve rated the one on water and TV Mostly True). But the one about whether she supported a tax on homeowners insurance deserves some attention. Avoiding a catastrophe To back up this claim, the the NRCC pointed us to a story in the Palm Beach Post from June 2008, after Sink had become CFO. The article detailed a Cabinet meeting between then-Gov. Charlie Crist and Sink, both of whom voted to extend a 1 percent assessment on private home, car, boat and motorcycle policies to cover a $625 million shortfall in the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, often referred to as the CAT fund. The assessment was put in place in 2007 to cover outstanding claims from the very heavy 2005 hurricane season. The purpose of the fund -- established in 1993 after Hurricane Andrew destabilized the state’s insurance market -- is to pay policyholders when insurers are unable to cover all their obligations. Because of the vast number of claims following Hurricane Wilma, the fund was falling short, so an emergency assessment was enacted to cover the lack of funds. By law, the fund only has to pay out claims to the extent of its cash balance, and it issues bonds to cover the difference should claims exceed that balance. To cover the repayment of those bonds, an emergency assessment is made on all policyholders to share the burden. The 2007 assessment was set to expire in 2012, but Crist and Sink changed that so the assessment would last until Dec. 31, 2014. The NRCC pointed to a partial quote from Sink, who said extending the assessment was "really a tax on insurance policies." But nuances keep this from being slam-dunk support for the NRCC’s claim. First, in a literal sense, the emergency assessment is not a tax. The state statute for the CAT fund says so. In addition, there’s evidence that Sink was not a fan of the process at work here. The fund was facing scads of new claims after Wilma, and Sink had been supporting changes in state law to shore up its finances. But state legislators hadn’t taken action on her recommendations before the extension. She and Attorney General Bill McCollum continued to press the Legislature for changes to Citizens after the extension, as well. "It's certainly not a good time to be telling homeowners they've got a $600 million tax increase in addition to what they were already paying," Sink was quoted as saying about a month before the vote, referring to the onset of the Great Recession and again characterizing the assessment as a tax. She confirmed to us through her campaign that she "believed it was not a good time to keep the assessment and was not an enthusiastic supporter of it." Crist and Sink both voiced concerns that state policyholders were on the hook for potentially fraudulent claims, but agreed to extend the assessment because CAT fund director Jack Nicholson said there were only about 10 or 20 weeks worth of money still available for payouts. One alternative would have been to increase the emergency assessment, which happened when it was bumped up to 1.3 percent in January 2011, covering an additional $676 million in bond payments, and is slated to last until July 1, 2016. A big reason for the shortfall was the poor estimates from insurers about how much they would need to cover claims, a process that happened in 2006, before Crist and Sink took office. Nicholson told PolitiFact the fund now "is in the best situation that it has ever been in financially," and that it would take storm claims in excess of $25 billion to force the state to issue more bonds. Our ruling The NRCC said Alex Sink "supported a tax on homeowners insurance policies," and it used Sink’s own words as evidence. In casting her Cabinet vote to extend an emergency assessment on policyholders to pay for hurricane claims, she did use the term "tax." However, it wasn’t officially a tax. And Sink supported the policy grudgingly, saying it was unfair that consumers would have to continue paying for old storm damages. Sink had a history before and after the Cabinet vote of trying to scale down the state’s exposure to hurricane coverage and reinsurance to private companies The ad is wrong to call it a tax, but Sink’s vote -- grudging though it was -- did serve to maintain an increase in insured consumers’ out-of-pocket costs, which had the effect of seeming a lot like a tax to policyholders. The claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, so we rate it Half True.

pomt-02813	Republican ideas on health care don’t give people "an option to even enroll in something that they can afford."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/26/donna-brazile/brazile-says-gop-lacks-plan-help-working-poor-get-/	Republicans have been pointing out the failures of the Obamacare rollout, telling voters, "We told you so." But the health care law’s problems aren’t a complete boon for the GOP. More and more, they’re getting questions about what their big ideas for health care are. Democratic pundit and sometimes political adviser Donna Brazile made that point during an installment of CNN’s Situation Room. "They have a blank slate," Brazile said. "They're not offering an alternative. They're not giving people who are desperately seeking health care an option to even enroll in something that they can afford." We asked Brazile if she was referring to the approximately 47 million uninsured people in the country and she told us "Yes. I was referring to those who would qualify for Medicaid, etc." We wanted to know what the Republican ideas would do to make insurance affordable for people of modest means. So we looked at some of the bills they’ve introduced this session to fact-check Brazile’s statement. Ideas on the Republican menu Not all but most of the nine bills on our list use the tax code to put more money in citizens’ pockets on the condition that the money will be spent on health care. We found three basic approaches that potentially address insurance affordability. Overhauling health care tax deductions The most generous proposal comes from the conservative Republican Study Committee, which put forward a bill with 100 cosponsors. H.R. 3121 would give a $7,500 deduction to individuals and a $20,000 deduction to families. We saw two big catches here. You would need to have insurance in the first place. Plus, the bill would eliminate the biggest tax break households enjoy today, the portion of their premiums paid by their employer. Getting rid of that $170 billion tax benefit would be a tough sell and a dramatic change to employer-provided insurance. Refundable tax credits These are like tax deductions, with the big difference that you can claim the credit even if you don’t have taxable income. H.R. 2300 from Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., offers a maximum tax credit of $5,000 for families making up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $47,000 a year. The bill covers the cost of the tax credits with a blend of savings from medical malpractice reform, reducing waste, fraud and abuse, and cuts in discretionary spending. Health Savings Accounts These are accounts that enjoy a trifecta of tax breaks. Money goes in tax-free, the returns on investment accumulates tax-free and some withdrawals are tax-free. Several bills loosen the rules on health savings accounts to allow more people to put more money into them. Other ideas Additional GOP ideas include medical malpractice reform, allowing small business to form their own insurance buying pools, letting insurers sell policies across state lines and subsidizing state high-risk pools for people who can’t insurance anyplace else. These changes would be significant but would have only an indirect impact on families seeking affordable insurance. Assessing the Republican options None of the Republican proposals have undergone an intensive independent analysis of how they would help the needy. Based on interviews with experts and our research, the two possibilities that would most directly provide affordable insurance are tax deductions and refundable tax credits. A tax deduction that would offset payroll taxes could touch many families of limited means. About 50 million taxpayers making less than $40,000 a year pay such taxes. But there’s a chicken-and-egg issue here. Until you have insurance, you can’t get the tax break and the bill doesn’t provide a way to help workers get over that hurdle. Plus, the bill relies on the elimination of the tax break on employer-sponsored health insurance. This would represent a radical shift in federal tax policy. In terms of feasibility, the majority of analysts we talked to give the edge to the refundable tax credit approach. That does not mean there is a resounding consensus on how much it would achieve. The proposal from Price would make credits payable in advance. In other words, you could use the federal credit even if you didn’t have the money up front to pay for insurance. While the details are different, this resembles the program put forward by President George W. Bush. A 2005 study of the Bush plan by the Tax Policy Center, a joint project by the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, found that "lower-income individuals experience the largest declines in uninsurance rates" under the Bush proposal. However, of the 45 million people uninsured then, Bush’s $3,000 tax credit plan would have helped only about 2 million people who made less than 200 percent of federal poverty and just a bit over 3 million overall. Thomas Buchmueller, a health economist at the University of Michigan, said it is a major undertaking to provide insurance to those who lack the money to pay for it. "Tinkering with tax deductions and making health savings accounts more attractive is not going to change that basic fact," Buchmueller said. "Roughly half of the Affordable Care Act coverage gains come from expanding Medicaid. I don't see anything in these proposals that would do much for the people who will gain Medicaid under the ACA." Conservative analysts see more promise in the use of refundable tax credits. Nina Owcharenko with the Heritage Foundation, a group that has supported tax credits for many years, wrote in 2005 that this approach could go far to level the playing field, "especially lower-income individuals who do not fit into today's patchwork health care system." One of the widest gaps between Democrats and Republicans is the basic understanding of what it means to offer a plan to people of limited means. For Democrats, a plan is an identified insurance policy, whether public, as in expanded Medicaid, or private, as in buying subsidized private insurance through a web-based, highly regulated marketplace. For Republicans, a plan is anything that makes buying insurance more affordable, however the person finds the policy. Our ruling Brazile said Republicans offer no option for those who are desperate for coverage the chance to enroll in something they can afford. Within a more Democratic definition of a plan, that claim is accurate. However, using a broader definition, the Republican plan to use refundable tax credits would likely have some impact on Americans of very limited means. Opinions vary widely on how many Americans this would help, but a program of this sort would do something for a portion of the people Brazile had in mind. While the Republican option is full of uncertainty and results might be limited, they are more than nothing. Still, supporters of the GOP reforms were unable to point to independent studies to show how much their ideas for tax deductions and tax credits would accomplish, and previous independent analysis suggests they would have a modest impact on reducing uninsurance rates. We rate Brazile's claim Mostly True.	None	Donna Brazile	None	None	None	2013-11-26T16:41:07	2013-11-19	['None']
pomt-01327	Rep. Carol Shea-Porter "votes with Nancy Pelosi’s Democrats 95 percent of the time," but Frank Guinta "will take on both parties" and has "independent New Hampshire values."	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2014/oct/24/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-ad-says-carol-shea-porter-partisan-democrat-f/	In New Hampshire’s highly competitive 1st Congressional District race, a Republican group is using a new ad to draw a stark contrast between Democratic Rep. Carol Shea-Porter and her GOP challenger, former Rep. Frank Guinta. Here’s the narration of the ad, which was paid for by the National Republican Congressional Committee, the House Republicans’ election arm: "Carol Shea-Porter votes with Nancy Pelosi’s Democrats 95 percent of the time. More spending, higher taxes. We need a change. As mayor, Frank Guinta brought a tax cap to Manchester and balanced four straight budgets. Frank will take on both parties. Cut spending, fight for a balanced budget, and restore Medicare to protect our seniors. Independent New Hampshire values, that’s Frank Guinta." But is the comparison in partisan voting patterns really that stark? The answer is no. Their records are easy to compare, because Shea-Porter and Guinta have traded off ownership of the seat over the past several election cycles. Shea-Porter was elected to the House in 2006 and 2008, lost to Guinta in 2010, then beat him in a rematch in 2012. The ad footnotes Shea-Porter’s 95 percent partisan voting record to a Washington Post vote study. That shows that Shea-Porter did indeed vote with her party 95 percent of the time in the current Congress. A similar study by Congressional Quarterly shows Shea-Porter’s partisan unity score ranging between 95 percent and 98 percent each year during her congressional career. So the ad has a point that Shea-Porter has loyally voted the party line in the House. The problem with the ad is in suggesting that Guinta has done the opposite. He hasn’t. The same Post tally shows that in Guinta’s term in Congress -- covering 2011 and 2012 -- he voted with his party 96 percent of the time. That’s barely distinguishable from how Shea Porter voted with her party. The CQ tally shows much the same: Guinta had a 97 percent partisan unity score in 2011 and 95 percent in 2012. NRCC spokesman Ian Prior countered with two arguments. First, he said that if Guinta had served as Manchester mayor with a "my-party-is-100-percent-right attitude, he wouldn’t have been able to implement a tax cap (or) balance four straight city budgets." Second, he said that Shea-Porter’s votes that make up that 95 percent "are out of touch with her district and show that she puts her own liberal agenda ahead of her district." Both points have merit but are far from bulletproof. On Prior’s first point, city-level policymaking tends to be more technocratic and shaped less by the national political partisanship that drives Congress. In the exact comparison between the two candidates -- how they have voted in Congress -- they have both voted in virtual partisan lockstep. On his second point, that Shea-Porter’s votes are out of step with the district, we’ll just note that the district voted for Obama for president not once but twice. It’s possible that voters have grown disgusted with his agenda since his 2012 reelection. We’ll soon find out: That’s what elections are for. Our ruling The NRCC ad says that Shea-Porter "votes with Nancy Pelosi’s Democrats 95 percent of the time," but Guinta "will take on both parties" and has "independent New Hampshire values." That’s a pretty stark comparison -- yet by the most apples-to-apples measurement of how both candidates have voted in Congress, Guinta scored a 96 percent partisan unity with Republicans during his term in Congress, which is hardly evidence of a big contrast.

pomt-02111	Says he’s "the only licensed firearms dealer in America running for Congress."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2014/may/14/john-stone/stone-claims-unique-position-gun-dealer/	It’s an attention-grabbing campaign ad. John Stone fires a cannon that he says resembles the one his forefathers used in the Revolutionary War. "As the only licensed firearms dealer in America running for Congress, I’m willing to do the same if we have to," Stone declares on the video. "But it's a whole lot easier just to vote in new House Republican leaders who will stand up to Obama and defend our Constitution." Stone, a Republican and former congressional aide, is making his second bid to unseat five-term 12th District U.S. Rep. John Barrow, a Democrat from Augusta. He last tried in 2008. The Second Amendment is a galvanizing issue, and politicians know it. Barrow pulled out his father’s gun, his grandfather’s gun and his National Rifle Association endorsement for an ad when he was fending off other challengers two years ago. And it’s unlikely that many would say it was coincidence that this year, with the entire General Assembly up for re-election, state lawmakers passed a gun bill that the NRA called the "most comprehensive" in recent Georgia history and that critics decried as one of the nation’s most extreme. But can Stone really say he’s the only licensed firearms dealer in America running for Congress? We decided a fact check was in order. We saw the potential to check Stone’s claim. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives keeps a database of all federal firearms licenses, so a check of those names against the names of all U.S. House and Senate candidates could do the trick. The only problem: There are about 140,000 current federal firearms licenses, and many are issued in the names of businesses and corporations, not individuals. Stone was forthcoming with us about his license (he even emailed us a copy) and about how he came to make his only-one-in-the-country claim. Friends in the firearms industry pointed out to him in 2012 that he might be the only U.S. House candidate with an ATF license, Stone said. He said he went to multiple sources for verification, including the NRA, Gun Owners of America, the National Shooting Sports Foundation and the ATF. "To everyone’s knowledge, I am the only one," Stone said. "I have Google and Bing searched this extensively, and to the best of my knowledge and ability to check, I am the only one." He volunteered that he would change his ad if another candidate were found to be able to make the same claim. But our research turned up another question: Can he really call himself a dealer? Stone has a federal firearms license. It is what’s known as a Curio and Relic license. He collects, restores and trades historic firearms, at least 50 years old, and as a hobby, not a business. When we asked the ATF to assist in our search for his license, we were told that, based on a code on the license, "he’s a collector, not a dealer," a distinction we wondered about since his ad says dealer. The ATF does issue what it labels as "dealer" licenses. They are largely reserved for gunsmiths, pawnbrokers and others who make a living buying and selling many types of guns. Jerry Henry, with the gun advocacy group GeorgiaCarry.org, said he thinks Stone’s YouTube claim is "misleading at best." "He’s a collector," Henry said. "That’s not what I consider a firearms dealer." Others we talked to agreed. Tim Coker with the National Firearms Dealer Network said gun enthusiasts hearing the claim would assume that Stone is a licensed dealer, selling modern firearms. NRA officials were not aware of Stone’s claim, spokesman Andrew Arulanandam said. The group has been a Barrow supporter. "He (Barrow) has stood steadfast with gun owners, hunters and sportsmen thought his career," Arulanandam said. Stone remains insistent. He sent us two dictionary definitions of dealer. He also said he deals in black-powder firearms and pre-1899 firearms, which require no ATF license, restrictions or registration on buying and selling. "I am a firearms dealer. I buy and sell firearms," he said. "This fact is indisputable." When we first started the fact check, we asked Stone why he decided to tout the fact that he was a federal firearms dealer. He said the discussion of where a candidate stands on Second Amendment rights can be time-consuming. With the dealer moniker as his calling card, he said his position is immediately clear. In summary, Stone, a former congressional aide, has proclaimed himself the "only licensed firearms dealer in America running for Congress." He said he wasn’t able to document that statement, but after talking with people in the firearms community, he believes it’s true. We couldn’t find any sources to definitively prove or disprove Stone’s claim of exclusivity. He does have a federal firearms license for a very niche group of collectors. He contends this status allows him to make the claim that he is a gun dealer. Others suggest his statement is misleading. Overall, a viewer of Stone’s ad needs much more information to weigh the value of his claim -- an awful lot of context is missing even though there is some truth to part of his statement. We rate the statement Half True.	None	John Stone	None	None	None	2014-05-14T00:00:00	2014-04-23	['United_States', 'United_States_Congress']
pomt-15081	"We had a three-hour debate, no discussion about the national debt, very little about the economy."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/20/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-cnn-debate-had-no-question-debt-a/	The high polling numbers for the GOP presidential field’s "outsider" candidates are in part the result of the media refusing to discuss substantive issues, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos. Rubio said on the Sept. 20, 2015, episode of This Week that political newcomers like Donald Trump, Carly Fiorina and Ben Carson were seeing success because people were tired of establishment candidates. But the CNN debate earlier in the week in Simi Valley, Calif., also showed that coverage isn’t focused on the country’s problems, he said. "I don’t think it’s limited to the politicians, it’s also the media," Rubio said. "We had a three-hour debate, no discussion about the national debt, very little about the economy. It was a constant he-said-she-said, what do you say because so-and-so called you this name or that name." What did the candidates really discuss during the debate? We reviewed the transcript and wouldn’t say there was "no discussion" about the debt, but Rubio has a point there was little said about the economy. The economy We’ll actually start with how much the candidates said about the economy, because it came up first, much in the way Rubio described. (We reached out to his campaign for more on this but didn’t hear back.) After lengthy discussions about Trump’s worthiness as a candidate, Russia’s involvement in Syria, Congress attempting to defund Planned Parenthood, immigration and other issues, moderator Jake Tapper switched gears. "We've received a lot of questions on social media about the economy and about jobs," he acknowledged, but used the pivot to asked Fiorina to respond to Trump’s criticism of her record as CEO of Hewlett-Packard. Fiorina then recounted her history with the company, before mentioning voter concerns over the nation’s $18 trillion debt as an attack on Trump. "There are a lot of us Americans who believe that we are going to have trouble someday paying back the interest on our debt because politicians have run up mountains of debt using other people's money," Fiorina said to Trump. "That is in fact precisely the way you ran your casinos. You ran up mountains of debt, as well as losses, using other people's money, and you were forced to file for bankruptcy not once, not twice, four times, a record four times." Tapper later asked questions about the minimum wage and tax policy, which one could argue are related to the economy. But he asked no direct questions about job creation or debt. Still, candidates did mention the economy as they addressed other questions. Ohio Gov. John Kasich said that when he left Congress, "we had a $5 trillion surplus, and the economy was booming." He implied his time as a congressman from 1982 to 2001 will help him find consensus as president to "create a stronger economy for everybody." Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker pointed out Democratic hopeful Hillary Clinton’s call for a higher minimum wage is "her answer to grow the economy." Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee mentioned that finding cures to cancer, heart disease, diabetes and Alzheimer’s will save the country trillions, and would "change the economy and the country." Rubio, meanwhile, discussed the economy when answering a question about climate change. He said disregarding alarms raised by "the left-wing government" was necessary because "every proposal they put forward are going to be proposals that will make it harder to do business in America, that will make it harder to create jobs in America." "We are not going to destroy our economy," he said. "We are not going to make America a harder place to create jobs in order to pursue policies that will do absolutely nothing, nothing to change our climate, to change our weather, because America is a lot of things, the greatest country in the world, absolutely." New Jersey Gov. Christie also made mention of agreeing with Rubio that "we shouldn't be destroying our economy in order to chase some wild left-wing idea that somehow us by ourselves is going to fix the climate." Back in April, PolitiFact checked a statement by Rubio that "with certainty (cap and trade) would have a devastating impact on our economy." We rated it False. The national debt So candidates did discuss the economy, though with little in the way of concrete plans. There also were a few mentions of the national debt, in addition to Fiorina’s attack on Trump. Christie cited debt service as a major portion of what the federal budget is stuck dealing with. "Seventy one percent of all federal spending is on entitlements and debt service," he said. Bush said his 4 percent economic growth plan will "deal with the structural fiscal problems that exist because of our entitlement problems that will overwhelm and create way too much debt," but didn’t discuss specifics about controlling projected costs. Rubio brought up the national debt while trading barbs with Trump; Rubio mentioned the debt as a symptom of Washington dysfunction. "You have millions of people in this country living paycheck to paycheck, and nothing is being done about it," Rubio said. "We are about to leave our children with $18 trillion in debt, and they're about to raise the debt limit again." Our ruling Rubio said, "We had a three-hour debate, no discussion about the national debt, very little about the economy." He’s right there was very little mention of the economy, but the national debt was brought up by some of the 11 candidates, usually while addressing an opponent. We should note that even then, no one gave any specifics about what to do beyond some broad talking points. We rate Rubio’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-00291	Says Sen. Bill Nelson is a socialist.	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2018/sep/27/rick-scott/gov-rick-scotts-ridiculous-statement-sen-bill-nels/	As dead fish washed up on some Florida shores, politicians dished blame about red tide. Now they are debating another type of red scare: socialism. "Bill Nelson and Andrew Gillum — they're socialists," Gov. Rick Scott said at a Titusville event for his U.S. Senate campaign. Scott explained his comments further in an interview with Florida Today. "They want big government and socialism," Scott said. "They're both into higher taxes. Gillum said he's going to raise corporate taxes 40 percent. Nelson said that, if the Democrats get control, he's going to go back and raise the taxes. They don't believe that the tax cuts that we did this year are good for our state. If you look at their programs, they just want government to run everything." Scott linked the duo as offering a "very liberal, very radical and very risky direction for our state and country." We’ve previously rated a claim from Gillum’s opponent Ron DeSantis that Gillum has a "far left socialist platform" akin to Venezuela as False. Scott’s labeling of Nelson as a socialist is a misleading red-scare tactic — one from the Republican playbook this cycle after the surprise Democratic primary win of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a democratic socialist, in New York. Calling a politician in Florida a socialist packs particular punch because some Hispanic voters, a battleground demographic, have fled socialist regimes. What is socialist about Nelson’s record? Nelson has praised Gillum and may get a boost from the voter excitement he is generating. But he does not share Gillum’s more liberal positions. Scott’s campaign said in a press release that Nelson called Gillum's support for higher taxes, government-run health care and abolishing ICE "mainstream." The campaign linked to a Miami Herald article that didn’t make those points. The article said that Nelson and Gillum "represent two diverging camps of the Florida Democratic Party." Nelson said that Gillum’s policies weren’t too progressive for Florida, but he made no specific reference to raising taxes, government-run health care or abolishing ICE. Here is what Nelson actually said about Gillum’s platform: "You characterize it as being to the left," Nelson said to reporters. "You look at his positions, they’re mainstream: strengthening education, pay teachers, clean up the environment. Go through all the issues and I think that’s where the people of Florida are." In an interview with the Tampa Bay Times editorial board, Nelson showed that he doesn’t share all of Gillum’s views. Nelson said he doesn’t want to abolish ICE. When asked about Medicare for All, Nelson didn’t show interest. "I've got enough trouble just trying to save Obamacare," Nelson said. "I'm into results." Even though it doesn’t factually check out, the Scott campaign also said that Nelson "voted more than 300 times to raise taxes" — which we have rated False. Scott inflates the number by including nonbinding budget resolutions and multiple votes on the same piece of legislation. The list neglects that Nelson has, on occasion, voted for lower taxes. Nelson has been a critic of the 2017 tax bill, but that doesn’t mean he wants to raise taxes across the board. He said the bill didn’t do enough to help the middle class and shown support for reversing some cuts that benefit the rich. The Scott campaign also said that Nelson "embraced Obama’s plan to appease Cuban dictators and palled around with Assad and Hugo Chavez." But Nelson repeatedly criticized Chavez in 2004 and 2005, calling him a "serious threat." While While Nelson agreed with Obama’s decision to normalize relations with Cuba in 2014, Nelson has criticized Castro. (We fact-checked a similar attack by a GOP group about Nelson’s statements about Chavez and the Castro brothers and rated it Pants on Fire.) Experts said the socialist label doesn’t apply to Nelson Socialism is when the government owns (or at least controls) the means of production. Nelson hasn’t called for a government takeover of businesses. "Claiming that Nelson is a socialist is ludicrous," said Philip J. Williams, professor at the Center for Latin American studies at the University of Florida. "His stance in opposition to the tax cut bill and in support of Medicaid expansion are mainstream Democratic positions. (Even some Republican governors have supported Medicaid expansion, including John Kasich.)" While some might describe Medicare or Medicaid as socialism, because the government is providing health insurance to citizens, the health industry remains in private hands, said Sean D. Ehrlich, a Florida State University political science professor. "The government doesn’t control the production of health care," Ehrlich said, "they merely regulate some elements and reimburse providers and consumers for their health care costs." University of Miami professor Merike Blofield, an expert in Latin American and comparative politics, said that by the standards of other wealthy liberal democracies with public, universal health care, Nelson’s policy proposals are conservative. Our ruling Scott’s description of Nelson as a "socialist" is an inaccurate red scare tactic. The definition of socialism is a government takeover of production, and Nelson hasn’t called for that. Scott’s campaign pointed to Nelson’s support for Gillum, the Democrat running to the left of Nelson in the governor’s race. While Nelson has shown enthusiasm for Gillum, they are not lockstep on all issues. Gillum has called for abolishing ICE and Medicare for All, and Nelson has said he does not agree. Nelson’s criticism of the Republican tax bill isn’t the same as calling for higher taxes in general. And supporting an expansion of Medicaid is not the same as calling for government-run health care.

pomt-03688	"No poll done this year ... shows less than a majority to reinstate a federal ban on assault weapons."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/apr/22/dianne-feinstein/sen-dianne-feinstein-says-every-national-poll-year/	Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., told fellow senators before they voted down her renewed ban on assault weapons that the American people sided with her. What’s more, she told them: Every poll said so. "In poll after poll, that support is there," she remarked from the Senate floor on April 17, 2013, the same day broader gun control legislation failed. "In no poll — even with all the discussion, even with the mobilization of gun owners and the NRA, a majority in every single national poll done shows that the majority want controls over assault weapons. I know of no poll done this year that shows less than a majority to reinstate a federal ban on assault weapons." A 1994 assault weapons ban, written by Feinstein, lapsed in 2004. After a gunman killed 20 children at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December 2012, she proposed the Assault Weapons Ban of 2013 — a renewal and expansion of the original ban. Senators, who considered it as an amendment to a broader bill, voted 40 to 60 against it. Did they vote against a majority of Americans? "No poll done this year ... shows less than a majority to reinstate a federal ban on assault weapons," Feinstein said. We went in search of polls. ‘Assault weapons’ We combed through 18 polls with questions about assault weapons conducted between Jan. 9 and April 7. Nearly half of them occurred in January, both before and after President Barack Obama released his plan to reduce gun violence. He called for "banning military-style assault weapons." Feinstein’s bill, introduced a week after the president’s plan, proposed blocking the future manufacture, possession, sale and importation of 157 specific "semiautomatic assault weapons," such as AK-47s and UZIs, along with any other weapon with a detachable magazine and at least one "military characteristic," such as a pistol grip or barrel shroud. Pollsters used a range of phrases to describe firearms as they asked Americans about their support or opposition to a ban, from "assault rifles and semiautomatic weapons" to "military-style assault weapons." Here's a quick look at the results: Poll Date Question Support for ban Reason-Rupe Jan. 17-21, 2013 "Do you think people should be prohibited from owning assault weapons, or should people be allowed to own them?" 44% CNN/ORC International April 5-7, 2013 "Please tell me whether you would generally favor or oppose each of the following proposals which some people have made to reduce the amount of gun violence. ... A ban on the manufacture, sale and possession of so-called assault rifles, capable of semi-automatic fire, such as the AR-15." 51% * Fox News/Anderson Robbins Research/Shaw & Company Research March 17-19, 2013 "Do you favor or oppose each of the following proposals to reduce gun violence? ... Banning assault rifles and semi-automatic weapons." 51% * Quinnipiac University Feb. 27 - March 4, 2013 "Do you support or oppose ... a nationwide ban on the sale of assault weapons?" 54% Fox News/Anderson Robbins Research/Shaw & Company Research Jan. 15-17, 2013 "Do you favor or oppose each of the following proposals to reduce gun violence? ... Banning assault rifles and semi-automatic weapons." 54% McClatchy/Marist March 4-7, 2013 "Do you favor or oppose a ban on assault weapons?" 55% Pew Research Center Jan. 9-13, 2013 "Please tell me if you favor or oppose the following proposals about gun policy ... a ban on assault style weapons." 55% Pew Research Center Feb. 13-18, 2013 "Please tell me if you favor or oppose the following proposals about gun policy ... a ban on assault style weapons." 56% CNN/Time/ORC International Jan. 14-15, 2013 "Please tell me whether you would generally favor or oppose each of the following proposals which some people have made to reduce the amount of gun violence. . . . A ban on the manufacture, sale and possession of semi-automatic assault guns, such as the AK-47." 56% Quinnipiac University Jan. 30-Feb. 4, 2013 "Do you support or oppose ... a nationwide ban on the sale of assault weapons?" 56% ABC News/Washington Post April 11-14, 2013 "Would you support or oppose a law requiring a nationwide ban on the sale of assault weapons?" 56% ABC News/Washington Post March 7-10, 2013 "Would you support or oppose a law requiring a nationwide ban on the sale of assault weapons?" 57% University of Connecticut/Hartford Courant Jan. 22-28, 2013 "Please tell me if you would favor or oppose the following proposals made as ways to control gun violence. . . . Banning military style assault weapons" 57%- strongly favor (48) or somewhat favor (9) ABC News/Washington Post Jan. 10-13, 2013 "Would you support or oppose a law requiring a nationwide ban on the sale of assault weapons?" 58% Morning Joe/Marist March 25-27, 2013 "Do you support or oppose legislation that would ban the sale of assault weapons?" 59% Quinnipiac University March 26 - April 1, 2013 "Do you support or oppose ... a nationwide ban on the sale of assault weapons?" 59% Gallup Jan. 19-20, 2013 "Suppose that on Election Day you could vote on key issues as well as candidates. Would you vote for or against a law that would … reinstate and strengthen the ban on assault weapons that was in place from 1994 to 2003?" 60% Johns Hopkins/GfK Jan. 2-14, 2013 "Banning the sale of military-style, semiautomatic assault weapons that are capable of shooting more than 10 rounds of ammunition without reloading." 69% * Majority not large enough to be statistically significant. In 15 polls, conducted by organizations from ABC News/Washington Post to Quinnipiac University, the idea of a ban on such weapons got support from 54 percent to 69 percent of respondents, depending on the timing and phrasing of the question. In two, from CNN/ORC International and Fox News in April and March, support was 51 percent — with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. That means the polls reflected support between 48 percent and 54 percent, perhaps a majority and perhaps not. In other words, the "majority" wasn’t statistically significant. And one poll, from the libertarian Reason Foundation, asked the question in a distinctly different way, and got a different result. Most pollsters asked whether people supported or opposed a ban on assault weapons. Reason asked: "Do you think people should be prohibited from owning assault weapons, or should people be allowed to own them?" They found that just 44 percent of respondents thought people should be prohibited from owning assault weapons. We’ll note that the question goes beyond Feinstein’s legislation. Nothing in the bill would have prohibited people who already owned such weapons from keeping them. Still, argued Emily Ekins of Reason, "response variability across polls demonstrates support for an assault weapons ban is not as clear cut as some may have previously thought." Indeed, a USA Today/Gallup poll from December, in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook shootings, also showed only 44 percent support for a law similar to Feinstein’s. Meanwhile, polls showed a partisan divide. In a January poll from Pew Research Center, for example, 55 percent of respondents favored an assault weapons ban. But just 44 percent of Republicans did. And a separate poll from Quinnipiac University in February showed that nearly half of Republicans might be less likely to vote for a member of Congress who voted for a ban on the sale of assault weapons — in addition to a third of independents and 11 percent of Democrats. That lack of support was most pronounced in the West. So, while national support was generally strong, as Feinstein said, individual lawmakers faced a different reality. Our ruling Feinstein claimed that a majority of the American people supported her bill, saying "no poll done this year ... shows less than a majority to reinstate a federal ban on assault weapons." She's largely accurate, though the "majority" in two national polls wasn’t statistically significant, and a poll by a libertarian foundation showed less than majority support for prohibiting assault weapon ownership. Meanwhile, limiting her statement to "this year" excluded a USA Today/Gallup poll from December that undermined her point. Still, the libertarian poll went beyond Feinstein’s proposal, which didn’t prohibit ownership of assault weapons by those who already own them. Otherwise, two polls teetered on the edge of majority support, while 15 others unequivocally supported her claim. We rate her statement Mostly True.

pomt-15331	"We don’t have a (military) reserve force if something happens."	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/jul/14/joe-theismann/former-nfl-qb-joe-theismann-we-dont-have-reserve/	Former NFL quarterback Joe Theismann recently joined the all-female cast of Fox News’ Outnumbered to offer his perspective on recent news, from a federal judge ordering the logo of his former team to be canceled to the slaying of a San Francisco woman that sparked fresh debate about this country’s immigration policy. Theismann called the murder of Kathryn Steinle, 32, a tragedy and bemoaned the porous borders that allow undocumented immigrants to access the country, including the alleged killer, a Mexican felon who had been deported five times named Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez. After criticizing Donald Trump’s proposal to build a wall on the border as an unrealistic fix, Theismann warned that budget cuts to the military are making the already chaotic environment worse. "Our border patrol is spread out so thin that people just walk through, they don’t even know they’re there," Theismann said during the July 9 episode. "We’re faced with a situation now where you talk about National Guardsmen going down there. We’re about to cut the military by 40,000 people, which is another subject. We went from 500,000 down to 400,000. "We don’t have a reserve force if something happens." The retired quarterback who later had a long career as a sports broadcaster threw out a slew of facts, but the last one sounded the most alarming. Are U.S. leaders really sacrificing the military reserve as they whip the country into top fiscal shape? No — a fact Theismann acknowledged during a phone call with PunditFact. Theismann said he was trying to highlight cuts to the military that are, in fact, happening due to automatic federal spending cuts known as sequestration. But he took it too far. "With all the things that are happening in the world, especially in the Middle East right now, if we ever felt like we needed to get our ground forces involved, what position would we be in to deal with any difficult situation that could come up anywhere in the world?" Theismann told us. "Because I still believe that we should be the world power and by continuing to cut the military, I think we diminish the ability to be the biggest stick in the valley." "That was what I was trying to say in a short period," Theismann said. America’s reserve military forces include both the reserves and the National Guard. People may use the terms interchangeably, but they are different. National Guard units are jointly controlled by both state governors and the president and often respond to state-level emergencies, including riots, hurricanes and other disasters. Full reserves fall under the control of the president and the branch of the military in which they serve. Theismann clarified that he was talking about the Army Reserve, not the Army National Guard or other components of the National Guard. While it’s important to have your vocabulary correct, it doesn’t really affect the accuracy of Theismann’s claim either way. Both the National Guard and reserves expect cuts. But both will most definitely continue. The Army National Guard is scheduled to shed 15,000 soldiers by Sept. 30, 2017, as part of sequestration. This will bring the Army National Guard to 335,000 soldiers — down from its current size of 350,000. The Air National Guard will not lose positions due to sequestration, said National Guard spokesman Kurt M. Rauschenberg. The Army Reserve also expects to lose positions. On July 9, coincidentally the same day as this episode of Outnumbered, the U.S. Army announced how it would go about budget cuts that would affect active and reserve military. The Army Reserve said its force would drop to 185,000 if sequestration continues through the 2017 fiscal year, part of an overall cut of 60,000 soldiers. The active military could fall to 450,000 soldiers by the end of fiscal year 2018, down from 570,000 in 2012 after the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Under the current plan for cuts, the overall Army would drop from 1,042,200 soldiers to 980,000, a total that includes active-duty Army (full-time), Army National Guard (part-time, can be activated to respond to state emergencies) and Army Reserve (part-time branch of the Army). Army Reserve employees would fall from 202,000 soldiers to 195,000 by the end of the 2017 fiscal year. "I believe that where we are now is about as low as we can go," Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno told reporters in a May conference call, according to Army Times. "If we continue to go lower, we're going to have to say we cannot do all the things we're doing today." Our ruling Warning of a shorthanded military amid a border crisis, Theismann said, "We don’t have a reserve force if something happens." Theismann later admitted he didn’t choose his words very carefully. Automatic federal cuts as part of sequestration are shrinking the military. Leaders have warned that cuts could reduce the Army’s ability to respond to crises. But the Army Reserve, which Theismann says he was talking about, very much remains in existence. The Reserve would be available, along with the National Guard, to assist the border patrol or active military in emergencies. We rate his claim False.

pomt-02273	Says he was the only statewide elected official to speak in favor of a federal guest worker plan at the 2012 Republican Party of Texas convention.	true	/texas/statements/2014/apr/08/jerry-patterson/jerry-patterson-flew-solo-among-statewide-elected-/	Jerry Patterson, an unsuccessful candidate for lieutenant governor this year, subsequently said that he somewhat uniquely spoke out for a federal guest-worker program a few years ago. According to a March 30, 2014, news story in the San Antonio Express-News, Republicans including state Sen. Dan Patrick of Houston, who's in a May 27, 2014, runoff for the party's lieutenant governor nomination with incumbent David Dewhurst, have talked about not putting language supportive of a guest-worker program in this year’s party platform, which is to be finalized by delegates to the next state convention in June 2014. Patrick has stumped on securing the Texas-Mexico border, also objecting in a Jan. 25, 2014, Twitter post to the "illegal invasion." The Express-News story described Patterson, the state land commissioner since 2003, as saying he was the only statewide elected official to speak in favor of the guest-worker plank at the June 2012 state convention where it was initially adopted. Patterson separately said on his 2014 campaign website: "Many of my elected colleagues privately expressed support, but told me that they just couldn’t take the risk." Did Patterson, who often flies his own plane between cities, venture solo in this way? Immigration in 2012 platform The immigration plank, on page 21 of the platform, states that mass deportation of all the undocumented individuals in the United States "would neither be equitable nor practical," while "blanket amnesty" would only encourage more illegal entries. The plank also calls for securing the border, modernizing Social Security cards and limiting birthright citizenship to babies born to a U.S. citizen. Finally, the plank calls for a temporary worker program "to bring skilled and unskilled workers into the United States for temporary periods of time when no U.S. workers are currently available," to be self-funded through participation fees and fines, the plank says. The guest-worker plank was characterized by proponents at the time as a meaningful breakthrough for the state party. A June 9, 2012, Texas Tribune news story quoted TexasGOPvote.com's Bob Price, a convention delegate, as saying adoption of the guest-worker provisions "takes away a tool that Democrats have used for years to drive a wedge between conservative Hispanics and Republicans." William Kelberlan, a delegate from Williamson County, told the Tribune: "It was a tough pill to swallow; it didn't go down easily." Kelberlan said he recognized the need for immigration reform but thought more time was needed to hammer out the details of what form it should take. Patterson spoke in favor of the guest-worker plank, according to the story, but it was silent on whether he was the sole statewide elected official to do so. Patterson invokes 'cojones' To our inquiry, Patterson indicated he remembers his solo status well. "Ain’t much to elaborate," he said by email. Asked if he’d heard the speeches given by other statewide elected officials and why he knows he was alone in this regard, Patterson replied: "I know all the statewides. I know what they do and say. I know who has cojones" (um, courage) "and who doesn't. I was the only one." By email, Steve Munisteri, the party chairman, confirmed Patterson was the only statewide elected official to speak during floor debate of the guest-worker plank and then only after delegates agreed to let him do so, Munisteri said. Separately, Brad Bailey told us he helped draft the relevant language as a delegate from Senate District 11 in Houston. By phone, Bailey said Patterson was alone among statewide elected officials in speaking about the guest-worker section. Main speeches lacked mention of guest-worker idea We didn't have to take anyone's word for this. Munisteri reminded us the party placed video recordings of the convention online. So we watched the speeches given by several statewide elected officials: U.S. Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison and John Cornyn; Gov. Rick Perry; Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst; Attorney General Greg Abbott; Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples and State Comptroller Susan Combs. None — plus Patterson, in his main speech to the convention — aired support for a guest-worker law. In fact, only Staples mentioned conditions near the Texas-Mexico border. Patterson spoke from floor during platform debate But as delegates discussed the party platform, Patterson stepped to a microphone on the convention floor after Munisteri adjudged that two-thirds of the delegates, by a show of hands, had agreed to suspend the rules to let him join the conversation even though he wasn’t a delegate. (Hear Patterson’s remarks starting about the 11:15 mark of the video here.) Patterson opened by describing himself as a conservative who believes the platform’s immigration plank and border security "go hand in hand." He then said he supported the then-pending state law requiring most voters to present photo identification at the polls as well as initiatives stressing English as the state’s primary language. Patterson said he also supported a physical barrier on the U.S.-Mexico border, including a fence in some cases. He added that he opposed "unconditional birthright citizenship," bilingual "balance" and restrictions on police officers asking someone’s immigration status during an apprehension or investigation of a crime. Further, he said, he was opposed to amnesty for illegal immigrants. But, Patterson said, "I will tell you… that I very loudly, firmly and with great fervor support… a guest-worker program as part of our border security." "We have folks in this country who are here to do us harm," Patterson said. "They are criminal, they are coyotes, they run things back and across the border whether they are illegals, whether they are drugs or contraband. "And we also have folks in this country," Patterson continued, "who want to work hard, pay their taxes, obey our laws. And there is no way for those to come here and do that lawfully because our immigration system is broken. We need a guest-worker, temporary guest-worker program that is in the immigration plank in our platform," he said. Our ruling Patterson said he was unique among statewide elected officials in speaking for the guest-worker section that became part of the Republican Party of Texas platform in 2012. True.

pomt-10178	"I introduced a bill that would’ve helped stop the multimillion-dollar bonus packages that CEOs grab on their way out.. (McCain) opposed that idea."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/25/barack-obama/mccain-never-talked-about-the-bill/	As Congress worked through the details of a $700-billion bailout of the financial system, the presidential candidates zeroed in on the issue of executive pay and skirmished over who could rightly take credit for sounding an alarm about highly compensated CEOs at troubled financial firms. Appearing in Dunedin, Fla., on Sept. 24, Barack Obama depicted John McCain as a recent convert on the issue of corporate accountability, and took credit for introducing legislation last year that would have imposed some formal restraint on big bonuses and severance payments that corporations routinely award top executives. "In the last few days, my opponent has decided to start talking tough about CEO pay. He’s suddenly a hard-charging populist. And that’s all well and good," Obama said. "But I sure wish he was talking the same way over a year ago, when I introduced a bill that would’ve helped stop the multimillion-dollar bonus packages that CEOs grab on their way out the door. Because he opposed that idea." Obama also lamented that McCain didn't join him in demanding accountability from troubled mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, whose former chief executives received pay and bonus packages worth a combined $24-million. Obama was trying to tap into mounting public frustration over the prospect of CEOs exiting their posts with lavish pay and benefit packages while taxpayers cover the cost of saving their former firms. The Bush administration yielded this week to demands from congressional critics in both parties that the proposed bailout package include a provision to limit the pay packages of those executives whose companies would benefit from the bailout. But is Obama’s populist attack grounded in facts? We’ve already dealt with McCain’s response to the problems at Fannie and Freddie here (he called for a vigorous response to a 2006 report detailing shady accounting at Fannie) and his position on the bailout of the giant insurer American International Group in this item (he said management and speculators who created the mess shouldn’t be bailed out). It’s true that Obama wrote a bill that would have changed federal securities law to require shareholders of publicly traded companies to hold nonbinding votes on executive compensation packages. The measure, introduced on April 20, 2007, was one of a number of proposals circulating in Congress at the time that attempted to apply limits to executive compensation. But Obama's proposal has never come up for a hearing or a vote in the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. As for Obama’s contention that McCain opposed the measure, we reviewed McCain’s public statements and found nothing in his press releases or in the Congressional Record expressing opposition or support for Obama’s bill. We asked Obama’s campaign for evidence that McCain was against the proposal. They provided a copy of remarks McCain senior policy adviser Douglas Holtz-Eakin made to the Wall Street Journal in April 2008 that the Arizona senator opposes legislative or regulatory fixes for executive pay problems, preferring private-sector intervention. But as early as 2002 McCain criticized excessive executive pay packages in the wake of the accounting scandal at energy giant Enron Corp. In a July 11, 2002, appearance at the National Press Club, McCain outlined a series of steps to "restore public confidence in corporate America" that included forcing executives to return any compensation directly received from their proven misconduct and preventing them from selling holdings of company stock while serving in that company. So Obama can legitimately take credit for introducing legislation that took aim at executive pay practices that have aroused tremendous public ire in the wake of the proposed financial bailout. But there's simply no evidence to support Obama's contention that McCain "opposed that idea." We can find no record that McCain ever uttered an opinion on Obama's proposal, and in fact it's clear that McCain has criticized excessive executive payouts in the past. The only thing the Obama campaign has to support its contention that McCain opposed Obama's executive pay bill is a remark in a news story from one of his to advisers about McCain's general preference for private-sector remedies — a remark made a full year after the Obama bill was introduced. It's not unreasonable to think McCain might have preferred a different approach to what Obama proposed, but that's just not enough to support what Obama is saying. We rate this attack Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04121	"Every day, 34 Americans are murdered with guns."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jan/09/pardeep-kaleka/son-sikh-temple-mass-shooting-victim-34-gun-murder/	After his father and five other worshippers were killed Aug. 5, 2012, in a mass shooting at the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin, Pardeep Kaleka joined a national campaign to address gun violence. Kaleka’s father, Satwant Singh Kaleka, died trying to stop gunman Wade Michael Page, who also wounded four other people, including a police officer, before killing himself. Pardeep Kaleka took part in promoting Demand a Plan, an effort to press President Barack Obama and Congress to develop a plan to counter gun violence. Kaleka spoke in a one-minute video posted on Demand a Plan’s website on Dec. 17, 2012 -- two months after three people were shot to death at a suburban Milwaukee salon and three days after 26 people were gunned down at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn. He ended his plea by saying: "Every day, 34 Americans are murdered with guns. That’s 48,000 Americans murdered with guns during President Obama’s next term. I need to know what our leaders are going to do to stop the gun violence. I demand a plan." Let’s check the 34 Americans murdered figure, a statistic repeated by Kaleka’s brother, Amardeep Kaleka, in his own video on the website. Shootings spurred campaign The shooting at the Sikh temple, located in the Milwaukee suburb of Oak Creek, is one of at least 62 mass shootings in the U.S. in the past 30 years, according to a December 2012 article in Mother Jones. Most of the killers were mentally ill and obtained their guns legally, the liberal magazine reported. Demand a Plan was launched in July 2012 after 12 people were shot dead earlier that month at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo. The sponsor of the campaign is Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a national group that includes Oak Creek Mayor Steve Scaffidi and Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett. The mayors group, headed by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino, backs legislation that would, among other things, require every gun buyer to pass a criminal background check; and ban military-style weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines. Similar claim checked The claim Kaleka makes in his video was also made in December 2012 by Democrat Cory Booker, the mayor of Newark, N.J., on ABC's "This Week with George Stephanapoulos." PolitiFact New Jersey rated it Mostly True. Our colleagues found that, between 2005 and 2009, an average of 34 Americans were killed by guns each day. The figure, which doesn't include suicides or accidents, is from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But more recent figures from the CDC, which tracks the causes of deaths for U.S. residents, had been released in September 2012. The newer figures show that, for 2006 through 2010, the five-year rolling average for gun homicides dropped to 33. In 2010 alone, there were 31,672 gun-related deaths, including 19,392 suicides and 11,078 homicides. The remaining deaths were classified as unintentional (606), undetermined (252), or legal intervention/war (344). PolitiFact New Jersey also pointed out that, on an annual basis, the gun homicide figure is dropping. An average of 30 people were killed in 2010 and the preliminary figure for 2011 is also 30. That's down from the average of 35 in 2006, the highest year of the decade. Erika Soto Lamb, a spokeswoman for Demand a Plan, told us the number of gun homicides might be declining because of improvements in medical care have resulted in more lives being saved. She cited a December 2012 news article in The Wall Street Journal. The article said that the number of people shot in the U.S. is increasing, but the percentage who die is decreasing. The article quoted experts as saying improvement in medical care is a major factor in the decline in gun homicides. Our rating As part of a national campaign to address gun violence, Pardeep Kaleka, the son of a Wisconsin gun homicide victim, said: "Every day, 34 Americans are murdered with guns." The average for 2010, the most recent year for which complete figures are available, was 30. But the latest rolling five-year average, the type of measure Kaleka used, was 33, slightly less than what Kaleka claimed. We rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-11558	"First NFL team declares bankruptcy over kneeling thugs."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/feb/07/blog-posting/no-jaguars-nfl-team-didnt-declare-bankruptcy-after/	Taking a knee in protest during the national anthem has led the Jacksonville Jaguars NFL team to bankruptcy, a fake viral post on Facebook said. "First NFL team declares bankruptcy over kneeling thugs," said a Feb. 2 headline on TopBuzz, an open platform where anyone can post articles and videos. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found that there is no evidence that the Jaguars plan to file for bankruptcy as a result of players taking a knee during the national anthem to protest police brutality or injustice against African-Americans. The fact-checking website Snopes found that the same story was posted by Patriot Post, a satirical website, on Dec. 3. The article has since been posted by many other websites including Defense USA, Santa Christmas and Policetask. The Feb. 2 story said that "last week" 31 of 42 men on the Jaguars took a knee during the national anthem. (The Jaguars’ schedule shows their last game was Jan. 21, so technically they didn’t play the week before Feb. 2.) The players angered "every God-fearing, country-loving American who has either had the honor to serve or know someone who did. They might as well have wiped their proverbial asses with the American flag," the story said. The story said that the Jaguars were "quietly maneuvering behind the scenes to file a Chapter 11 reorganization of debt bankruptcy in the 3rd District Court of Atlanta next week." We found no such court in Atlanta, and we found there is a bankruptcy court much closer to home: the Florida Middle Bankruptcy Court in Jacksonville. We searched news reports and found nothing about the Jaguars moving toward bankruptcy. Forbes valued the Jaguars at about $2 billion, in 25th place, in it’s 2017 ranking of the value of NFL teams. The controversy about football players’ silent protests began in 2016, when then-NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick initially sat, and later switched to taking a knee, during the pre-game anthem to protest racial discrimination, especially at the hands of police. Those protests became even more politicized after President Donald Trump tweeted Sept. 23, 2017 that any such players who don’t stand during the national anthem should be fired. The next day, dozens of NFL players nationwide took a knee in protest, including some Jaguars players during their game in London. The Jaguars drew particular attention because their owner, Shahid Khan, a Pakistan-born Muslim and only nonwhite NFL owner, publicly showed his support for the protests. Khan joined his team on the field and locked arms to show solidarity during the game. "We have a lot of work to do and we can do it, but the comments made by the president make it harder," Khan said in a statement. "That's why it was important for us, and personally for me, to show the world that even if we may differ at times, we can and should be united in the effort to become better as people and a nation." Khan had donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration but has also criticized Trump’s attempt to ban immigrants from predominantly Muslim countries. We emailed the Jaguars’ public relations office and did not get a reply. The protests by NFL players have fueled multiple fake news stories including that a flight crew took a knee and stranded the New Orleans Saints on an airport runway, and that the NFL fined Pittsburgh Steelers $1 million each for skipping national anthem and that Fox Sports cancelled NFL broadcasts.

pomt-03664	A recent study of a proposed cap-and-trade policy’s effect on Wisconsin consumers showed it could "raise gasoline prices by 141 percent and electricity rates by 171 percent" by 2030.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/apr/28/ron-johnson/ron-johnson-says-recent-study-showed-wisconsin-gas/	Ron Johnson described believers in man-made causes of climate change as "crazy" when he ran for U.S. Senate in 2010, saying that sunspot activity or "just something in the geologic eons of time" were more likely explanations for extreme weather. Now in his third year in the Senate, Johnson is markedly more diplomatic when responding to constituents who want him to support limits on greenhouse gas emissions. "Thank you for taking the time to contact me regarding cap-and-trade policies and climate change," he wrote to Greg Everett, a retired musician from Conover on March 26, 2013. "I share your desire to protect our natural environment." Still, Johnson sought to make clear to Everett -- who had signed a petition asking Johnson to support cap and trade -- his continued opposition to government intervention in this realm. "But I am equally concerned that misguided efforts to improve the environment can destroy much-needed jobs and new job creation," Johnson said in a response that Everett posted on his blog. "Too often, these policies become so prohibitively expensive that they undermine economic growth and the average American's ability to support himself or herself." Johnson then referred to "a recent study of a proposed cap-and-trade policy." The study, he wrote, "showed it would cost Wisconsin nearly 75,000 jobs by 2030 and result in a loss of disposable income of up to $6,900 per household. It could also raise gasoline prices by 141 percent and electricity rates by 171 percent." We’re aware there’s general agreement that cap-and-trade legislation carries a cost for most -- if not all -- consumers. But the numbers Johnson cites on gas and electric costs are eye-popping. Let’s take a look. How cap and trade works Generally speaking, cap and trade works like this: To slow climate change, the government would set a cap on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. To comply, companies such as electric utilities must either upgrade to cleaner technologies or buy credits — also known as allowances — to continue polluting. Companies that find ways to reduce pollution easily and cheaply can end up with extra credits, and sell them to other companies that have trouble reducing their emissions or want to make longer-term investments in conservation, according to a summary by the Environmental Defense Fund. While companies may exchange allowances, the overall limit on pollution remains in place. The cap would then be reduced over time to ratchet down greenhouse gas emissions. A lower cap aims to make it more costly for utilities and industries to continue burning fossil fuels. When we asked Johnson for backup, a spokesman in his office said the constituent response refers to a 2008 study commissioned by groups concerned about a cap-and-trade bill introduced in the Senate. The study does have numbers very close to what Johnson cited -- 141 and 177 percent increases, for gas and oil, solely because of the bill. The study broke out price effects for each state, as well as a national figure. But several things jumped out at us about the study. In predicting price effects over nearly 25 years, the study presents a range of low and high price-hike estimates, not single figures. The low-cost estimate for gasoline is 72 percent, half of the worst-case estimate. For electricity, the low end increase was 126 percent. Johnson mentions only the worst-case scenario, though he did frame it as prices "could" jump by the higher figures. The study was commissioned by two groups that have opposed legislative efforts on climate change on the same economic grounds that Johnson cites. They are the American Council for Capital Formation (ACCF) and National Association of Manufacturers (NAM). It is relatively recent, 2008, but it focused on a bill -- the Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act (S. 2191) -- first introduced in 2007. It was replaced by a companion bill in 2008, which died in the Senate. Neither got as much traction as a 2009 bill that passed the House. When we broadened our search, we found numerous impact studies by public and private entities on cap-and-trade legislation, and specifically on Lieberman-Warner. According to experts, all such efforts at forecasting energy price increases are iffy due to the complexity level. The cost projections on Lieberman-Warner are "at best speculative" and should be viewed skeptically, warned an exhaustive Congressional Research Service review of six studies. "It is difficult to project costs up to the year 2030, much less beyond. The already tenuous assumption that regulatory standards will remain constant becomes more unrealistic, and other unforeseen events loom as critical issues which cannot be modeled." Fuel price estimates, in particular, vary widely depending on various assumptions made by researchers, the review said. And the study for the manufacturing group -- cited by Johnson -- showed dramatically higher increases in gasoline prices than predicted in studies by two government agencies and a non-profit that supports cap and trade, the research service found. Gasoline: The Johnson-cited study projected hikes of $1.70 to $3.25 per gallon by 2030, while the federal government’s official source of energy statistics, the Energy Information Administration (EIA), predicted increases of 40 cents per gallon. The non-profit Clean Air Task Force put the hike at 25 cents. The figures compared are national, not specific to Wisconsin. Electricity: The Johnson-cited study predicted increases at least twice as high as studies by EIA, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Clean Air Task Force, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the National Mining Association. Again, the figures are national. The CRS specifically warned about breaking down cost impacts state by state -- as the manufacturers study did -- saying: "Simple attempts by some presentations to break down the cost by industrial sector or by state should be viewed with attentive skepticism." Overall, the service found, "the more comprehensive analyses are the work by EPA, EIA, and MIT." Another bill, another study The two groups behind the study Johnson relied on also did a separate projection of the Wisconsin energy cost impact of a more recent bill -- the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 sponsored by U.S. Reps. Henry Waxman and Edward Markey. The Waxman-Markey bill, unlike Lieberman-Warner, passed the House 219-212 on June 26, 2009. It did not get a Senate vote. Its impact was studied in 2009. In that study, the two groups projected much smaller price increases from Waxman-Markey (19.9 percent to 26.1 percent for gas, and 37.5 percent to 59.7 percent for electric)than from the bill Johnson chose to highlight (increases well over 100 percent). That’s likely because Waxman-Markey rolled some of the revenue from pollution permits back to consumers in the form of rebates or expanded efficiency programs. Johnson spokesman Brian Faughnan told us Johnson’s climate change letter was simply an attempt to show the reasonable possible impact of major legislation that started in the Senate, the chamber where he serves. "Senator Johnson’s letter does not claim to give a full range of the estimates of the impact of cap and trade," Faughnan wrote in an email to us. And in any event, the two studies by the manufacturers show major increases in gas prices, and significantly greater electricity costs, Faughnan wrote. Our rating Experts agree that cap and trade likely means higher energy costs for consumers. Johnson goes further, saying it would be "prohibitively expensive." He tells constituents he opposes it in part because a "recent study" showed it could "raise gasoline prices by 141 percent and electricity rates by 171 percent." There is a study that includes those estimates for Wisconsin. But Johnson ignores critical facts. The same study cites much smaller increases under a second scenario. And its conclusions, published by opponents of the bill, are an outlier among several other studies that independent congressional researchers say were more thorough -- and show much smaller increases. He also ignores studies that said a more recent bill dramatically held down the size of cost increases to consumers. In an area in which precise conclusions are difficult, Johnson cherry-picks one study of a dead bill and presents its worst-case scenario as hard evidence of "prohibitively expensive" effects of a cap and trade approach.

pomt-11456	"The Koch brothers have given" Paul Ryan "$500,000 in campaign contributions."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/mar/09/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-stumping-paul-ryan-opponent-randy-b/	At or near the top of liberals’ love-to-hate list are "the Koch brothers" -- billionaire industrialists and funders of conservative causes, Charles and David Koch. U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders took a swipe at them with an eye-popping statement about campaign cash during his most recent visit to Wisconsin. The Vermont independent, who won the Badger State during his 2016 bid for the Democratic nomination for president, was keynoting a Feb. 24, 2018 rally in Racine for Randy Bryce. Bryce is one of two Democrats running for the southern Wisconsin congressional seat held by Republican U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan. Ryan, who was first elected to the seat in 1998, has repeatedly said he won’t decide until spring whether he’ll run for re-election in November 2018. Sanders said: And this particular election could not be clearer in terms of the competing visions for America. It is not an accident that Paul Ryan now has, I think, $10 million in his campaign war chest. It is not an accident that the Koch brothers have given him $500,000 in campaign contributions. It had been reported a month before Sanders’ visit that Ryan had $10 million in cash on hand in his campaign account as of the end of 2017. But did $500,000 of it come from the Koch brothers? It may not seem like it sometimes, but there are still limits on how much individuals can give to candidates. We found Sanders’ claim is partially accurate, but takes things out of context. The money To back Sanders’ claim, his campaign directed us to page 364 of a January 2018 Federal Election Commission report filed by something called Team Ryan. The report shows that in November 2017, Team Ryan received $247,700 each from Charles Koch and his wife, Elizabeth Koch, of Wichita, Kan. That’s a total of almost $500,000 ($495,400). But were those campaign contributions given to Ryan? Not exactly. To ‘Ryan’ Team Ryan is a joint fundraising committee that raises and transfers money to three groups: 1. Ryan for Congress -- that is, Ryan’s own campaign fund. 2. Prosperity Action, a leadership political action committee run by Ryan that gives money to other politicians. 3. National Republican Congressional Committee, the campaign arm for House Republicans. In disputing Sanders’ claim, Ryan’s campaign said the vast majority of the Koch money goes to the National Republican Congressional Committee, given that there are federal limits on what an individual can give to Ryan’s campaign ($5,400 per election cycle) and to Ryan’s leadership PAC ($5,000 per calendar year). Campaign finance experts from three nonprofits, the Center for Responsive Politics, the Campaign Finance Institute and Common Cause, confirmed to us that those limits apply to the Koch donations. That means the $495,400 in Koch money to Team Ryan would break down this way: Ryan’s campaign $10,800 Ryan’s leadership PAC $10,000 National Republican Congressional Committee $474,600 Two points worth noting as we close: 1. Team Ryan raised $44 million in 2017, a record for a House speaker in a non-election year. In announcing the $44 million in January 2018, Team Ryan said it would be transferring $32 million to the NRCC. 2. The contributions by Charles and Elizabeth Koch were made 13 days after the House passed the Ryan-backed GOP tax reform that was signed into law by President Donald Trump. Both Charles and David Koch were major advocates for the tax plan, which cuts the corporate tax rate and estate taxes. Our rating At a campaign rally for one of the candidates running for Ryan’s U.S. House seat, Sanders said "the Koch brothers have given" Ryan "$500,000 in campaign contributions." It wasn’t the two Koch brothers but rather one of the brothers, and his wife, who contributed $495,400. The money was given to a joint fundraising committee controlled by Ryan. But it primarily funds campaigns of other Republicans because, by law, only $10,800 could go to Ryan’s own campaign fund. We rate Sanders’ statement Half True.

pomt-02487	"When union membership goes down, so do (middle class) wages."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/feb/18/ed-schultz/schultz-go-unions-so-go-wages/	In the days before workers rejected an attempt to unionize a Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., MSNBC host and union supporter Ed Schultz attempted to underscore what he thought was at stake. "If it fails, it could be a major setback for workers all across this country," Schultz told viewers. Schultz then pointed to a chart showing two lines that headed down over time. One was the percentage of union workers and the other was, in his words, "middle class income." "Quite the parallel there, isn’t there?" Schultz said. "When union membership goes down, so do wages. This vote is a pivotal moment for union workers in this country." Schultz, who did not respond to our requests for comment, is right to point out that union membership affects wages. But his wording takes things a little too far. We’ll explain why in this fact-check. How unions affect wages We found the chart that Schultz had on his show. It comes from the Center for American Progress, a liberal advocacy group, and shows the percentage of union workers falling from about 28 percent in 1967 to about 11 percent today. In the same period, the share of the nation’s income going to the middle 60 percent of households declined from 52.3 percent to 45.7 percent. That seems to support Schultz’s claim, but actually it doesn’t prove his point. First, he talked about wages and the chart talks about the share of the national income, which is different. One is money in your pocket and the other is money in your pocket compared to the money in rich peoples’ pockets. In fact, according to the Pew Research Center, a reliable source of neutral number crunching, household median income rose between 1967 and 2012 by about $7,000 after accounting for inflation. If you want to find the strongest evidence for Schultz’s statement, you have to look at the wages for men. Work by economists Michael Greenstone and Adam Looney finds median wages for men slipped slightly starting in 1970 and have remained stagnant ever since. But while wages and union membership might have fallen (or flatlined) at the same time, it doesn’t mean one caused the other. That’s where independent research picks up. Most analysts have looked at Schultz’s claim from another angle, by seeing if unions raise wages. The research shows generally, yes. We found near consensus that unions tend to deliver higher pay for their members. "Unions raise wages for people in the middle of the skills distribution about 10 to 15 percent," said David Card, one of the leading economists in this field at the University of California-Berkeley. Card’s work is full of daunting equations and statistical techniques, but within those, he teases out the role a person’s skill level plays. Card has found that people with higher skills are less inclined to join unions and that union employers tend to avoid lower-skilled workers. That means the biggest impacts of unions are felt among people in the middle. Another leading researcher, David Macpherson at Trinity University, uses data from the federal government’s Current Population Survey to produce a database called Unionstats.com. In the latest numbers for 2013, Macpherson finds unions play a larger role in shaping wages in the private sector than in the government sector. "The union premium is about 20 percent in the private sector," Macpherson said. "While in the public sector, it’s about 9 percent." Any number, however, has caveats and is imprecise, economists told us. They point to holes in the data and the challenge of separating the impact of unions compared to other macroeconomic forces, such as global competition. There’s also evidence the union effect has dropped over time. Still, according to the experts we reached, unions are good for their members. For the record, economist John DiNardo at the University of Michigan studied companies where unionization votes -- both for and against -- were very close. DiNardo found that it didn’t really matter whether workers approved or rejected unions. Wages in both kinds of companies followed the same path. Where Schultz goes too far So there is broad consensus that unions are typically good for people who join them in that it results in increased wages. But Schultz’s claim was broader than that. He said that when union membership goes down, people not only lose the potential to earn more -- their wages drop. And that happens regardless of whether you had the chance to join a union or not. That’s a trickier claim to substantiate, but there are some theories on how that could happen. Labor economist Richard Freeman at Harvard University speaks of the "threat effect", that is, when non-union employers raise wages to avoid a successful union vote by their workers. Freeman found evidence of companies raising wages to undermine union growth in the 1950s and 1960s when unions were strong. But today is a different story, he said. "To go from those situations and show they affect the whole economy is a stretch," Freeman said. "Schultz's claim is plausible, and it may be right, but we don't really know the magnitude of the spillover." Other powerful forces are also at play, Freeman said. Global competition and much greater use of technology hurt some workers and helped others. There is no consensus on the role unions by themselves played over the decades. On one end, there is the work of Macpherson and his colleagues. Macpherson looked at how much of the nation’s total income went to workers since the mid 1960s. It has gone up a bit and down a bit, but generally it held steady even as the percentage of union workers fell. "I don’t see any evidence that wages across the board went down as union membership declined," Macpherson said. But Macpherson’s data didn’t look at the distribution of those wages. A CEO’s pay was mixed in with that of a store clerk. Other researchers have focused on how pay is spread around. Sociologists Jake Rosenfeld at the University of Washington and Bruce Western at Harvard concluded that men who work full-time would be doing appreciably better if union membership hadn’t fallen since the 1970s. How much better? Rosenfeld said if more men -- again, it’s the male workers -- had belonged to unions, their yearly wages would have increased about $2,600. Card at the University of California had similar results. "The decline in unionization has reduced wages for people in the middle relative to those in the top," Card said. Setting aside the matter of unions and income inequality, here is one point on which Rosenfeld, Macpherson and Freeman generally agree. The impact of unions depends heavily on the nature of the work and where it takes place. When unions are strong in a particular industry and a particular region, Rosenfeld said it raises the bar and non-union managers tend to mimic their neighbors. "If that (other) firm happens to be union, then you're paying union-level wages regardless of whether your company is organized," Rosenfeld said. "Was Ed Schultz right to say that 'when union membership goes down, so do wages?' " Rosenfeld said. "Sure -- for union members and for those non-members who worked in areas and occupations where labor was strong. For everyone across the whole economy? Probably not." Our ruling Schultz said when union membership goes down, so do wages. Schultz emphasized that "all workers" have a stake in this and his chart tied union membership to the income of everyone in the middle class. Schultz would have done better to have talked about the distribution of income rather than wages. His claim is most likely to be true for male union workers and only partly true for non-union workers. Even for union workers, other factors such as globalization and technology have diminished the union effect. The ability of unions to push up wages for workers outside the union is limited to certain industries that operate in the same region. Schultz’s statement has a measure of truth but in today’s economy, the data don’t support the strong tie he suggests between unions and wages overall. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-02729	"Florida has experienced positive job growth for 39 consecutive months."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/dec/19/republican-party-florida/nod-rick-scott-republican-party-says-florida-had-3/	After a recent Miami Herald/Tampa Bay Times investigation revealed that state incentives have so far only led to a tiny sliver of promised jobs, Gov. Rick Scott and the Republican Party of Florida decided to fight back with their own job statistics. "Florida has experienced positive job growth for 39 consecutive months," the Republican Party of Florida posted on Facebook this month. The claim seemed odd to us, since 39 months would include part of former Gov. Charlie Crist’s term. We wanted to dig further. Florida job statistics currently are available through October 2013, meaning Scott has been in office for 34 months where figures are available. In that time, Florida has gained jobs in 29 months and lost jobs in five months -- including as recently as May. That means Florida has added jobs for five consecutive months, according to federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, not 39. Case closed? Not entirely. The state Republican Party told us it didn’t mean "consecutive" as in month after month. Instead, Republicans said they were comparing each month to the same month the previous year -- so October 2012 vs. October 2013, etc. By that measure, Florida has had 39 months of positive job growth. According to the Bureau of Labor statistics, the last month that saw a decline in the total number of people employed compared to the same month the previous year was July 2010. We turned to economists to see what they thought of the GOP’s wording and approach. They said the GOP was misleading in its wording but that one measure of job growth isn’t necessarily better than the other. Chris Lafakis, a senior economist at Moody’s and Bill Seyfried, an economist at Rollins College in Florida, told us it can be more useful to look at trends over a few months in a row. "For example, In March and April of 2013, the Florida economy added about 25,000 and 19,000 jobs, respectively," Seyfried said. "There were about 5,000 fewer jobs in May but then about 36,000 jobs added over the next two months. As an economist, I view May as the outlier given solid employment gains in the two months before and two months afterwards. I wouldn’t extend that to 12 months, but normally would focus on the three-month average (as opposed to just one month at a time)." Gary Burtless, an economist at Brookings, said that most readers would have misinterpreted the Republican Party’s statement to refer to one month followed by the next month. "Employment has generally increased over the past 39 months," he said. But "it simply hasn't increased for 39 consecutive months." Retired University of Florida economics professor David Denslow agreed. The GOP "should have said, Florida has experienced positive year-over-year job growth for 39 consecutive months,’ " Denslow said. Our ruling The Republican Party of Florida said "Florida has experienced positive job growth for 39 consecutive months." Economists say the state GOP is guilty of sloppy wording here. Florida has not experienced 39 consecutive months of job growth. The correct figure is five. But there is a sliver of truth if you look at the claim through the GOP’s eyes. Florida has seen year-over-year job growth for 39 consecutive months, which while not what Republicans said, is an equally notable metric. Words matter. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-03340	The city of Brookhaven’s ordinance could cause the Pink Pony to close, thereby "putting 300 Pink Pony employees out of work in this economy."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/jul/22/pink-pony/pink-pony-ad-warns-fight-could-cost-jobs/	We couldn’t resist. The folks who run the Pink Pony Gentlemen’s Club recently paid for an ad in a community newspaper claiming several hundred people would be unemployed if a city of Brookhaven ordinance forced the strip club to shut its doors. Dancers. Bartenders. Even "house moms." We’ll get to the house moms in a minute. "FACT," the ad says in red letters. The ad said the city’s ordinance would put "300 Pink Pony employees out of work in this economy." A colleague saw the ad in a DeKalb County newspaper and forwarded it to us. The ad included a prior fact check we wrote looking into the Pink Pony’s claim that management has never been cited for a violation of a state law or ordinance. That one was rated True. We at PolitiFact Georgia are typically digging into technical topics and slogging through long reports; so we virtually danced (with our clothes on) at another opportunity to fact-check a claim by the club. Does the Pink Pony really employ 300 people? "Three hundred might be a conservative number," said Aubrey Villines, an attorney who specializes in First Amendment issues who represents the club. In May, the Pink Pony filed a lawsuit against the DeKalb County municipality claiming Brookhaven’s ordinance to regulate sexually oriented businesses would put the club out of business. Specifically, the ordinance would prohibit nude dancing, with or without serving alcohol. The city has said it will not enforce the ordinance until a DeKalb County Superior Court judge rules on its legality. The lawsuit is serious business, Villines says. The Pink Pony claims Brookhaven would lose $450,000 a year in property and sales taxes, along with license and permit fees. It’s also a big deal for Brookhaven taxpayers, who are paying legal fees associated with the lawsuit. There’s been plenty of news coverage over the years about how the strip club business has made it rain with greenbacks in Atlanta. (See: The Gold Club, Adam "Pacman" Jones.) Cab drivers, food delivery workers, they all make money off the Pink Pony, Villines said. "If we leave that area (of Brookhaven), it will cave under," Villines said, stressing that was the main point of the ad. Villines estimated the Pink Pony employs about 200 dancers. Some work there a couple of days a week, he said. Others, he said, work as many as five days a week. There’s the bartending staff, servers, the kitchen crew, security, disc jockeys, the janitorial staff. And, yes, house moms. House moms, Villines explained, are women who help dancers if they encounter work-related trouble, such as a flat tire en route to the Pony. Their duties include making sure the dancers don’t drive home under the influence. "They’re the first line of defense," Villines said of house moms. The Pink Pony, though, wouldn’t show us any proof that they have 300 people on the payroll. They couldn’t reveal that sort of information, Villines said. DeKalb County, though, requires strip club dancers, waitresses, bartenders and bouncers to get an annual license to work at adult entertainment establishments. The dancers pay $300 a year; the other occupations pay $200 a year. As of July 18, there were 352 men and women licensed to work at the Pink Pony, county records show. The records do not show each employee is currently working there. So, there are more than 300 people currently licensed to work at the club, which is more than what the Pink Pony claimed in its ad. Still, we don’t know if all of them are regularly working there. Do the majority of the 200 or so dancers work two days a week? Once every two months? The Pink Pony claim is partially accurate, but it ignores a lot of context that would give a reader a different impression. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-08903	"I don't think the argument can be credibly made that the United States of America is undertaxed compared to our competitors."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/29/tim-pawlenty/tim-pawlenty-says-us-not-undertaxed-compared-its-c/	Tim Pawlenty -- Minnesota's outgoing Republican governor and a likely candidate for president in 2012 -- met with Washington reporters on July 26, 2010, for a wide-ranging discussion of politics and policy. One of the things he said made it into the reports of at least two journalists in attendance, Ruth Marcus of the Washington Post and John Dickerson of Slate.. Asked what his reaction would be if a presidential commission on the national debt were to recommend a mix of spending cuts and tax increases, Pawlenty said, "Not good. I don't think the argument can be credibly made that the United States of America is undertaxed compared to our competitors." In an opinion column published the following day, Marcus took aim at Pawlenty's remark. "Actually," Marcus wrote, "the United States is on the low end in terms of the overall tax burden -- 28 percent of gross domestic product in 2007, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, compared with an average of 36 percent in the 30 OECD countries. Only South Korea, Mexico and Turkey were lower." By locating the OECD chart -- which is exactly what we would have done -- Marcus ably did much of our work for us. But we still wanted to check with a few tax experts to make sure that she didn't miss anything in her analysis. Three experts we queried -- Daniel J. Mitchell, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, William Ahern, the director of policy and communications at the Tax Foundation, a tax research group, and Dean Baker, co-director of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research -- all agreed with Marcus's conclusion, though Ahern and Mitchell took the opportunity to add some additional context. Ahern said that tax-burden-to-GDP ratios -- the data that underlies the OECD chart -- should be used carefully because they can obscure deficits. A country with a low tax-to-GDP ratio may have a substantial deficit, and in time, that deficit will put upward pressure on taxes. So nations with low tax-to-GDP ratios may not find those ratios sustainable over the long term. Mitchell, for his part, agreed with Marcus' point about the overall tax burden, but he noted that in the U.S., the burden from different types of taxes varies. Some types of taxes, such as corporate taxes, are among the highest of the OECD nations. Others are closer to average, such as the top income tax rate and the capital gains tax rate. "The big reason the U.S. has a lower aggregate tax burden when measured as a share of GDP is that we don't -- yet -- have a value-added tax," Mitchell said. "Our payroll taxes also tend to be lower than average." Indeed, when we contacted Pawlenty's camp, a spokesman cited the high rates of corporate taxes in the U.S. "This unacceptably high corporate tax rate makes the U.S. less competitive by encouraging companies to shift investment to nations with lower corporate tax rates," said spokesman Alex Conant. Despite the caveats from our experts, we see no reason to undercut Marcus' finding that the U.S. ranks low among other developed countries in total tax burden. Corporate taxes are comparatively high in the U.S., and that's a worry for businesses and, indirectly, for their employees and customers. But corporate taxes only accounted for 12 percent of federal tax revenues in 2008, so we don't think it's valid to focus on that factor to the exclusion of the broader tax burden.

pomt-13570	"22 veterans take their own lives each day."	mostly true	/california/statements/2016/aug/23/kamala-harris/kamala-harris-slightly-claim-about-veterans-suicid/	In her campaign for U.S. Senate, California Attorney General Kamala Harris has pledged to "clean up" the scandals and reduce wait times at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. The issue, Harris has said, is a matter of life and death. "It is unconscionable that 22 veterans take their own lives each day. We must ensure that they have support to adjust to civilian life," Harris, a Democrat, said on Twitter on August 18, 2016. Harris made the same claim about veterans suicides on her website here, where she adds that she’ll work "to ensure that every Veteran knows what benefits they earned and how to access those benefits." We wondered whether the suicide statistic Harris used is correct. Checking a somber number Her campaign spokesman said Harris used a widely-cited figure of 22 suicides per day from the VA’s 2012 Suicide Data Report, which examined veterans deaths in 21 states, from 1999 to 2011. That study’s researchers, as noted by the Washington Post Fact Checker, cautioned against the use of the 22-deaths figure more than once in the study: "It is recommended that the estimated number of veterans be interpreted with caution due to the use of data from a sample of states." Researchers gave a range of 18 to 22 veteran suicides a day. Harris chose the high-end of this range. Importantly, Harris’ figure of 22 suicides per day fails to account for research the VA released in July for its most comprehensive report yet on veteran suicides. The VA examined about 55 million veterans records from 1979 through 2014. It found that in 2014, the latest year for which figures are available, 7,403 veterans took their own lives, or an average of about 20 a day. That’s close to the 22 suicides per day cited by Harris, a figure that continues to be used by many others despite the new, more extensive research. It does not take away from the point Harris is trying to make: That the rate of veterans suicide is far too high. VA figures show that in 2014 veterans accounted for 18 percent of all deaths from suicides among adults in the United States while they made up only 8.5 percent of the population. Capital Public Radio / File photo One prominent voice in American politics has cited the new number. PolitiFact Virginia rated a claim by Donald Trump in July that "a shocking 20 veterans are committing suicide each and every day, especially our older veterans," as True, based on this new report. PolitiFact Virginia added that the VA always acknowledged that this old study (from 2012) was limited. Notably absent were records for California and Texas — two states with very high veteran populations. The new figure of 20 veteran suicides a day is based on records from every state. When asked, Harris’ campaign spokesman acknowledged there has been new research. "Kamala believes strongly we must work hard to get that number to zero," the spokesman added. Old study widely cited Harris is not the only person to cite the 22 suicides per day statistic from the old study. Her opponent and fellow Democrat in the race for U.S. Senate — U.S. Representative Loretta Sanchez — has repeated it, including in this video posted in November 2015. Our ruling Kamala Harris recently said "22 veterans take their own lives each day." The number she cites relies on data from a 2012 VA study by the VA, which was limited and included caveats. That old report has been widely cited by Republicans and Democrats, including Harris’ opponent in her run for U.S. Senate. But Harris’ claim ignores research the VA released in July for its most comprehensive report yet on veteran suicides, with records from all states. The new study found an average of about 20 veterans a day, two fewer than what Harris claimed. Harris’ statement is close, but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-11817	"Since 2015, Scott Walker has not done a public event where you don't have to pay admission or be on an approved list."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/nov/15/scot-ross/how-often-does-gov-scott-walker-seeking-re-electio/	Gov. Scott Walker has repeatedly been criticized for not being accessible to the general public. In 2013, state Sen. Chris Larson, D-Milwaukee, went extreme, saying Walker "hasn't done a public event this entire year." That rated Pants on Fire. We noted a number of events, such as a Martin Luther King Jr. ceremony in the Capitol rotunda attended by hundreds of people (including a few who booed during Walker’s remarks). In 2016, we rated as True a much narrower statement from state Rep. Dana Wachs, D-Eau Claire, that Walker's "listening sessions" were "invite-only and excluding the press." As he traveled Wisconsin to meet with residents, Walker asked various people, including Democratic lawmakers, for suggestions on who to invite to his listening sessions. But these events -- held by Walker, rather than him attending events staged by others -- were not open to the public or to the press, only to people who were invited. Now the 2018 campaign for governor is in full swing, with Wachs among seven Democrats hoping to challenge Walker. And the attacks on Walker’s accessibility are returning. On Nov. 3, 2017, Scot Ross, executive director of the liberal advocacy group One Wisconsin Now, was interviewed on "The Devil’s Advocates," a liberal radio talk show based in Milwaukee. During a discussion about Walker, host Mike Crute said the governor doesn’t often meet with the general public, "not unless they’re invited, not unless they own a corporation. What about the town hall meetings or lack thereof, Scot?" Ross replied: No, I mean, since 2015, Scott Walker has not done a public event where you don't have to pay admission or be on an approved list. I mean, it is disgraceful, this guy -- I mean since 2015, we’re talking two years you have not been able to go to a Scott Walker event unless you open your checkbook or your organization is a lobbying firm and they open their checkbook. As we’ll see, Walker does attend events held by others that are open to the public, but at events he stages, access is more limited. Ross’ evidence When we asked Ross to back his statement, he reiterated that he was referring to events Walker hosts, not events held by others that Walker attends. He made these points: "The closest you can find to Walker attending events that the public can attend without paying or being on a list were the holiday tree lighting ceremony … and his attendance at the last two Martin Luther King Day Jr. celebrations as a guest of the organizers." "Walker doesn't release his schedule publicly." "Even Walker's re-election events have all been held at private businesses that do not allow the public to attend." In July 2016, One Wisconsin Now said it had analyzed campaign contributions of people attending Walker listening sessions during the first three months of the year, and they had made nearly 4,000 contributions totaling over $1 million, overwhelmingly to Republicans and conservatives. Walker’s response In response, Walker’s campaign cited these events attended by Walker: Holiday events: Attending the 2017 Memorial Day ceremony at Wood National Cemetery in Milwaukee and participating in Fourth of July parades, such as the ones in Wauwatosa and in Menomonee Falls in 2017. Other events not organized by Walker: Participating in events such as the first lady’s walk, Special Olympics torch run, ceremonies honoring law enforcement officers, groundbreakings and ribbon cuttings. Re-election tour: At 14 campaign announcement events around the state in 2017, people were asked to register ahead of time, but were not turned away if they hadn’t, according to the campaign. Walker’s campaign also cited a 9/11 event cosponsored by the governor's office and a September 2016 news event in Madison, noting Ross attended, in which Walker made an announcement about refinancing student debt. Ross said he heard secondhand about the event, at a UW Credit Union, and that it was not generally known or accessible to the public. Our rating Ross said: "Since 2015, Scott Walker has not done a public event where you don't have to pay an admission or be on an approved list." It’s pretty clear that access to Walker is limited. His schedule is generally not made public ahead of time, making it difficult for people to go to events he attends. There are events that are open to the public, such as holiday ceremonies, that Walker attends. But in terms of events Walker himself holds, his campaign team cited campaign events at which registration is requested but not required, a 9/11 ceremony that the governor's office co-sponsored and a news event that had not been announced to the general public. For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True. Editor's note: This article was edited on Nov. 17, 2017 to indicate that a 9/11 ceremony was co-sponsored by the governor's office and to make clear that registration was requested but not required at Walker campaign announcement events.

pomt-13303	Says he has "a fiduciary responsibility to his business, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/09/donald-trump/donald-trump-has-no-fiduciary-responsibility-his-p/	In response to a New York Times article dissecting leaked pages from his tax returns, Donald Trump’s presidential campaign released a statement that sought to justify Trump’s efforts to keep his personal income taxes low. The Times article followed months of refusal by Trump to release his tax returns, something that all presidential candidates since 1980 have done. The paper reported that a $916 million loss could have enabled Trump to cancel out earned income in other years, enough to legally pay no personal federal income tax for up to 18 years. The Trump campaign’s unsigned statement argued in part that Trump had an obligation to pay the lowest amount of taxes possible. "Mr. Trump is a highly skilled businessman who has a fiduciary responsibility to his business, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required,’ the statement said in part. But does Trump have a "fiduciary responsibility" to pay as little as possible in personal income taxes? Most experts agreed that no such responsibility exists. (Trump’s campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) Let’s start with defining what "fiduciary responsibility" means. The most basic definition of fiduciary responsibility is a legal obligation of one party to act in the best interests of another. (There are other types of fiduciary relationships than economic ones -- such as attorneys to their clients, priests to their parishioners and doctors to their patients -- but we’ll set those aside here.) In a business setting, fiduciary obligation most often refers to the principle that a company’s management has a responsibility to act in the best interests of those who own the company -- its stockholders. There’s some disagreement about how this principle should be put into practice -- for instance, should a company maximize its short-term income regardless of the risks that doing so could carry for the long-term success of the company? In general, though, the overarching principle is considered fairly straightforward: A company’s manager is under an obligation to put shareholders’ interests ahead of his or her own personal financial interests. This principle is commonly followed in the business world. But most experts we contacted said that while the fiduciary principle would govern how a company pays its taxes, it would not apply to Trump’s personal tax return. "The general view is that corporate law imposes a fiduciary responsibility on company managers to maximize company profits on behalf of the company’s owners," said Dennis Caplan, associate professor of accounting at the University at Albany. That means that if Trump managed a company owned by others, he’d have an obligation to minimize corporate taxes in order to maximize profits, he said. But that’s not the case for personal income tax returns -- and it is those returns that were leaked to the New York Times and that were the subject of the speculation about 18 tax-free years. "I do not see how the taxes on his personal tax return would be relevant with respect to this particular fiduciary responsibility," Caplan said. Other experts agreed. Richard W. Painter, a University of Minnesota corporate law professor who was previously chief ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, told PolitiFact that "one does not have fiduciary duty to other people, except perhaps a joint-filing spouse, when filing personal tax returns." Painter added that there is also "no such thing" as a fiduciary duty to oneself. "That’s called greed," he put it in an interview with the New York Times. "And greed is not a component of the law of fiduciary duty anywhere." The fiduciary responsibility argument is something that Trump is "making up," said Daniel Shaviro, a professor of taxation at New York University Law School. "No such responsibility would extend to his personal taxes, even if he were the CEO of a publicly traded company," he said. There’s a difference between tax evasion, which is illegal, and tax avoidance, which is legal, said Charles Elson, director of the University of Delaware's John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance. He suspects that Trump was trying to echo this old piece of wisdom, but not successfully. The statement was not done in the "most artfully crafted" way, Elson said. At most, Trump might be able to argue that he has some fiduciary obligations to his employees, suggested Lawrence White, a professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business. That would be arguable "to the extent that any bankruptcy -- which might have arisen if he had not availed himself of these loss carry-forward/carry-back opportunities -- would have converted them into unsecured claimants for any delayed wages or other benefits," White said. However, that’s a "novel" argument untested in the courts, said University of Chicago Law School professor Daniel Hemel, writing in a Medium post. "Employers generally have no fiduciary duties to their employees," Hemel wrote. Our ruling The statement from Trump’s campaign said he has "a fiduciary responsibility to his business, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required." That might have been a credible argument if he were referring to his companies’ tax returns. But the statement was in response to controversy surrounding Trump’s personal tax returns. Experts we contacted said there is no generally accepted fiduciary obligation keep one’s own taxes low. The statement is not accurate.

pomt-11848	Says "FBI and Texas State Police are both confirming that Raymond Peter Littleberry, the man accused of shooting up a Texas church, was an avid atheist on the payroll of the Democrat National Committee."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/06/freedomjunkshuncom/no-texas-church-shooter-was-not-dnc-payroll-s-fake/	Fake news bloggers have seized on the mass shooting at a Texas church, which killed 26 and injured 20 others, to spread disinformation about the shooter’s identity and motive. Freedumjunkshun.com, a self-avowed fake news website, portrayed the perpetrator as a desperate Democratic activist whose killing spree at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, was motivated by atheism. "FBI and Texas State Police are both confirming that Raymond Peter Littleberry, the man accused of shooting up a Texas church, was an avid atheist on the payroll of the Democrat National Committee," the article claimed. The fake news article missed basic facts and fabricated others. It wrongly identified the alleged shooter as Raymond Peter Littleberry. Law enforcement officials identified the gunman as 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley. Some media reports quoted acquaintances of Kelley describing the man as an avowed atheist. But the fake news article’s claim that atheism motivated the attack was undercut by law enforcement officials who said religion was not a factor, and that the shooting appeared to stem from a "domestic situation." "There was a domestic situation going on with this family. The suspect's mother-in-law attended this church. We know that she had received threatening texts from him," Freeman Martin of the Texas Department of Public Safety told reporters in a Nov. 6 press conference. Martin added the shooting "wasn't over religious beliefs." The fake news article portrayed the perpetrator as "a liberal island in the middle of a conservative sea" who organized Black Lives Matter protests and gay pride parades. It noted that the shooter "was on the DNC payroll," in reference to the Democratic National Committee. "That’s completely false," DNC spokesman Michael Tyler told PolitiFact of the alleged connection. Freedumjunkshun aims to dupe conservative readers into mistaking its satire for truth. "Here we gather a boatload of bullhonkey, works of pure satirical fiction, to give the fist-shakers of the world a reason to hate," its disclaimer reads. "Reality is often in the eye of the beholder. You won’t find any of it here." The fake story was wrong to say that Kelley was on the DNC payroll, and authorities said his religious beliefs do not appear to have been a factor in the shooting.

pomt-06023	"In 1958, there were 16 states in this country that prohibited -- prohibited -- an African-American and a Caucasian from being married."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jan/15/sheila-oliver/sheila-oliver-says-16-states-prohibited-interracia/	Gay rights advocates are casting the fight for same-sex marriage as a struggle mirrored in the nation’s past. "This is a civil rights issue," Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver said during a news conference announcing Democratic plans to legalize same-sex marriage in New Jersey. Oliver recounted the story of an interracial couple forced to leave Virginia in the 1950s or face jail time for being married. The U.S. Supreme Court eventually heard Richard and Mildred Loving’s case and ruled state statutes banning interracial marriage unconstitutional. But, "in 1958, there were 16 states in this country that prohibited -- prohibited -- an African-American and a Caucasian from being married," Oliver (D-Essex) said on Jan. 9. "Without question, Senator (Stephen) Sweeney said it best: this is a civil rights issue. It is a snapshot in time in the history of our country issue. And I think for those of us that believe in equality, equality, equality, marriage equality represents the third leg on the stool of civil rights and equality in this country." A spokesman said Oliver based her statistic on a New York Times article published earlier this month. It put the number of states where interracial marriage was illegal in 1958 at 16. It’s actually more than that, PolitiFact New Jersey found. Oregon repealed its law in 1951, becoming the first state to do so since Ohio in 1887. Colorado, Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota followed suit. By 1958, two dozen states still prohibited interracial marriage: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming. Although California still technically had a miscegenation law on its books in 1958, "once the state Supreme Court declared the law invalid in the 1948 Perez V. Sharp case, it was no longer legally enforceable. So from 1948 on, California is put into the ‘legal column,’" Renee Romano, the author of "Race Mixing: Black-White Marriage in Postwar America" and an associate professor of history at Oberlin College in Ohio, said in an email. "The Speaker was responsibly relying upon the data graphic included in that New York Times [article]," Tom Hester Jr., a spokesman for the Assembly Democrats, wrote in an email. "The Speaker’s overall point was to note that same-sex couples continue to suffer from the same wrongful discrimination that interracial couples such as the Lovings and many, many others endured until the Supreme Court rightly put a stop to it." By the time the Supreme Court unanimously ruled miscegenation laws unconstitutional in 1967, 16 states still had such statutes. "Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual, and cannot be infringed by the State," then-Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote in the opinion for the court for the Loving v. Virginia case. Romano said the analogy between interracial marriage and same-sex marriage isn’t exactly parallel, but it’s powerful. If you can make the case that 50 years ago people supported bans on interracial marriage, but "now, we know that it goes on and it’s no big deal, you can sort of use that," she said, to say in another 50 years, people may ask "what the hullabaloo is about. It’s a really powerful analogy. There’s a lot of richness there politically." Our ruling Oliver claimed that 16 states prohibited interracial marriage in 1958. There were actually 24 states with legally enforceable statutes banning the marriage of blacks and whites then. Oliver’s number is off, but the precise figure only further supports her point about discrimination against interracial couples in the 1950s. We rate this statement Mostly True.

pomt-11118	Says "Rosie O’Donnell apparently committed the same offense five times, five times, when she broke the identical law that Dinesh (D'Souza) was prosecuted for."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jun/06/ted-cruz/dinesh-dsouza-and-rosie-odonnell-fec-violations-di/	Backlash to President Donald Trump’s pardon of Dinesh D’Souza caused complaints of a double standard among conservatives. In an interview with the Austin American-Statesman, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, told the reporter that D’Souza faced political persecution for a crime liberal comedian Rosie O’Donnell had committed five-fold. (Cruz also claimed credit for the pardon and called D’Souza his friend.) "What’s interesting is, just a few weeks ago we saw revelations that Rosie O’Donnell apparently committed the same offense five times, five times, when she broke the identical law that Dinesh was prosecuted for," Cruz said. "I don’t recall any of those liberal activists on Twitter calling for Rose O’Donnell to be prosecuted." Did O’Donnell commit the same offense as D’Souza? The two cases are very different. The Federal Election Commission caps donations to individual candidates at $2,700 per election. Primaries, runoffs and general elections are counted separately. On May 20, 2014, D’Souza was convicted of a felony for making illegal contributions to Wendy Long’s unsuccessful challenge of Kirsten Gillibrand to represent New York in the U.S. Senate. Long was a friend from D’Souza’s time at Dartmouth College. D’Souza was allowed to contribute a maximum of $5,000 to a single candidate. (The limit on each election was $2,500 in 2012 due to inflation, and this covered the primary and general election.) In March 2012, D’Souza gave $10,000 on behalf of himself and his wife. He then directed his assistant and a lover to also contribute $5,000 each on behalf of themselves and their spouses for a total of $20,000. D’Souza reimbursed them. D’Souza pleaded guilty "to violating the federal campaign election law by making illegal contributions to a United States Senate campaign in the names of others," the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York said in a statement. He "admitted that he knew that what he was doing was wrong and something the law forbids." D’Souza faced eight months in a supervised community confinement center, five years of probation, and a $30,000 fine. Trump pardoned D’Souza on May 31. The New York Post reported that O’Donnell made the following contributions, exceeding the individual limit of $2,700 by a total of $5,400. $4,700 to Alabama Sen. Doug Jones in the special general election against Roy Moore. $3,600 to Pennsylvania Rep. Conor Lamb for the special election he won in March. $2,950 to California Rep. Adam Schiff for his primary congressional race. $4,200 to Lauren Underwood, an Illinois congressional candidate, for her primary. (Note: when we searched the FEC individual contributor database, we found $2,700 are marked as going towards the primary campaign and $1,500 towards the general.) $3,450 to Omar Vaid, a congressional candidate in Staten Island and Brooklyn, for his primary. O’Donnell told the New York Post she did not deliberately exceed the limit. "If $2,700 is the cut off — (candidates) should refund the money," she said. "I don’t look to see who I can donate most to … I just donate assuming they do not accept what is over the limit." O’Donnell indeed broke FEC rules, but campaign finance experts told us this type of violation goes unpunished as long as there is no intent to deceive. The money can be refunded or redirected to the candidate’s next race. "The rather small amounts in excess of the limits, as well as the fact that O’Donnell made no effort to conceal the contributions, indicates this is just a sloppy mistake," said Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist at the left-leaning watchdog group Public Citizen. "Rosie O'Donnell contributed her own money in her own name to the candidates in question," said Michael Malbin, executive director at the Campaign Finance Institute. "The candidates are in fact responsible for keeping records and returning the extra, although she should also know what she is doing, as most donors do. Her contributions were fully disclosed." In an op-ed calling out a double standard, D’Souza said he did not buy O’Donnell’s defense. "I find this defense implausible because O’Donnell used four different – though similar –variations of her name and five different addresses," D’Souza wrote. The variations in her name were as follows: Rose Odonnell, Rose O’Donnell, Rosie O’Donnell, and Rosie Odonnell. She listed two different zip codes (which correspond with homes she owns) in two of the donations that exceeded the limit. Experts said D’Souza’s case was distinct by legal standards. D’Souza violated statutes 52 U.S.C. 30116 for exceeding contribution limits, 52 U.S.C. 30122 for making contributions in the name of another, and 18 U.S.C. 1001 for lying to law enforcement. The last (and most serious) charge was eventually dropped in the plea bargain. O’Donnell violated only the first statute. But criminal enforcement is only deemed appropriate if the violation is knowing and willful. Violators are usually subject to a civil penalty instead. The FEC has not announced an investigation of O’Donnell, although Holman said they "likely deemed that violation as unintentional and just not worth their time." Our ruling Cruz said, "Rosie O’Donnell apparently committed the same offense five times, five times, when she broke the identical law that Dinesh was prosecuted for." Both D’Souza and O’Donnell violated campaign contribution limits, which is a criminal offense. Those cases are subject to prosecution if determined to be willful. D’Souza’s violation was considered willful. He violated another law by using straw donors to donate $20,000 over the legal limit to one Senate candidate. O’Donnell surpassed the limit by a quarter of that money in donating to five different campaigns under her own name. We rate this statement False.

pomt-10141	"1.3-million people in America make their living off eBay."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/07/john-mccain/ebays-big-but-not-that-big/	Asked during the second presidential debate whom he would consider for treasury secretary, Sen. John McCain floated the name of former eBay chief executive Meg Whitman, then talked her up with an astounding statistic. "I like Meg Whitman," McCain said during the Oct. 7, 2008, debate. "She knows what it's like to be out there in the marketplace. She knows how to create jobs. Meg Whitman was the CEO of a company that started with 12 people and is now — 1.3-million people in America make their living off eBay." That's way off. We hate to nitpick apparent misstatements, but this one's a doozy — 1.3-million is the number of people worldwide who make some money off eBay, according to a 2006 A.C. Nielsen study. As of 2003, some 20,000 Americans made their living off eBay, company executive Jim Griffith told a Colorado newspaper at the time. These days, the company only keeps track of eBay entrepreneurs worldwide, and doesn't distinguish between full time and part time online auctioneers, a representative told us. But it's not conceivable that the number of Americans making a living off eBay has climbed to 1.3-million. In 2005, the latest year for which statistics are available, just 724,000 Americans made money selling on eBay, according to a Nielsen study. But that includes many who made just a few bucks – not a living. We examined this issue before , when McCain said 50,000 Americans made their living off eBay. The company told us it didn't know where he got that number, but we gave him a Half True because we couldn't be certain he was wrong. This time, his number is more than a million higher, and not even conceivably true. McCain bought himself a False.

pomt-13036	CNN accidentally aired 30 minutes of pornography in Boston on Thanksgiving night.	false	/punditfact/statements/2016/nov/29/blog-posting/reports-cnn-showed-pornography-instead-anthony-bou/	Following this year’s Thanksgiving dinner, a lone Twitter profile alleged that CNN was serving up something difficult to stomach — a half-hour of hardcore pornography. Apparently starved for content, the media ate it up. Around 10:30 p.m. ET on Nov. 24, 2016, Twitter user @solikearose tweeted from Boston that the scheduled episode of Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown was not appearing on CNN. She said there was an explicit sex scene showing on the network, instead. The user shared several images with TiVo digital programming information included, tagging from Boston-area cable provider RCN. (Image via Mediaite) Twitter being Twitter, rumors of explicit sex on a cable news channel spread quickly. Other users included the hashtag "#BourdainPorn" while sharing the images and discussing the alleged incident. By 9:54 a.m. ET the next day, cable provider RCN responded to the tweets. They said there had been no similar reports of pornography shown on CNN. At some point, major media outlets picked up on the subject and started posting stories based on @solikearose’s tweets. It’s not exactly clear what media outlet first wrote up a story, because so many have since edited their postings. (The Verge contends it was the U.K.’s Independent, which was then sent out by The Drudge Report with a tweet that read, "CNN accidentally airs 30 minutes of trans porn…") See Figure 5 on PolitiFact.com Other outlets that wrote posts about the supposed network nookie included the Daily Mail, Fox News, The Wrap, Esquire, Maxim, the New York Post, the New York Daily News and more, on down to smaller sites like Sputnik News and RT.com. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com The porn star in the photos, whom Twitter users identified as Riley Quinn, acknowledged the alleged exposure on Twitter. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Variety even quoted a CNN representative as saying the event indeed happened. "The RCN cable operator in Boston aired inappropriate content for 30 minutes on CNN last night. CNN has asked for an explanation." But while the story was shared far and wide in less than a day, it appeared by Friday evening that no one else had witnessed the same thing @solikearose had. On Friday evening, BuzzFeed News posted an interview with the purported original Twitter user, whom they only identified as a Boston woman named Rose. "I initially posted because I wanted to see if anyone else in Boston had been affected," she said. "I think it was a broadcasting error that affected only my house." The person BuzzFeed News interviewed assured the site that the incident was real, and that she had conversed with a customer service representative who advised her to restart her digital cable converter. The pornography then stopped, she said. She said had made her Twitter account private because she had been harassed online. BuzzFeed News quoted RCN Boston general manager Jeff Carlson as saying there had been no other complaints about the event. The account @solikearose has since been deleted, and most of the posts on the incident have since been updated, many of them calling the incident a "hoax." When we contacted CNN, the network gave us the same response it gave other outlets on Nov. 25: "Despite media reports to the contrary, RCN assures us that there was no interruption of CNN’s programming in the Boston area last night." CNN also noted to us that while many media outlets referred to the network airing the footage, the CNN feed is the same nationwide. That means every market gets the same programming, and any difference would be through the local cable provider. Shortly after the BuzzFeed News interview was posted, RCN wrote on their Facebook page about the flap. When we contacted RCN, they referred us to the same statement, attributing it to Carlson. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Bloggers said CNN accidentally aired 30 minutes of pornography in Boston on Thanksgiving night. Every account of this incident, which undoubtedly would have given thousands of viewers indigestion, relies on tweets from a single Twitter user. Media accounts appear to have spread based on the same information, despite no other reported complaints to the cable provider. The single customer’s cable equipment may have malfunctioned somehow, the provider said, but the person’s account is working properly. Media outlets that repeated the story have since backtracked on their single-source posts.

pomt-11057	"NASA announced that it communicated with four races of aliens."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/jun/25/blog-posting/no-nasa-has-not-communicated-aliens/	Social media users were puzzled when an online blog resurfaced a years-old claim saying NASA has communicated with four separate alien races. This ridiculous claim can be traced back to satire from 2016. "NASA announced that it communicated with four races of aliens," said a June 23, 2018, headline from The Life Buzz, an online blog. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) According to the false report, a NASA spokeswoman named Trish Chamberson said during a press conference that the space agency had known about alien life for years. "During the two hour briefing, NASA scientists confirmed previously speculated information about UFOs and Alien technology, confirming that four separate races of aliens are in regular contact with NASA, and have actually asked the agency to say hello to everyone on the planet for them," the false report said. This bogus story actually originated as satire on Waterford Whispers News, an Irish site that identifies as "a satirical newspaper and website" and "uses invented names in all its stories," according to its disclaimer page. The original article was published Aug. 26, 2016, and is clearly made-up. NASA does not list anyone named Trish Chamberson on its website. In fact, Snopes issued a fact-check in 2016 of websites attempting to republish the Waterford Whispers News article as a real news story. Several similar stories appeared without a disclaimer on blog sites and social media postings during 2016 and 2017. The Life Buzz post included no warning to readers that the story originally was published as satire. We rate this statement Pants on Fire!

pomt-15251	"97 percent of the work that Planned Parenthood does is about mammograms and preventative health."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/03/martin-omalley/97-planned-parenthoods-work-mammograms-preventive-/	The vast majority of Planned Parenthood’s work goes toward mammograms and preventive care, said former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley. Since an anti-abortion group released videos Planned Parenthood officials talking about aborted fetal parts, Republicans have pushed to take away federal funding from the women’s health organization. Democratic presidential candidates, on the other hand, are showing their support, if subdued. O’Malley said he hadn’t seen the videos, speaking to reporters in New Hampshire July 26. "And I don't generally make a habit of responding to right-wing videos," O'Malley said, according to Washington Post’s Dave Weigel. "I do know that 97 percent of the work that Planned Parenthood does is about mammograms and preventative health. So that's what I know, but I'll defer to others for commenting on that video and whatever videos they're pumping out there." Is 97 percent of what Planned Parenthood does mammograms and other preventive care, as opposed to abortions? O’Malley spokeswoman Haley Morris pointed us to a Planned Parenthood press release that had a similar, but not identical, statistic. "More than 97 percent of Planned Parenthood's services are primary and preventive health care, including lifesaving cancer screenings, birth control, testing and treatment of STDs, annual exams and health counseling," the 2011 release said. As we’ve found in previous fact-checks, Planned Parenthood comes to this number by adding up the number of individual services provided each year. In total, they provided nearly 11 million services in 2013, according to their most recent annual report. (Planned Parenthood clinics saw 2.7 million individual patients in 2013, so many received multiple services.) Here’s the breakdown from the annual report: Abortions: 327,653 Sexually transmitted infection/disease testing and treatment: 4,470,597 Contraception: 3,577,348 Cancer screening and prevention: 935,573 Pregnancy tests: 1,128,783 Prenatal services: 18,684 Family practice services: 65,464 Adoption referrals: 1,880 Urinary tract infection treatments: 47,264 Other: 17,187 Based on this list, it’s accurate that abortion procedures only count for 3 percent of all services provided, meaning 97 percent of the services Planned Parenthood provides are other forms of reproductive and primary care. By far, contraception and STI/STD testing and treatment are the most frequented services. Of their services, Planned Parenthood considers many to be preventive care in that they manage health and prevent disease or worse problems down the line. This includes STI/STD testing and treatment, contraception and cancer screening and prevention -- 8,983,518 services provided in 2013. Not included in this list are abortions, pregnancy tests, prenatal services, adoption referrals, UTI treatments, family practice services (a vague category that could include certain preventive care), and other services -- 1,606,915 services in 2013. Based on this breakdown, about 85 percent of Planned Parenthood’s work is preventive. Planned Parenthood spokeswoman Elizabeth Clark put the figure at 90 percent. But both are a bit lower than what O’Malley said: that 97 percent is preventive care and mammograms. Oh yeah, what about mammograms? Within the category of "cancer screening and prevention services," Planned Parenthood said it offered 487,029 breast exams or breast care services in 2013. However, as we’ve noted before, Planned Parenthood clinics do not provide mammograms themselves. Rather, Planned Parenthood physicians perform other types of breast exams and refer patients to outside clinics where they can get a mammogram. An October 2012 statement posted on Planned Parenthood’s website explained the group’s approach, which they said is helping women access mammograms via referral even though the clinics do not perform them in-house. So O’Malley’s 97 percent figure has some basis -- that’s the percentage of Planned Parenthood’s services that aren’t abortion. But that’s a broader category than "mammograms and preventative health," which O’Malley said. Our ruling O’Malley said, "97 percent of the work that Planned Parenthood does is about mammograms and preventative health." According to Planned Parenthood, about 97 percent of the services the group provides in a given year are services other than abortion. That includes preventive and primary care. Preventive care accounts for about 85 to 90 percent of the services Planned Parenthood provides. While mammograms are considered a form of preventive care, Planned Parenthood doesn’t do their own mammograms. Clinics perform breast exams and refer patients to outside clinics for an actual mammogram. The claim wasn’t pulled out of thin air, but it’s missing some important information, so we rate O’Malley’s claim Half True.

pomt-01162	Terrorist detainees "were not covered by the Geneva Convention. They were unlawful combatants. And under those circumstances, they were not entitled to the normal kinds of courtesies and treatment."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/dec/14/dick-cheney/wake-senate-report-dick-cheney-says-terrorists-not/	Former Vice President Dick Cheney has had a relatively quiet couple of years since leaving the White House. But with the recent release of a Senate report on alleged torture by the CIA, it was inevitable that Cheney -- who is closely associated with the post-9/11 policy of "enhanced interrogations" for captured terrorists -- would return to television screens. On Dec. 9, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence released a report about the CIA’s interrogation techniques in the wake of 9/11. About 500 pages of the 6,700-page report were made public. The report concluded that the techniques were not an effective way to gain intelligence from detainees, and that the CIA misled Congress and the White House. The report detailed such techniques as "rectal rehydration" and the use of coffin-size confinement boxes. A few days before a scheduled appearance on NBC’s Meet the Press, Cheney sat for an interview with Fox News’ Bret Baier. Here’s a portion of their exchange on Dec. 10, focusing on the fate of the detainees discussed in the Senate report. Baier: "Is there anything to the Geneva Convention, to the world rule of law on this?" Cheney: "Sure there is. But remember, the terrorists were not covered by the Geneva Convention. They were unlawful combatants. And under those circumstances, they were not entitled to the normal kinds of courtesies and treatment you would accord to those." There’s significant disagreement between Cheney and his critics on the issue of torture or "enhanced interrogation techniques." Still, experts told us that the question of what protections, if any, the detainees qualified for under the Geneva Convention -- is somewhat more clear-cut than other aspects of this policy debate. So we’ll take a closer look at Cheney’s claim that terrorist detainees "were not covered by the Geneva Convention. They were unlawful combatants. And under those circumstances, they were not entitled to the normal kinds of courtesies and treatment." The Geneva Conventions First, some background on the Geneva Conventions. They are a group of four international treaties covering different aspects of how civilians, prisoners of war and soldiers are to be treated once they are rendered incapable of fighting. (Read more about them here.) The most recent version of the treaties in force date from 1949; the United States has ratified all four though it has not ratified some of the protocols added later. The conventions guarantee a certain level of protection for former combatants, including prisoners of war and civilians. They set out in detail the requirements for food, clothing, shelter, safety from combat, access to medical care, and other matters. However, whether fighters could qualify for these protections depended on whether they adhered to some basic rules of law such as wearing uniforms, carrying arms openly, answering to a chain of command, and not committing war crimes. Many of those who would one day end up in Guantanamo Bay and other sites were from non-state terrorist groups and did not adhere to these rules. So these fighters were not guaranteed the same protections afforded POWs. Cheney’s strongest point in his interview with Baier was to draw this distinction between prisoners of war, who receive these extensive protections, and "unlawful combatants," who do not. There is, in fact, a distinction in the level of protection. What undercuts the accuracy of Cheney’s claim, however, is a different part of what he said. It’s misleading for him to say that such combatants are "not covered by the Geneva Convention." While detainees who do not have POW status don’t get the top level of protection, they do get more basic protections from the Geneva Conventions. And glossing over those less-stringent protections hides an important point: Even the lower level of protection would have shielded detainees, at least on paper, against some of the harsh treatments now alleged in the Senate report. Experts pointed us to identical passages in each of the four conventions, known as "Common Article 3." Among other things"prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever" by Common Article 3 are "violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture" as well as "outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment." In other words, despite the implications from what Cheney said, even unlawful combatants "have minimum protections under the Geneva Conventions," Richard D. Rosen, director of the Center for Military Law & Policy at Texas Tech University Law School. The Hamdan decision In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, there was considerable debate inside and outside the Bush administration about how captured members of al-Qaida and the Taliban should be treated. The Bush administration contended that the Geneva Conventions did not apply to terrorism suspects held abroad, siding with White House and Pentagon lawyers over objections from the State Department. Administration lawyers also approved the "enhanced interrogation techniques" and said they were legally permissible. The debate about the Geneva Convention piece of the equation ended in June 2006, when the U.S. Supreme Court issued its ruling in Hamdan vs. Rumsfeld, a watershed case on detainee rights. The 5-3 majority wrote that Common Article 3 "affords some minimal protection, falling short of full protection under the Conventions, to individuals associated with neither a signatory nor even a nonsignatory who are involved in a conflict 'in the territory of' a signatory." In other words, by this decision, "our own Supreme Court has made it completely clear that, whatever their status, (detainees) are entitled to some minimal protections under the Geneva Convention," said Steven R. Ratner, a University of Michigan law professor. "That ruling is binding law in the United States, no matter what the former vice president says." University of Notre Dame law professor Mary Ellen O’Connell, a specialist on international law, agreed. "The Supreme Court's ruling in Hamdan conflicts directly with the vice president’s assertion," she said. We will also note that while Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions is one source of basic protection for detainees, their rights to these protections may be bolstered by other international agreements as well. One is Article 75 of Additional Protocol I of the Geneva Conventions, which includes minimal protections for all people, whatever their status, who are caught in a conflict. While the U.S. has not ratified this protocol, the U.S. government has said that, "out of a sense of legal obligation" it will adhere to Article 75 for "any individual it detains in an international armed conflict, and expects all other nations to adhere to these principles as well." And despite resistance during the Bush administration, two other international agreements to which the United States is a party -- the 1984 Torture Convention and the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights -- would also prohibit torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, experts said. Our ruling Cheney said that terrorist detainees "were not covered by the Geneva Convention. They were unlawful combatants. And under those circumstances, they were not entitled to the normal kinds of courtesies and treatment." Cheney has a point that unlawful combatants are not afforded as high a level of protection as prisoners of war or civilians. However, his comment glosses over the fact that unlawful combatants are still accorded a minimum degree of protection, including a ban on "violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture," and "outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment," both of which have been validated by the Supreme Court. This is an important omission, since some of these very actions have been alleged in the Senate report. Because the statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-00581	"If you care about the environment, we've got record funding."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2015/jun/08/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-we-have-record-funding-environment/	Gov. Rick Scott says that Florida has invested big bucks in the environment. As he boasted about the state’s record during his economic summit for GOP presidential contenders in Orlando June 2, Scott reeled off a bunch of statistics about Florida’s budget and economy including this one: "If you care about the environment, we've got record funding." Scott’s record on the environment has been scrutinized since he first ran for office in 2010. Since that time, news reports detailed how state officials under his watch have been banned from using terms such as "climate change," environmental fines have nosedived, and Scott has boasted about reducing the number of days to get an environmental permit. But despite that record, does Florida now have "record funding" for the environment? No, it doesn’t. Everglades and springs funding Scott’s spokesman pointed us to his proposals to increase funding for springs restoration and for preserving the Everglades. During his re-election campaign in 2014, Scott promised to propose a $500 million plan over 10 years to restore springs. The 2013 budget included $10 million for springs, and the 2014 the budget included $30 million. In his budget proposal for 2015-16, Scott recommended $50 million. As for the Everglades, the state reached an agreement in 2012 with the federal government to end a dispute that predates Scott. Over 13 years, the state will spend $880 million on Everglades cleanup, or about $32 million a year. In 2014 the Legislature increased Everglades restoration funding to $169 million, more than double the previous year’s total. The Legislature also earmarked $90 million for raising 2.6 miles of the Tamiami Trail to let the Everglades flow more freely beneath it. That brought the total amount during that session to $259 million. "The one place where he did step up was on the Everglades," said Frank Jackalone, Sierra Club’s Senior Organizing Manager in Florida. "It was the environmental highlight of his term as governor." But where Scott has fallen short on the Everglades is acquiring U.S. Sugar land south of Lake Okeechobee, Jackalone said. A deal in the works for the state to buy about 46,000 acres fell apart earlier this year. Department of Environmental Protection While Everglades and springs restoration are important parts of environmental funding, they don’t provide a complete picture. If we look back a decade at funding for the Department of Environmental Protection, the high point was $2.9 billion in 2006-07 under then Gov. Jeb Bush. DEP is tasked with protecting air, water and land. Under Scott, DEP’s budget peaked at $1.8 billion in 2011-12. In 2006-07, the state used an extra $310 million (on top of Florida Forever’s usual $300 million land-buying program) to purchase Babcock Ranch, 73,000 acres of cypress domes and pine forests in Charlotte and Lee counties. DEP’s budget was also in the $2 billion range part of the time under the next governor, Charlie Crist. But once the recession kicked in, DEP’s budget decreased. This year, the total budget is $1.56 billion, and for next year Scott proposed a budget of about $1.53 billion -- $29 million less than the current year. (You can see the year-by-year DEP funding and caveats including that it combines state and federal dollars.) What Scott omits There have been several other cuts related to the environment under Scott: In 2011, Scott and the Legislature abolished the Department of Community Affairs, which for decades reviewed development plans in cities and counties; The same year, Scott and lawmakers forced state water management districts to slash property tax collections. Water management districts handle planning for water resources and wetlands protection, among other environmental issues; Revenue collected from environmental penalties plummeted from $9.3 million in Scott’s first year to $1.4 million in 2013; Funding for Florida Forever, the state’s land acquisition program, was about $100 million when he took office. It has stayed below $28 million since. That led to environmentalists advocating for Amendment 1, which was approved by 75 percent of voters in November. Scott took no position on the amendment before it passed, and his spokeswoman did not mention it as part of his evidence for this fact-check. Amendment sponsors had hoped that the land buying program would get $300 million to return it to pre-recession levels, but Scott’s budget proposal this year included $100 million for Florida Forever, while legislators proposed less. "Record funding" for the environment has become a talking point for Scott. But after we rated a similar claim False in 2014, he tweaked his message to talk specifically about "record funding" for springs. On the national stage surrounded by presidential contenders in May, he went back to talking about record funding generically for the environment. But environmentalists say he doesn’t hold a record for overall environmental funding. "He cut back services to DEP, he cut back funding to various water management districts in state, he hasn’t done what needs to be done to acquire sugar land south of Okeechobee to finish Everglades restoration," Jackalone said. Also, "he cut back on environmental enforcement." Our ruling Scott said, "If you care about the environment, we've got record funding." Scott's team points to investments the state has made to restore the Everglades and springs during Scott’s tenure -- and he has championed both. While those are high-profile projects, he claimed that Florida has "record funding" for the environment overall, and that’s not the case. The budget for the state Department of Environmental Protection and for Florida Forever were not a record under Scott -- two major pots of money that relate to the environment. Scott repeated a previously debunked claim in a national forum; his statement has long been proved incorrect.

pomt-08269	"Animal abuse is often an indicative trait of future acts of violence against humans."	true	/georgia/statements/2010/nov/10/robert-brown/state-senator-says-animal-cruelty-lead-violent-adu/	State Sen. Robert Brown wants to strengthen Georgia's animal cruelty laws and made his case at a recent hearing. "Animal abuse is often an indicative trait of future acts of violence against humans," said Brown, a Democrat from Macon, "and prosecuting such behavior is our first line of defense against potentially dangerous criminals." Is it true? Are people who abuse animals more likely to hurt people? "He's right," said Mary Lou Randour, professional outreach director for animal cruelty for the Humane Society of the United States. "It's just another example of the type of people who are anti-social and aggressive." Animal cruelty became a hot topic in these parts in 2007 when one of the state's biggest athletic stars, Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick, was accused of participating in a dogfighting ring with some of his longtime friends. Vick pleaded guilty, served time in prison and is now the starting QB for the Philadelphia Eagles. Randour sent us links to several academic studies that link animal abuse to violence against people. We looked at those. And we looked at a variety of other information relating to the subject. Researchers have been conducting more detailed studies on the subject for several decades. The findings are similar: - The Chicago Police Department looked at 332 animal cruelty and related cases from July 2001 to July 2004. Police found 70 percent of suspects had prior arrests for other felonies. Eighty-six percent of them had two or more prior arrests. - A 2007 study of some women in domestic violence shelters found their abusers were 11 times more likely to have harmed or killed a pet. - A 1983 study of alleged child abuse found evidence in 60 percent of the cases of possible earlier animal abuse. - Of 117 men serving time in South African prisons for crimes "of aggression," nearly two-thirds of them admitted to cruelty to animals, according to a 1999 study. Brown authored legislation in 2000 that allows animal abuse to be charged as a felony. The senator said he pushed for the changes, in part, from anecdotal stories of people who abused animals when they were young and committed felonies against people as adults. Brown also was swayed by FBI agents who made the connection between animal abuse and violence against people. Brown said he's considering legislation that would create tougher penalties on people who abuse animals in the presence of children. Brown said he's not sure whether it will pass when the Legislature convenes in January because he understands lawmakers will be focused on the state's budget challenges and there will be a large freshman class at the Gold Dome next year. "We want to look at a remedy [to the existing law] that will have some broad impact," he said. Brown appears to have done his homework on his claim about the connection between animal abuse and violence against humans. There is overwhelming research that Brown is right. This one is a slam-dunk. We rate his claim as True.	None	Robert Brown	None	None	None	2010-11-10T06:00:00	2010-10-29	['None']
pomt-03125	Warren Buffett recently said "Scrap Obamacare and Start All Over."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/17/blog-posting/bloggers-say-warren-buffett-recently-turned-agains/	Conservative Internet bloggers are turning up three-year-old quotes from Warren Buffett and casting them as fresh evidence that American support is dwindling for President Barack Obama's health care law. But the quotes are not properly identified as three years old and do not reflect Buffett's full thinking on the health care law. It's unclear why or how the old quotes resurfaced. But we started seeing the Buffett quotes in Facebook feeds on the morning of Sept. 17, 2013, after the Weekly Standard linked to it, starting its blog post, "You know things are bad for President Obama when even Warren Buffett has soured on Obamacare and says that 'we need something else.' " The link went to a website called Money Morning, which posted an entry on Sept. 13 titled, "Buffett: Scrap Obamacare and Start All Over." The post on the website includes quotes from Buffett, including: • "Health care costs in the United States are like a tapeworm eating at our economic body." • "We have a health system that, in terms of costs, is really out of control. And if you take this line and you project what has been happening into the future, we will get less and less competitive. So we need something else." • "Attack the costs first, and then worry about expanding coverage. I would much rather see another plan that really attacks costs. And I think that's what the American public wants to see. I mean, the American public is not behind this bill." The post goes on to paraphrase Buffett as saying he would scrap Obamacare and start over. A variety of other conservative media outlets spotlighted the post in the past week as a development in the ongoing battle over the health care law, such as Wall Street Journal blogger James Taranto and Newsbusters. But the comments come from an interview that Buffett, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., gave to CNBC on March 1, 2010 -- three and a half years ago, before the bill was signed. Buffett's office told PolitiFact that the blog reports do not reflect his views. Buffett "has never said or thought that Obamacare should be scrapped," said Debbie Bosanek, Buffett's assistant. She said she showed him our research and that he said our analysis "covered it very well." So what did Buffett say in 2010? They can be found in a Politico article published at the time that summarized the interview. That article also includes other tidbits excluded from the more recent blog posts that paint a more nuanced picture of his views. • Buffett was referring to a bill that was still pending in Congress. At the time of his comments, a bill had passed the Senate, but lawmakers were still deciding how to get it through the House, so he’d have reason to think his comments might carry some weight in bargaining over details. He was not referring to the law after it was on the books, and he did not make his comments with three and a half years of hindsight from looking at its implementation. • Buffett said the bill he was criticizing was still worth passing despite its imperfections. According to Politico, Buffett was asked on CNBC whether he would be in favor of scrapping the Senate’s version of the health care bill; he responded: "I would be." However, Politico also noted "that while he does not like the Senate bill, he’d vote for it in preference to doing nothing." Buffett said in the interview, "If it was a choice today between plan A, which is what we've got, or plan B, … the Senate bill, I would vote for the Senate bill. But I would much rather see a plan C that really attacks costs." It’s worth noting that in July 2012, just after the Supreme Court upheld the health care law, Buffett told Bloomberg TV that the court made the right decision. Invoking the same metaphor, Buffett said health care is "the tapeworm, essentially, of the American economy, and we have not dealt with that yet." But he added, "Obamacare is a step in the right direction in many ways." Shortly after we started looking into the blog posts, the Weekly Standard added an "update" to its post. It said, "It appears that Buffett made his anti-Obamacare comments in 2010, thereby showing that he, like most of the American people, has opposed Obamacare since even before it was passed — a point that Mark Hemingway addressed yesterday in response to USA Today’s implication that Americans’ widespread dislike of Obamacare is mostly attributable to Republicans’ efforts to fight it." We sent inquiries to the Weekly Standard and Money Morning but did not hear back. We also sent an inquiry to Buffett and will publish a comment if he offers one. Our ruling A variety of blogs reprinted an item indicating that Warren Buffett recently said "Scrap Obamacare and Start All Over." However, the comments came from an interview in 2010, when the health care bill was still being debated, and are not based on the subsequent three and a half years of seeing the law implemented. If anything, comments by Buffett in 2012 suggest that he’s pleased to see the law being put into effect, despite the shortcomings he sees. The notion that Buffett had recently turned on a president he supported by souring on his signature health care law could have been easily debunked using Google searches.

pomt-08636	Harry Reid has voted "to give illegals Social Security benefits even for the time they were here illegally."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/17/sharron-angle/sharron-angle-says-harry-reid-wants-give-illegals-/	We’ve rated one claim in an ad by Nevada Republican Senate candidate Sharron Angle as False. That was a claim that Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid voted "go give special tax breaks to illegal aliens." The second charge in the ad is that Reid voted "to give illegals Social Security benefits even for the time they were here illegally." Until a change in the law in 2007, illegal immigrants had a right to receive credit in their benefits calculation for Social Security payments they had made while working illegally, typically while using an unauthorized Social Security number. They received such credit only after they had received legal working papers and a genuine Social Security number. As much as several billion dollars a year are typically collected from illegal immigrants by the Social Security system. Reid voted twice to uphold this system. During a Senate debate over immigration reform in 2006, Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev., offered an amendment to prevent anyone from earning credit for Social Security payments made using an unauthorized Social Security number -- a provision that would mostly if not entirely affect illegal aliens. On May 18, 2006, the Senate voted on a motion to table -- that is, to stop consideration of -- the Ensign amendment. By a bare one-vote majority, the chamber voted to table the amendment. Reid's was one of the 50 votes in favor of tabling. Then, on July 19, 2007, Ensign tried again, proposing a similar amendment to the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007. Under the rules in effect, the amendment needed 60 votes to pass but only got 57, so it failed. Reid was one of the senators who voted against the amendment. So the fact that Reid voted "no" twice provides support for Angle's claim. But it isn't foolproof. First, Reid also cast another vote on this issue that Angle's camp doesn't mention. On Oct. 23, 2007, during another immigration bill debate, Ensign offered a similar amendment. This time, the Senate passed it by an overwhelming 92-2 vote. Reid was one of 92 senators to support the amendment. But that's not all. We also see problems with the ad's explanation of what was being voted on. For one thing, the vote wouldn't have given current illegals Social Security benefits, as the ad implies. Instead, Reid's votes affected the policy for former illegal aliens who were later made legal. For another, the vote was not about giving benefits but rather on whether to change the calculation process so that former illegals could get credit for money they had paid into the system years before, when they were illegal. We consider these descriptions misleading, and in combination with the ad's decision to ignore Reid's contrary vote, we feel the this part of the statement deserves a rating of Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-05994	President Obama has "said he is going to cut veterans' benefits."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/20/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-obama-wants-cut-veterans-benefi/	Rick Santorum says the president wants to solve the budget deficit by picking the pockets of America’s military veterans. In a debate on Jan. 19, 2012, in Charleston, S.C., Santorum said he grew up in VA housing and saw Vietnam vets who were badly in need of medical and psychological care. He said service members returning from war now should have better support. "We need to be much, much more aggressive. We have the president of the United States who said he is going to cut veterans' benefits, cut our military, at a time when these folks are four, five, six, seven tours, coming back, in and out of jobs, sacrificing everything for this country," Santorum said. We decided to check: Does President Barack Obama intend to cut benefits for veterans? Expansions to benefits Obama’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2012 increases the overall Veterans Affairs budget by more than 10 percent. The numbers are big: from $53 billion in FY 2010 to almost $59 billion in FY 2012. It provides new benefits for veterans’ caregivers, including health care and mental health services, and invests nearly $1 billion in VA services for homeless veterans and those at risk of becoming homeless. The White House pointed us to several examples of how VA services have been beefed up, summed up in a comment Obama made in 2009: "We dramatically increased funding for veterans' health care: more care for women's veterans, for our wounded warriors from Iraq and Afghanistan suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injuries," Obama said at a 2009 signing of a bill that funds veterans’ medical care a year in advance. Separately, PolitiFact has given Obama seven Promise Kept ratings on pledges he made to improve services to veterans, compared with zero Promise Brokens. Proposed cuts Santorum’s campaign did not respond to our email about his statement, but he may have been referring to Obama's deficit reduction plan, which increases fees for some programs. In September 2011, Obama submitted his outline for how to pay for his American Jobs Act. It was intended to serve as a guide to the joint committee tasked with finding savings in the federal budget. In that plan, Obama proposed three possible "reforms" or increases in fees in military programs: * A new $200 annual fee for TRICARE for Life recipients. Open to veterans 65 and older, TRICARE for Life pays out-of-pocket expenses not covered by Medicare. This proposed fee is estimated to save approximately $6.7 billion over 10 years, according to the plan. * Increases in pharmacy co-pays. The plan says "co-payments for military members have lagged behind other federal and private plans. For example, the average co-payment for a costly brand-name drug purchased at a drug store by a federal retiree in the most popular medical plan option is estimated to be $45, compared to $9 for a military retiree." * Review and reform military retirement benefits. The current system, the plan states, "provides generous benefits to the relatively few members who stay for at least 20 years and no benefits for the roughly 80 percent of service members who stay less than 20 years. To consider reforms the Administration plans to set up a commission to develop recommendations for reforming the current military retirement system." We should add that the president suggests grandfathering in those now serving so that major reforms don’t affect them. What others say We contacted a few veterans groups to get their take on how the president has served veterans. Joe Davis, director of public affairs for Veterans of Foreign Wars, said Obama "has been consistent in statement and action on protecting the Department of Veterans Affairs budget." But the changes Obama has floated are a concern. "We are, however, concerned that budget cuts currently under consideration by the Department of Defense could undermine the viability of the all-volunteer force by changing the current military retirement system and by diverting more health care costs—higher enrollment fees and prescription co-payments—onto the backs of military retirees who were first required to donate 20 or more years of their youth to their nation. This is in addition to previously announced plans to shrink the size of the active-duty force," Davis said in an email. Joe Violante, national legislative director for Disabled American Veterans, echoed that sentiment. "The president has increased vet funding over the years and has expanded many programs, women vets, caregivers and PTSD and TBI (traumatic brain injury), to name a few. He is also responsible for supporting advance appropriations for VA health care funding. While you are correct in saying there are proposals to TRICARE fees, these are not usually considered vet programs and come under DOD. Thus far, vet programs have done well under this administration," Violante said in an email. Our ruling Santorum said that Obama has pledged to cut veterans’ benefits. That is not the case with the VA budget, which Obama wants to increase. But there are some proposals for programs in the Defense Department budget that might shift more expenses to veterans. On balance, we rate Santorum's claim Half True.	None	Rick Santorum	None	None	None	2012-01-20T18:21:40	2012-01-19	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-11771	"If you don't pay income taxes ... you'll have more money" under the Republican tax plan.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/29/tim-scott/if-you-pay-no-taxes-will-you-end-more-money-under-/	Will the Republican tax proposals be a boon for Americans who currently don’t earn enough to pay taxes? Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., says yes. Days before the Senate was slated to take up the tax bill, Scott was interviewed by Martha Raddatz on ABC’s This Week. Here’s a portion of their exchange about the Senate legislation: Raddatz: "About 45 percent of Americans don't pay income tax, and many of those are the working poor. So, how does it help them?" Scott: "Well, if you don't pay income taxes and we increase your refund by 40 percent, that is a direct dollar impact. In other words, you'll have more money to use to keep those ends together, those single mothers like mine, who are working paycheck to paycheck, they will now not get a $9,300 deduction." To streamline the wording, we decided to fact-check his overall point that a typical family not currently paying income taxes would receive more money under the overhaul. (His office did not object to that paraphrase.) These people would not be getting an increased "refund of 40 percent," or a "$9,300 deduction," even though Scott said that. Those changes would not improve the position of people who already do not pay income taxes. (Scott’s office said those points referred to an earlier discussion in the interview.) The 40 percent figure refers to early estimates by the Republican staff of the Senate Finance Committee about how Americans with specific income and family structures would gain from passage of the bill. (More recent projections are here.) As for the $9,300 deduction, that’s roughly the amount the Senate bill would increase the current standard deduction for single heads of households. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., interviewed on ABC's "This Week" Again, those don't apply here, even though they were in Scott's claim. So we wondered how it would be possible for Americans who already don't pay income taxes to see money from the proposed tax overhaul. The individual mandate If a household already was paying no taxes, having more money in their pocket would require either getting more money back from the government through the tax process, or arguing that the economic growth spurred by the tax bill would inevitably generate raises for the workers in that household. However, the GOP tax bills do not expand the earned income tax credit, which is a refundable credit designed to put more money in the pockets of the working poor. If anything, the bills' use of a slower-growing inflation measure called chained CPI would make EITC refunds less valuable over time. And another refundable tax credit, the child tax credit, would see tighter eligibility rules for the refundable portion, which could result in some households losing that portion of the credit. Meanwhile, even those who argue that the bill’s corporate and income tax cuts will spur economic growth can’t guarantee that any particular American will receive a raise. As it turns out, Scott’s office offered a different justification -- one involving the proposal in the Senate bill to rescind the individual mandate for purchasing health insurance. That provision of the Affordable Care Act requires that Americans who don’t have health insurance to pay a tax penalty. "By repealing the individual mandate, a tax paid overwhelmingly by the middle and working classes, the Senate bill removes a burden placed on low-income families," said Michele Exner, a spokeswoman for Scott. The individual mandate penalty does fall disproportionately on lower- and moderate-income households. And lower- and moderate-income households are also likeliest to owe no federal income taxes. Here’s how Scott’s example of a family saving money from the tax bill would work. Say you’re a family that did not earn enough to face a tax burden. Currently, you’d have a choice regarding health coverage -- either pay for insurance, at roughly $2,500 a year after subsidies for a typical Affordable Care Act plan, or forgo insurance and pay the penalty. This year, the penalty is either 2.5 percent of income, or $695 per adult and $347.50 per child, up to a family maximum of $2,085 —whichever is higher. If the individual mandate is rescinded, this family would have a different choice: Either keep paying for insurance, or drop their insurance and save whatever their individual-mandate penalty would have been. Here’s what could happen Does Scott’s justification hold water? This scenario could leave certain low-income households with more money in their pocket -- but there's no guarantee. One possibility is that a family would keep their insurance despite the removal of the individual mandate; in that case, they wouldn’t be assured of saving any money. Health care experts say that if too many young and healthy Americans go without insurance, the premiums for everyone else will go up. If that scenario plays out, this group might end up with less money in their pocket, contrary to Scott’s assertion. The alternative would be for this family to drop their insurance. This could lead to a gain in pocket money, depending on how much they spend on health care. That's because the family would now be on the hook for all of their medical expenses. If they were blessed with luck and stayed healthy, they would come out ahead compared to the status quo. But if they fell seriously ill, the costs could be ruinous. "Whether I will have more or less money in my pocket at the end of the year depends on whether or not I incur sufficiently higher medical expenses to wipe out the savings," said Daniel Shaviro, a New York University law professor who specializes in tax law. "Even insofar as the statement is literally true in some cases, it’s fundamentally dishonest and misleading." What an independent analysis shows So how would lower- to middle-income families fare overall under the Senate bill that includes the elimination of the individual mandate? The Joint Committee on Taxation -- Congress’ nonpartisan office for analyzing tax proposals -- has found that the provisions in the Senate bill, taken collectively, would increase tax collection from the lowest income ranges. In 2019, each of the three income ranges below $30,000 would see increases in tax revenue. (This refers to cumulative totals for all households within that income range; individual households may see their taxes go up or down, depending on their specific situation.) And by 2027, every income range below $75,000 would see a collective tax increase. Here’s the summary table. (This assumes no further action from Congress during that time.) See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Lower-income Americans could get another hit from the Republican tax proposal if budget cuts are needed to offset the loss of federal tax revenue for programs that help the poor, said Gary McGill, director of the Fisher School of Accounting at the University of Florida. All in all, McGill said he finds Scott's argument to be an odd one. "If I quit paying rent, I’ll have more money in my pocket, but I’ll be homeless," he said. "Or if I quit buying food, I’ll have more money -- until I’m dead." Our ruling Scott said, "If you don't pay income taxes ... you'll have more money" under the Republican tax plan. Scott’s logic rests on Americans who do not pay income taxes no longer having to pay the penalty for not carrying health insurance. However, people who decided to keep buying health insurance despite the lifting of the individual mandate penalty wouldn’t benefit under Scott’s scenario. And if they decided to forgo health insurance and pocket the amount of the individual mandate penalty instead, they would only end up ahead if they remained healthy enough to keep their medical costs low. That’s more of a gamble than anything close to a certainty. We rate this statement False.

pomt-07699	Says city of Portland has a one-time $22 million surplus	half-true	/oregon/statements/2011/mar/07/sam-adams/sam-adams-says-portlands-finances-show-one-time-22/	Despite these hard economic times, the city of Portland is doing just fine. It’s doing so well, in fact, that it’s running a budget surplus. At least, that’s what Mayor Sam Adams has been telling residents. The news seems to have first cropped up in Adams’ own blog on Dec. 8, 2010: "In last two years, because of our more conservative revenue forecasting, a federal accounting rule change & tamped-down spending (ex: no CPI raises for city staff) results in $21 million one-time surplus." In recent weeks, Adams has been using the line with some frequency. In a question-and-answer with Willamette Week published Feb. 16, 2011 he said, "You asked me what I was proud of. And we have a budget surplus. A one-time budget surplus. We’re in a very different position than most major cities in the United States and most of the governments around us." He repeated the claim in more detail during his State of the City address on Feb. 18, 2011. In fact, he repeated it twice: "Let me repeat. Next year we begin with a $22 million, one-time, general fund surplus." If that’s true, it’s a pretty good reason to be self-congratulatory. After all, like Adams said, most other budgets aren’t looking so good these days. Take, for example, the multibillion-dollar shortfall the state is facing going into the next two-year budget cycle. But, we wondered, is it true? Could Portland really be running a surplus when all we hear about are deficits? So, we decided to check out the mayor’s State of the City claim that Portland is starting next year with a $22 million one-time surplus. In order to see what the city’s finances look like, we turned to a 5-year budget forecast that was released in December. The document, on first glance, seemed to back Adams up. Resources for the upcoming budget should be somewhere in the neighborhood of $398 million while required expenditures are estimated at $376 million. Take the latter from the former and you get a budget surplus of $21.7 million. If you keep reading, though, the numbers get murky. For instance, Table 1 mentions an additional $10.5 million in "continued unfunded ongoing" expenditures. Basically, that category is made up of things that traditionally get funded but aren’t "required." You throw that into the equation and suddenly the city’s surplus is halved ($11.2 million to be precise). The confusion doesn’t end there. Continue on to Table 2, and the report offers a separate scenario. Again, we start with a $21.7 million surplus, but then, it says, there are two new categories to consider: "new one-time" expenses and "additional on-going spending." Those two bits add up to $15 million. Take that from the $21.7 million surplus and the city is left with $6.7 million. What’s more, the forecast goes on to say that the city really shouldn’t spend that $6.7 million. See, the city budgets with five-year forecasts. The idea is that the budget being crafted this year will pave the way for a zero-balance budget five years down the road. In order to get to that zero balance, the city needs to hold onto that $6.7 million, according to the report. So, the forecast concludes, the city’s surplus might not even exist. City of Portland economist Josh Harwood puts it this way: "We're not in crisis mode. We're not short-selling the house, but we're not buying a new car either." Until the details of the budget are hammered out, it’s difficult to tell what surplus -- if any -- will remain. According to the December analysis, that remaining balance could be as high as $21.7 million or as low as, well, nothing. We gave the mayor’s office a call to see if we’d missed something. "The number is accurate," Roy Kaufmann, the mayor’s spokesman said, referring to the $21.7 million figure. But "it does not take into account the one-time spending." "We're too early in the budget process to know ... how that all is going to shake out," Kaufmann added. "I think that the point that the mayor was making was demonstrating to city residents how Portland was being fiscally responsible and fairly fiscally conservative since he was elected, even before he was sworn in." That may be true, but if it’s too early in the budget process to know how the one-time funding is going to shake out, it seems to us that it’s also too early to be trumpeting a surplus at all -- let alone a pretty optimistic one of $22 million. We rate Adams’ claim that Portland has a one-time surplus of $22 million as Half True -- the statement is partially true, but it leaves out some pretty important details. Comment on this item.

pomt-04694	"Republicans would give seniors a (Medicare) voucher that limits what's covered, costing seniors as much as $6,400 more a year."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/05/kathleen-sebelius/kathleen-sebelius-repeats-problematic-claim-romney/	Democrats pushed to reclaim "Obamacare" at their national convention in Charlotte, N.C., deploying the secretary of Health and Human Services to celebrate it as a "badge of honor." But Kathleen Sebelius trotted out some problematic talking points in her Sept. 4, 2012, defense of the president’s health care law, saying, for example, that "Republicans would give seniors a voucher that limits what's covered, costing seniors as much as $6,400 more a year." We’ve rated similar claims from Democrats about that extra cost, rating them Half Trueand Mostly Falsebecause they rely on an analysis of an outdated Republican plan. We’ve also rated whether Republicans "want to turn Medicare into a voucher system," finding it Mostly True— their plan is somewhere between "premium support" and "vouchers." Sebelius combined the two claims for a less-than-true statement. Let us explain. The Romney-Ryan Medicare plan Republican vice presidential candidate Rep. Paul Ryan released his initial Medicare plan in early 2011. Under this plan, Medicare would have changed from a program that pays doctors and hospitals fees for particular services to one in which beneficiaries would be paid an amount by the government that they could use toward private insurance premiums. This would have affected people who today are under 55 only, but critics said those who fell under the new rules would face an increasingly large gap between what the government paid for their benefits and what their health care services cost. It would limit "what’s covered," as Sebelius put it, in that seniors would get a defined contribution to buy coverage rather than the defined benefits of traditional Medicare. The plan was approved by the GOP-controlled House before dying in the Senate, where Democrats called it radical and harmful to beneficiaries. Subsequently, Ryan offered updated versions of the plan, the first in conjunction with Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and then as part of his fiscal year 2013 budget proposal. It still offers seniors a defined amount toward private insurance rather than paying providers directly. That’s why we’ve said it’s Mostly Trueto call it a voucher system. But the new plan has two key differences from Ryan’s previous proposal. The newer version allows beneficiaries under 55 a choice — they can use their payment to buy private insurance or a plan that acts like traditional Medicare. Meanwhile, the size of the payment would be set by the market — the price of the second-cheapest plan. The most recent Ryan plan appears to be the closest to the Romney-Ryan campaign’s position. In an interviewwith a Green Bay, Wis., television station on Aug. 15, Romney said, "Paul Ryan and my plan for Medicare, I think, is the same, if not identical — it's probably close to identical." That makes Sebelius’ claim about cost an outdated one. Here’s how. The $6,400 question Previous claims by Democrats of a $6,400 increase in out-of-pocket costs cite a reportby the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. Here’s what the group said: "In 2022, the first year the voucher would apply, (the Congressional Budget Office) estimates that total health care expenditures for a typical 65-year-old would be almost 40 percent higher with private coverage under the Ryan plan than they would be with a continuation of traditional Medicare," center president Bob Greenstein wrote. "CBO also finds that this beneficiary's annual out-of-pocket costs would more than double — from $6,150 to $12,500. In later years, as the value of the voucher eroded, the increase in out-of-pocket costs would be even greater. The difference between $12,500 (the out-of-pocket costs under the Ryan plan in 2022) and $6,150 (the out-of-pocket costs that year under traditional Medicare) is $6,350, which is very close to $6,400. But here’s the problem: The CBO analysis, and other groups’ analyses built on those CBO numbers, refer to the original Ryan plan, not to the current one. The current plan, while it caps overall growth in Medicare spending, is slightly more generous in how fast it allows subsidies to grow as health care costs increase. Ryan also made a number of other technical changes to address concerns that the credits wouldn’t keep up if medical costs kept going up and up. As we mentioned before, the amount a beneficiary receives, for example, would be based on the second least-expensive plan available on a Medicare exchange. The earlier out-of-pocket estimate was based on the idea that seniors’ initial payments would be tied to how much the government had previously paid for their Medicare coverage, forcing seniors to pony up the difference for more expensive private plans. Traditional Medicare would not have been among their options. In the new proposal, Medicare is one of the options, and the payment’s size is based on the price of one of the available plans. So if Medicare were a cheaper option, seniors could use their premium support payment toward purchasing it and save money. If traditional Medicare were more expensive than the second-least expensive plan, it could cost seniors more out-of-pocket to keep it. An estimate of that expense, though, would differ from analysis for Ryan’s earlier plan. But Ryan hasn’t yet asked for a rigorous analysis of his new proposal. "CBO has not analyzed the policies that might be implemented to produce such a path for Medicare spending, including a premium-support approach to Medicare of the sort that Chairman Ryan and other Members of Congress have recently discussed," CBO wrote earlier this year. There is one clue that under the proposal, extra costs for seniors who wanted to keep traditional Medicare wouldn’t come close to $6,400. A study published Aug. 1, 2012, in the Journal of the American Medical Association says that if Ryan’s plan had been in place in 2009, the cost of the second-cheapest Medicare Advantage plan (and thus the size of the premium support payment) would have been 9 percent less than traditional Medicare. That would have required an out-of-pocket payment for seniors who wanted to use traditional Medicare of $64 a month — which adds up to less than $800 a year. Meanwhile, under the Ryan plan, seniors could also choose to buy the plan covered entirely by the premium support payment — for no extra out-of-pocket cost. And all plans offered under the proposal would have to provide at least the actuarial equivalent of traditional Medicare. Of course, absent details from the Ryan camp and an updated CBO analysis, it’s still not clear what would happen over time if the new, market-based payments grew faster than the Ryan plan’s cap on Medicare spending. Would savings still come from beneficiaries? Or providers? Or somewhere else? The absence of details and rigorous analysis of the new plan means that claims about its financial impact on seniors are speculative. It’s irresponsible of Sebelius to repeat a number about an old Republican plan just because she doesn’t have an updated analysis of the new — and different — plan. Meanwhile, to say the new plan provides a voucher "that limits what's covered," as Sebelius said, oversimplifies how it might work. Traditional Medicare limits coverage to specific areas such as doctor and hospital visits, which is why some seniors buy private "gap" insurance to add benefits such as vision, hearing and dental. Under the new Ryan plan, the voucher amount to buy a private policy or traditional Medicare would be limited to the cost of the second-least-expensive policy that provided at least the actuarial equivalent — or same value — of benefits under traditional Medicare. But what got covered might vary from policy to policy. Our ruling Sebelius recycled an old number about an outdated Republican plan when she said, "Republicans would give seniors a voucher that limits what's covered, costing seniors as much as $6,400 more a year." She’s right that a shift to paying a defined amount for seniors to buy their own insurance essentially offers them a voucher. But the Republicans’ Medicare exchange with market-based premium support payments would offer more protection than a pure voucher. And we simply don’t have enough details about that new plan to know how much extra money seniors might have to pay for traditional Medicare. We rate her full statement Half True.

pomt-12347	Rare is the president "who's passed more legislation, who's done more things than what we've done, between the executive orders and the job-killing regulations that have been terminated."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jun/13/donald-trump/donald-trumps-boasts-about-accomplishments-office-/	Some commentators called it "the weirdest Cabinet meeting ever": President Donald Trump’s leadership team gathered to deliver a litany of praise for the president. Trump saved some of the boasting for himself, making claims that his administration has been one of historic accomplishments. "I will say that never has there been a president -- with few exceptions; in the case of FDR, he had a major depression to handle -- who's passed more legislation, who's done more things than what we've done, between the executive orders and the job-killing regulations that have been terminated," Trump said, later adding, "We've achieved tremendous success." We’ve previously checked Trump’s claim in April that "no administration has accomplished more in the first 90 days" and found that assertion to be False. But given the high-profile setting of Trump’s comment -- his first formal Cabinet meeting -- we decided to take a look at his new statement. Presidential and congressional scholars aren’t any more convinced than they were in April. "Trump’s boasts are empty," said Max J. Skidmore, a University of Missouri-Kansas City political scientist who has written several books on the presidency. Legislation signed by Trump When we checked with the White House, they noted that in this remark Trump acknowledged exceptions such as Roosevelt. They also pointed to the statistics for the number of laws and executive orders signed by a president in 100 days -- a metric that Trump fares well on. Around the 100-day point of Trump’s presidency, we found that White House press secretary Sean Spicer was accurate on the numbers when he said that the current president has "worked with Congress to pass more legislation in his first 100 days than any president since (Harry) Truman." We noted that in the first 100 days of his first full term, Truman signed 55 bills; the president with the highest count since then is Trump with 28. However, none of the bills Trump had signed at that point qualified as major pieces of legislation. None of the ones since are, either. They include, among others, two federal spending bills of the sort required periodically of every president and Congress to keep the government running; a bill overhauling government-employee travel policy; a bill about the United States competing for an international expo; a measure addressing Department of Homeland Security vehicle fleets; and the official naming of a federal courthouse in Tennessee. While the White House is pursuing several major issues in Congress -- notably the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act and efforts to cut taxes and promote infrastructure -- it would be premature for Trump to take credit for these. The health care bill has passed the House but not yet passed the Senate, while the tax and infrastructure measures haven’t even gotten that far. Trump is "correct that he has signed a rather large, although not unprecedented, number of bills," Skidmore said. However, "most of the bills he has signed are routine and unimportant." Sarah Binder, a George Washington University political scientist who specializes in Congress, agreed that "the absence of significant legislative movement is glaring. Contrary to Trump's statement, this is a Republican government struggling to legislate, despite control of both chambers and the White House." By contrast, even if you set aside Franklin D. Roosevelt -- as Trump did -- other presidents signed more far-reaching legislation during their first 100 days. Bill Clinton signed the Family and Medical Leave Act, while Barack Obama signed not only a nearly $800 billion stimulus package to combat a spiraling recession but also the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and a law expanding the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Obama also implemented two urgent economic programs formally passed in the final weeks of George W. Bush’s presidency -- the Troubled Asset Relief Program and the auto industry bailout. Meanwhile, John F. Kennedy established the Peace Corps (later ratified by Congress), while Truman’s first 100 days were a whirlwind of foreign-policy actions -- the end of World War II in Europe, the writing of the United Nations charter, the dropping of two atomic bombs on Japan, and Japan’s unconditional surrender. Trump’s most significant legislative achievements may be his use of the Congressional Review Act -- a previously little-used power that makes it easier for Congress and the president to overturn federal regulations. "Some of these regulations are substantively and politically important," such as the overturning of the Stream Protection Act, an environmental regulation that Trump and others said harmed coal mining, said Gregory Koger, a University of Miami political scientist. Still, Koger added, "these definitely do not rise to the level of ‘landmark’ legislation, or even ‘major’ legislation." And John Frendreis, a political scientist at Loyola University in Chicago, added that such powers were not available to most postwar presidents, since the Congressional Review Act was only passed in the 1990s. This makes comparisons with past presidents difficult, he said. Trump’s executive orders As president, Trump has signed some three dozen executive orders, which also places him numerically above the presidents since Franklin Roosevelt. A number of these orders have addressed high-profile issues, and some could potentially have significant impacts. One -- a visa ban for individuals from certain Muslim-majority nations -- remains tied up in lawsuits and is headed to the Supreme Court. Another notable order directs the Treasury Department to stop collecting penalties related to not having health insurance. If this policy is followed and isn’t blocked by the courts, "it could cripple this aspect of the Affordable Care Act without altering the law," Frendreis said. Trump also used executive orders to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and to green-light key pipelines that had been held up by the Obama administration. And Trump also announced that the United States would be pulling out of the Paris climate agreement, though he didn’t use an executive order in that case. These are significant policy changes -- but it’s important to note some caveats about Trump’s use of executive orders. First, many of these orders started the ball rolling to overturn federal regulations, rather than overturning them in one fell swoop. Often, Congress needs to weigh in to change a law, or Cabinet departments must undertake a lengthy administrative process before policies officially change. And second, new presidents routinely issue orders during their first 100 days that overturn actions of their predecessors of the opposite party. Just two days after taking office, President Bill Clinton signed orders overturning restrictions on abortion imposed during the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations, and with equal speed, President George W. Bush overturned Clinton’s opposition to a ban on aid to international groups that participate in abortions. "Every president uses executive orders, especially when they cannot pass legislation because of a hostile Congress," Frendreis said. "So his actions here are typical, and not unusually impressive. In fact, his need to act administratively instead of legislatively implies legislative weakness, not strength, because he should be able to make policy through the legislative process since he has unified partisan control." All told, he said, "the early Trump presidency stands out in terms of the number of symbolic actions he has taken to ‘fulfill’ campaign promises, but his record of changing policy is not off to a fast start. Like all presidents, he has taken some impactful actions, but he does not stand out in this regard." Our ruling In his Cabinet meeting, Trump said that rare is the president "who's passed more legislation, who's done more things than what we've done, between the executive orders and the job-killing regulations that have been terminated." Scholars of the presidency and Congress are unconvinced that Trump’s legislative and administrative output is exceptional by historical standards. Trump has signed a relatively large number of bills so far, but comparatively few with significant impact. And while some of his executive orders have made an immediate impact, most have merely expressed his policy preferences or set in motion a process that may, or may not, change policies down the road.

pomt-05283	Since Scott Walker took office as governor in January 2011, there has been an increase of 33,200 jobs in Wisconsin.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/may/24/scott-walker/gov-walker-says-wisconsin-has-added-33200-jobs-he-/	With less than two weeks to go until the June 5, 2012, recall election pitting Gov. Scott Walker against Democratic challenger Tom Barrett, the top issues can be summed up this way: Jobs, jobs, jobs. And: jobs. Nowhere is this more clear than in a television ad from Walker that is built on new jobs numbers for 2011 that show a brighter picture than previous numbers -- including much-cited monthly tallies by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, the nation’s official scorekeeper on jobs. In the ad, which began running May 16, 2012, Walker leans into the camera and tells viewers what they have heard about jobs going down is wrong. "The government just released the final job numbers," he says, "and as it turns out Wisconsin actually gained -- that’s right, gained -- more than 20,000 new jobs during my first year in office." He goes on: "Add the jobs created this year, and the total grows to over 30,000." There has been a blitz of job-related claims and counter-claims. We have already done items on several to help sort out the various aspects of what is being said. In this item, we are focusing on the claim Walker has made about how many jobs have been created. Is he right? One of our principles is that we rate statements based on the information available when they are made. For instance, when Barrett blamed Walker for worst-in-the-nation job losses from March 2011 to March 2012, we noted he was correct based on the official numbers at the time, but wrong to pin the blame solely on Walker and his policies. We rated the claim Half True. In the new Walker ad, two sets of words appear on the screen as the governor speaks. One quotes from a Journal Sentinel article and reads: "... a gain of 23,321 jobs between Dec. 2010 and Dec. 2011 ..." A second slide says "33,200 total new jobs." This is the figure Walker settles on and what we’re examining. How did Walker arrive at the numbers? Walker begins with the new numbers his administration submitted to the federal government May 16, 2012, the day the ad began. They are based on a required quarterly census of state employers. Walker compares the December 2011 numbers to the December 2010 numbers, to get 23,321. This is the same number included in the Journal Sentinel article the TV ad cites, which is understandable: The administration provided them to a reporter May 15, 2012, the day before it announced the census numbers that had been sent to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Walker then takes monthly numbers from the start of 2012, about 10,000, adds them to the numbers from 2011 and arrives at the 33,200 figure. Simple, right? Not really. The 2011 numbers are based on the jobs census, which covers about 95 percent of employers. They are deemed more accurate than the monthly numbers, which are based on a survey of sample of about 3.5% of employers, then extrapolated to get a state number. At various times Walker has touted and criticized these monthly numbers, depending on whether they have shown an increase or a decrease. And these are the numbers Barrett and Democrats have cited to argue the state is losing jobs under Walker. The BLS itself recognizes the census method as more accurate. Indeed, it uses those numbers to update the monthly numbers. Think of it as a picture that over time comes into sharper focus. The problems: -- The 2011 numbers are not final. They will be reviewed by the BLS and can change, though typically they do not change by a large amount. The normal procedure is the state gathers the employment data from more than 90 percent of state businesses -- some 160,000 -- and then submits it to the feds for review, said Abdur Chowdhury, chairman of the Marquette University economics department. "They vet the data and correct any mistakes in calculations," he said of the feds. "Sometimes the mistakes are very small, sometimes they are very large." -- The two sets of numbers are collected differently. If not an apples and oranges comparison, Walker is certainly mixing two different varieties of apples. They eventually will be combined by federal officials -- the census numbers will be the new basis for the monthly numbers as the ever-changing picture is updated. But this won’t happen for some time. Of course, that’s not satisfying for Walker who wants to highlight the numbers -- or for voters who must factor in progress on jobs (Walker’s top 2010 campaign promise was to create 250,000 new private-sector jobs over four years) before the recall vote. How do we evaluate them? First, the numbers provide the best current estimate for 2011 and the most recent 2012 count, so they offer a sense of where things stand. While the 2011 numbers are not yet "official," they are real numbers submitted by the state to the BLS. (We separately rated a claim by Barrett that the numbers were "just dreamed up" as False.) Chowdhury said the numbers released by Walker should be considered "raw data" because they have not been reviewed by the BLS. They are not, he said, the "final" numbers for 2011 employment. (We separately rated the claim in the ad by Walker that these were the "final numbers" as False.) When we asked Walker’s campaign about the numbers, spokeswoman Ciara Matthews said, "That’s the best data available to us." Barrett spokesman Phil Walzak noted the new 2011 numbers "raised some serious questions" because "they can't be verified and they won't be verified until after the election." He also noted that the Journal Sentinel story about them said never has there been such a large swing -- 57,000 -- between earlier numbers showing job losses and Walker's new numbers showing job gains. Are the April numbers included? The Walker campaign did not respond to efforts to clarify which set of numbers for 2012 were used. That is, was it the numbers for the first three months -- January, February, March? These were the latest released at the time the ad debuted, on May 16, 2012. Or the first four months, including April? Those monthly numbers were announced by the BLS the next day. When Matthews stopped responding to our questions on this point, we tried numerous ways to get the 2011 and 2012 numbers to add up as they do in the ad. The approach that came closest to the number used in the ad was using the January to April monthly numbers for public- and private-sector jobs. When added to the 2011 number, which also was for all jobs, it would mean an increase since he took office of 33,421. That compares with the 33,200 used. The April numbers actually showed a drop from March. Had the March numbers been used, the total cited in the ad could have been higher, about 39,600. Finally, there is the question of how much Walker is crediting his own policies as leading to the new numbers. A governor -- like a mayor -- has little control over national economic trends such as a severe recession. And any policy changes implemented in response take time to be felt. Thus, when we have evaluated similar claims in the past, the Truth-O-Meter winds up somewhere in the middle, often as Half True. In the ad, Walker presents the numbers as just the guv sharing good news. It’s not a full-throated credit-me approach. But in highlighting his own success and urging viewers to continue his policies, implicit in the claim is a statement taking credit for the improving numbers. What’s more, Walker has acknowledged the numbers were released in an unusual manner. Without the early release, they would not be out until well after the election. So, it is to his political benefit to release -- and tout -- them now. Thus, that deserves a big asterisk any time the numbers are cited. Indeed, the article the ad cites as support for the 2011 numbers includes all of these cautionary notes -- but in isolating a few words from the article the ad snips them out for more advantage. Our rating Walker’s ad says there are 33,200 more jobs in Wisconsin since he took office. To reach the number, he combined two data sets -- one that involves unofficial (but generally more accurate) numbers that could change in the weeks after the election; the other is volatile, but still official monthly numbers. From an accounting standpoint this would be flagged as a mistake. From a political standpoint, he is mixing and matching to present the best possible view. Walker presents it all as final and official, offering no cautionary notes or caveats -- even though there are many. And Walker credits his policies for the improvement, which overstates the impact a governor can make on broad economic trends in a short period of time. There is clearly some truth to the numbers. But in mixing everything together and not making it clear these numbers are preliminary, Walker ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That is our definition for Mostly False.

pomt-06498	Says he never called teachers "thugs" and has said nothing but "great things" about them during the fight over his curbs on unions	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/oct/13/scott-walker/walkers-praise-teachers-not-all-encompassing/	At the NBC News "Education Nation" summit in New York City on Sept. 26, 2011, anchor Brian Williams put Republican Gov. Scott Walker on the hot seat over his cuts to school funding in the 2011-’13 budget. Williams opened by saying that among the 10 governors on the panel, only Walker was the subject of a social-media campaign questioning NBC’s decision to include him -- with one Twitter post Williams read comparing it with "having an arsonist talk about fire safety." Then he read from a letter sent to NBC by Wisconsin educator Heather DuBois Bourenane. The letter expressed shock that they were "featuring Scott ‘Teachers are Thugs’ Walker at the summit." Twice in the minutes that followed, Williams pushed Walker hard on the origin of "teachers are thugs" reference. Had Walker said it in the heat of the protests over his successful push to sharply curtail collective bargaining rights for teachers and other public employees? Walker first said it "came from the Internet and everything else" and later flatly denied saying it. He then went further, as he described his encounters with teachers around the state. "I’d have an open forum for an hour with teachers at our schools and they’d say, ‘Why are you pickin’ on teachers?’ And I’d say, ‘Go back to NBC, go back to YouTube, go back to all the statements I’ve made earlier this year and you’ll never find one time when I’ve said anything but great things about our teachers.’" He continued: "The teachers who teach not only my kids but all the other children across the state of Wisconsin, are great public servants. What I’m doing is long term, it’s making a structural change so that more of them can stay in our classrooms." Let’s see … high-profile statement, check. Strong comments, check. Important topic, check. A dispute over what was said, check. Yes, this is one for PolitiFact. So, is Walker right on the "thugs" comment and that he only had positive things to say about teachers? First, "teachers are thugs." It’s worth noting that prominent public officials -- as well as many political commentators -- have freely applied the term "thug" to aspects of the 2011 collective bargaining battle. U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, said death threats were "thuggery," while former U.S. Rep. Dave Obey, D-Wausau, said Walker’s move against unions itself was "political thuggery." Bloggers saw "thuggery" everywhere. In the damage done to the Capitol grounds. In the prank phone call made to Walker. In Walker telling that caller he considered planting troublemakers among protesters. They also saw itin a union-supported boycott of pro-Walker businesses. In protesters’ angry confrontation with Republican state Sen. Glenn Grothman. And in a GOP open records request for emails sent by a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor who compared Walker’s "style" to Joe McCarthy’s. But did Scott Walker say "teachers are thugs"? Certainly not in the sharp way that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie did in an April 2011 interview with ABC News about teachers there. "I believe the teachers in New Jersey in the main are wonderful public servants that care deeply," Christie said. "But their union, their union are a group of political thugs." We could find no instance of Walker directly addressing teachers -- or their union -- in that fashion. We did, though, find one instance in which Walker used a form of "thug" in discussing the reaction to his limits on unions. It came in a March 10 appearance on conservative talk host Sean Hannity’s TV show immediately after Republican lawmakers approved Walker’s legislation, ending a stalemate with Senate Democrats who fled to Illinois and blocked a vote for more than three weeks. Hannity asked Walker about "mayhem" at the Capitol, which was occupied for weeks by protesters. Hannity specifically mentioned Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald calling the Capitol "unsafe" for lawmakers trying to get to work, as well as reports of death threats against senators and protests outside Walker’s Wauwatosa house. Walker answered: "People should not be coming into the state trying to intimidate lawmakers, offer up threats or anything else. That’s just not the way it’s done, at least not in the Midwest. And thankfully, again, our lawmakers stood up to those sorts of thuggery attacks, and we’re not going to allow that here in the state of Wisconsin. We can have good civil debate." He added: "The people who work for state and local government have been decent, and I respect them throughout this process. But the people coming in from other states, that bring these sorts of tactics, just don’t belong here." In the view of the state’s largest teachers union, the "thuggery" remark was aimed in part at teachers. "Wisconsin teachers were a big part of the collective actions at the start of the movement he’s referring to -- and his take that there was ‘thuggery’ involved, and that it was out-of-state protesters driving these actions, was way off the mark," said Christina Brey, spokeswoman for the Wisconsin Education Association Council. But Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie said the governor was not talking about teachers when he denounced "thuggery attacks." He said Walker was referring to death threats from out-of-state people. A multitude of threats of various kinds were cataloged by conservative observers and the mainstream media during the protests. In our view, it’s clear Walker directed the comment at what he characterized as out-of-state protesters, without specifically mentioning teachers or the teachers union. He didn’t exclude teachers, though. We asked DuBois Bourenane, the letter writer to NBC, about the "teachers as thugs" moniker she gave Walker. She is a post-secondary instructor whose Monologues of Dissent blog frequently blasts Walker as an enemy of public education. She joined in many of the protests at the Capitol, appeared on MSNBC’s "The Ed Show," and has blanketed Walker’s office with dozens of long, critical emails. She told us it was not meant to suggest that Walker ever said those exact words, but merely a device to highlight her view that Walker disrespects teachers. "I never said he said that and I’d be surprised if he did," she told us. "But I do think he actively promotes a rhetorical discourse that promotes the impression that teachers who disagree with his policies are bad for schools and dangerous and subversive." This gets us to part two of this fact check. To gauge Walker’s rhetoric regarding teachers, we examined dozens of Walker statements on education, on unions and on the Capitol protests that teachers figured so prominently in. During the 2010 campaign, Walker made clear he felt public schools -- and specifically underperforming teachers -- were failing Wisconsin’s students. On his campaign website, he called for teacher evaluations, merit pay and other measures, without mentioning his plan to severely limit collective bargaining. He touted an expansion of voucher and charter schools. But he also made clear the "vast majority" of teachers are succeeding, when he released his education plan during the 2010 campaign. After his election, Walker pressed the case against union rules. In a Wall Street Journal opinion column, Walker wrote that the teachers union "hid behind" a labor contract when an award-winning first-year teacher was laid off because of seniority rules under collective bargaining. In February 2011, after Walker unveiled his union limits and benefits cuts, major school districts across the state shut down when teachers flocked to protests in Madison. Walker praised the "good professionals "who went to work and said those who skipped out had every right to be heard, "but I said I’m not going to allow for one minute the voices of the tens of thousands here to somehow overpower the millions of hardworking taxpayers of my state who know what were asking for is modest." He was less diplomatic when referring to the teachers union. He told conservative talk show host Mark Levin on Feb. 21, 2011, that the union’s motivation was only to get its hands on teachers’ dues payments. By announcing it would give in to Walker’s benefits cuts if he would drop the limits on collective bargaining, "they threw their members under the bus," he said. The same day, Walker told Hannity that Republicans were "not going to be intimidated" by tens of thousands of protesters from Chicago, Nevada and New Jersey. (PolitiFact Wisconsin rated False Walker’s Feb. 22 claim that "almost all" the protesters were from outside Wisconsin at that point, while noting that Illinois teachers unions had sent buses of protesters to Madison.) In late February and early March, as the standoff with Democrats dragged on, Walker used a series of news releases to highlight deals that teachers had negotiated through their union -- or won in arbitration -- on pay, retirement benefits, overtime and working conditions. Some of the releases singled out small but attention-grabbing items in particular districts. One was, "Almost $10,000 Per Year for Doing Nothing," a reference to a teacher emeritus program. Another was "Arbitrator Reinstates Porn-Watching Teacher." Another: "$6,000 Extra for Carrying a Pager." Walker has taken steps to assert that he and his budget were pro-teacher. He frequently praises the public school teachers his two sons have encountered in Wauwatosa, and other outstanding teachers elsewhere. At the NBC summit, Walker repeated his respect for teachers. "I understand there’s sometimes a difference of opinion, but in the end, we believe the right thing to do is put the power in the hands of the teachers," he said. Brey, the statewide teachers union spokeswoman, says WEAC’s main beef with Walker is his actions, not his words. But she said Walker uses his words to depict unions as greedy (seeking an "expensive entitlement"); controlled by intimidating out-of-state "bosses"; and incompetent (with union hiring restrictions gone, Walker says, now we can keep the best teachers). Criticism of the union, Brey contends, amounts to criticism of teachers, who elect their union representatives. In our view, both sides have a gripe. Teachers who belong to the union feel aggrieved by Walker’s comments about their union. But being critical of a group is not the same as being critical of individuals, and it’s a stretch to call Walker’s calls for educational reform and school choice an attack on teachers, per se. On the other hand, it’s disingenuous for the governor to suggest that his praise of teachers is all-encompassing, but that when he’s talking about the protesters -- even mischaracterizing them as dominated by out-of-state interests -- and teachers organizations, it is limited. Our conclusion At the NBC Education Summit, Walker denied saying "teachers are thugs" and said he’s only said "great thing" about teachers. Though we looked at two pieces of the statement, it essentially amounts to single claim -- that he’s only praised teachers. There’s no evidence at all that he used the thug line -- and even the educator whose letter prompted the questioning doesn’t believe he said it. He did use the term "thuggery attacks" in response to a question about the protesters’ occupation of the Capitol, death threats against elected officials and protests outside his home. Many Wisconsin educators joined in that occupation, but Walker says he was referring only to death threats by out-of-state people. On the larger point of his rhetoric about teachers, we found Walker was careful about expressing his respect for teachers and other protesters, while offering criticism of the union that represents them. So, Walker can accurately claim he has avoided direct rhetorical attacks on teachers as a profession. But we found Walker said less than "great things" about the union that represents teachers, and in his "thuggery" comment Walker left room for teachers to assume he was passing judgment on their protests at the Capitol. Walker’s statement may be narrowly accurate, but it slips down the Truth-O-Meter when you examine the full context of his comments about the teachers union, teacher benefits and the protests. Taken as a whole, his comments fall short of the high bar he set about saying only "great things." We rate his statement Half True.

Last week we ruled True a statement by the Oregon Republican Party that Republican Rob Cornilles had the endorsements of a variety of local mayors, including Democrat, Republican and Independent. The upper case "I" means he had the backing of a registered member of the Independent Party of Oregon, which is a third party group. Well, we were wrong. We checked Cornilles’ list of mayors online, and confirmed their party registration. As we suspected, most are Republican. But we found six non-Republicans, including three registered Democrats. We originally emailed Amity Mayor Michael Cape and asked him if he was registered with the Independent Party, as opposed to being a non-affiliated voter. He said yes. But it turns out that he’s actually a non-affiliated voter. The Independent Party of Oregon was officially recognized by the Secretary of State in January 2007. Previously, people registered with no party could call themselves independent voters. Now they best stick to calling themselves non-affiliated voters. Cape said in a later interview that he considered himself independent, as in neither Republican nor Democratic. This is a confusing issue. When we first contacted the Yamhill clerk’s office, a person there said Cape was registered as Other-Independent. Which is not the same as registering with the Independent Party. Had the Oregon Republican Party used a lower case "i" they would have been accurate. They say that’s what they intended all along. But capitalization makes a difference.

Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat misinformation. The story quotes Stone as saying that even though she originally wanted Hillary Clinton to win the 2016 presidential election, she has come to realize that America made a great choice electing Trump. That didn’t happen. In reality, Stone called the results of the 2016 election "incredibly painful." Clinton and Stone have also been photographed together backstage at the Late Show with Stephen Colbert. The story includes a doctored image of Stone wearing a "Make America Great Again" hat. It was photoshopped from a real photo taken of her at Disneyland in 2015. Stone was wearing a navy blue hat with a Mickey Mouse logo, but the article removed the logo replacing it with Trump’s campaign slogan. The article also claims that Stone stated that she is not usually involved in politics. Though Stone has said that she has stayed quiet in publicly expressing her opinions, she has recently said that she is speaking out more often. Stone has supported equal pay for men and women and Planned Parenthood. When searching for the quotes attributed to Stone in the article, we found no results.

pomt-13957	"The Obama administration was actively supporting Al Qaeda in Iraq, the terrorist group that became the Islamic State."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/15/donald-trump/donald-trump-suggests-barack-obama-supported-isis-/	In a series of comments designed to cast doubt on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump has charged that the Obama administration has actively supported the Islamic extremist group that became ISIS. In this fact-check, we’ll begin by recapping what Trump said. Then we’ll look at whether he has any evidence to support the allegation. (The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry.) What Trump said It all began with a June 13 interview with Fox & Friends, when Trump said, "Look, we're led by a man that either is not tough, not smart, or he's got something else in mind. And the something else in mind — you know, people can't believe it. People cannot, they cannot believe that President Obama is acting the way he acts and can't even mention the words 'radical Islamic terrorism.' There's something going on. It's inconceivable." Trump, as we have previously detailed, declined to clarify what he meant in a subsequent interview on NBC’s Today show. He said, "Well, there are a lot of people that think maybe he doesn't want to get it. A lot of people think maybe he doesn't want to know about it. I happen to think that he just doesn't know what he's doing, but there are many people that think maybe he doesn't want to get it. He doesn't want to see what's really happening. And that could be." Then, on June 14, Trump told the Associated Press that Obama "claims to know our enemy, and yet he continues to prioritize our enemy over our allies, and for that matter, the American people." A day later, Trump tweeted, "An: Media fell all over themselves criticizing what DonaldTrump "may have insinuated about @POTUS." But he's right." The tweet then linked to a Breitbart story that began, "Hillary Clinton received a classified intelligence report stating that the Obama administration was actively supporting Al Qaeda in Iraq, the terrorist group that became the Islamic State." Finally, later that day, Trump posted on Facebook, "Hillary Clinton --- is CROOKED! Hillary Clinton received a classified intelligence report stating that the Obama administration was actively supporting Al Qaeda in Iraq, the terrorist group that became the Islamic State." This post also linked to the Breitbart article. The 2012 intelligence memo The story on the conservative website Breitbart was based on a classified and partially redacted U.S. intelligence document written in August 2012 and released last year as a result of a lawsuit by the group Judicial Watch. The document outlines what is known about "the general situation" on the ground in Syria and Iraq after the rebellion against the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad. In that context, the document refers, among other groups, to al-Qaida in Iraq, or AQI, which eventually morphed into ISIS, sometimes called the Islamic State or ISIL. The document calls AQI one of a few "major forces driving the insurgency in Syria." Specifically, it said, "AQI supported the Syrian opposition from the beginning, both ideologically and through the media. AQI declared its opposition (to) Assad’s government because it considered it a sectarian regime targeting Sunnis." (As background, AQI and ISIS are part of the Sunni branch of Islam, which is often in conflict with the Shia branch.) Meanwhile, the document said that "the West, Gulf countries and Turkey support the opposition, while Russia, China and Iran support the regime." The significance of the memo Trump sees the memo as the smoking gun that demonstrates U.S. support for ISIS or its predecessor group. But that’s not the case. Rather, experts say it means that the United States shared an overarching goal with the opposition -- namely, countering Assad -- without actively supporting all elements of that opposition. In the byzantine world of the Syrian opposition, the United States sought to support moderate elements while opposing extremists such as AQI and, later, ISIS. The White House firmly rejected the notion that the United States actively supported either AQI or ISIS, noting the number of terrorists the administration has killed, including major leadership figures. "We, in conjunction with our Iraqi partners, relentlessly pursued and ultimately degraded AQI with every tool in our arsenal -- including military force," said Ned Price, a spokesman for the White House’s National Security Council. "And, of course, the fact that we eliminated AQI's leader, Abu Ayyub al-Masri in a joint U.S.-Iraqi raid leaves no doubt about our determination to rid Iraq of this group." Independent experts agreed with the White House. "The United States has never backed AQI and has never backed ISIS," said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a terrorism expert at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. "It was never part of the opposition that the United States supported, full stop." Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, agreed. "It has never been the policy or stated goal of the Obama administration to arm or assist al-Qaida," he said. "I would say it's another unsupportable conspiracy theory," said John Limbert, an international affairs professor at the U.S. Naval Academy who previously served as a foreign service officer in post-war Iraq and as deputy coordinator for counterterrorism in the State Department. John Pike, the director of globalsecurity.org, said it would be putting it "mildly" to call it a conspiracy theory. And Gartenstein-Ross also used that term, tweeting that Trump’s effort to make this argument was a "transparently fallacious conspiracy theory." A point Trump could have made, but didn’t Ironically, experts say, Trump could have made a different point against the Obama administration's Syria policy. Gartenstein-Ross has written about the perils of the administration’s attempts to identify and support potential allies from the motley ranks of the opposition. The effort, he wrote, ended up "benefiting the very jihadist groups the U.S. has been fighting for the past 15 years." Specifically, the policy of arming and promoting Sunni rebel groups fighting the Assad regime ended up indirectly helping the al Nusra Front, an al-Qaida affiliate in Syria, Landis said. Al Nusra was "allied with many of the leaders that the U.S. did arm or assist," Landis said. And other rebel groups were overrun by al Nusra, he added, even having to surrender their U.S.-provided arms to the al-Qaida affiliate on occasion. The difference with what Trump said is that these developments were unintended -- and unwanted -- side effects of the United States’ policy, not a goal of it. "I think our policy has been both foolish and tragic, but it doesn’t make the argument from Breitbart true," Gartenstein-Ross said. Our ruling Trump said "the Obama administration was actively supporting Al Qaeda in Iraq, the terrorist group that became the Islamic State." U.S. efforts to court "moderate" opponents of Assad may have benefited other Islamic extremist groups such as al Nusra, but any such benefits were an unintended consequence of U.S. policy, not a goal of that policy itself. That’s different from the argument made by Trump -- that the U.S. was actively supporting ISIS or its predecessors. In fact, experts say that assertion is flat wrong. The implication that the Obama administration was actively helping the United States' enemies is ridiculous. It has always been U.S. policy to oppose AQI and ISIS, and the United States has aggressively fought the group for years.

pomt-03522	Wisconsin has "one of the most progressive tax codes in the country."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jun/02/dale-kooyenga/kooyenga-says-wisconsins-income-taxes-stand-out-na/	The author of a Wisconsin income tax overhaul sees the flat tax in the Flatland to the south as a beacon for Republicans trying to ease the Badger State’s heavy tax burden on the middle class. "We have a long ways to go in Wisconsin," state Rep. Dale Kooyenga, R-Brookfield, told reporters. "Everyone in Illinois pays 5 percent. Illinois millionaires … pay less of a rate in taxes than Wisconsin’s lower income, middle-class families." Researchers deem Illinois’ personal income tax structure "regressive" because a uniform tax rate ultimately takes a bigger bite from lower incomes than higher ones. Wisconsin pioneered the opposite approach, a "progressive" system in which tax rates rise with earnings. Kooyenga argues change is long overdue. "Wisconsin was the first state to enact an income tax in 1911," he wrote in a May 27, 2013 posting on the conservative Right Wisconsin website. "The complexity of the Wisconsin tax code has exponentially grown as Madison politicians believed the tax code was their magic wand which could be used to accomplish political and social objectives." His conclusion: "As a direct result, our tax code picks winners and losers and is one of the most progressive tax codes in the country." Kooyenga’s plan reduces rates and collapses several tax brackets. It comes on top of Gov. Scott Walker’s tax-cut proposal. Combined they reduce taxes by nearly $790 million over two years. Top earners would likely receive the majority of the $444 million in tax savings under Kooyenga’s plan, and those with modest incomes would land in the same tax bracket as very high earners, the Journal Sentinel reported. Kooyenga acknowledges that, but says everyone deserves tax relief and that the top 10 percent right now pay over 50 percent of the tax revenue in Wisconsin. But Kooyenga’s claim wasn’t about the impact of his plan. Rather it was about the tax system as it stands today. Does Wisconsin have "one of the most progressive tax codes in the country"? The rankings Kooyenga’s plan focuses on the personal income tax, so we’ll confine our analysis to that rather than all taxes in the code. We found two 50-state studies comparing income tax burdens by income level, and Kooyenga cited the same research when we asked him for backup. A March 2013 study of 2010 tax data by the non-partisan Minnesota Center for Fiscal Excellence, a research organization, concluded that: -- Among 42 states with an income tax (and the District of Columbia), Wisconsin is the 9th most-progressive when comparing married couples with $10,000 of gross income to those with incomes of $150,000, $250,000, $500,000 and $1 million. -- Wisconsin’s ranking drops lower, in a range from 11th to 15th "most progressive," when comparing a couple earning $35,000 to each of those four higher levels. The ranks were 11, 12, 15 and 15. Minnesota came in number 2. The second study cited by Kooyenga is a January 2013 examination by the nonpartisan, liberal Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) in Washington, D.C. (The group is a partner organization to Citizens for Tax Justice, which has criticized the Walker and Kooyenga tax cuts as costly and regressive. Also, on May 30, 2013, ITEP released a review of Kooyenga’s plan, concluding that the top 20 percent of earners, a group with an average income of $183,000, would receive more than two-thirds of the benefit.) In any event, the group’s earlier 50-state study -- the one cited by Kooyenga to back up his claim -- found that Wisconsin’s income tax was the 12th most progressive in the nation. That ranking is not revealed in the report, which deals with a broader variety of state and local taxes, but the group made it available to us from its unpublished database. So, the two studies rank the income tax here in a range from 9th to 15th most progressive. That puts Wisconsin among the top 21 to 36 percent of "most progressive" income tax states, depending on the comparison point and the study. Of course, that’s just among the state’s that levy a personal income tax -- the tax that is the main way to add a progressive element to a tax system. Four states that don’t levy a personal income tax are on the ITEP’s top-10 "most regressive" list for their overall tax systems, so it’s safe to say Wisconsin’s income tax approach is more progressive than in those additional states that don’t even use this progressive tool. Of the two studies, the ITEP research is more up to date, but is limited to non-elderly taxpayers. It, unlike the Minnesota study, accounted for the effect of reductions that Walker initiated in 2011 in the earned income tax credit for low-income workers, a cut of 19 percent, or $56 million over two years. That change made the income tax less progressive, but we don’t know how it affected Wisconsin’s ranking vs. other states, some of whom made similar changes. Digging deeper From the ITEP study, Kooyenga highlighted tables showing that Wisconsin’s top 20 percent of earners pay an effective income tax rate considerably higher than the national average. Similarly, for the lowest 20 percent, Wisconsin’s burden is lower than the 50-state average. That’s true, and it demonstrates the progressive nature of the Wisconsin system. The progressive income tax offsets the regressive effect, for example, of the sales tax. Aside from the graduated rate structure that rises with income, the state’s sliding standard deduction is "powerfully progressive," as is the itemized deduction credit, notes Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance president Todd Berry. But the ITEP study also shows that by the time earnings reach an average of $28,000, Wisconsin’s personal income tax bite is already over the national average for the second 20 percent. PolitiFact Wisconsin in November 2012 reviewed a claim by state Rep. Robin Vos that on income taxes, "Wisconsin is one of the best places in the country to be poor but "top 4 or 5 worst" for middle-income earners. We rated it Mostly True. Wisconsin, in the 2013 ITEP study, is not singled out as at the very highest end as either progressive or regressive. "Unlike most states, Wisconsin allows a large capital gains tax break," ITEP executive director Matthew Gardner wrote in an email. "Since the benefits of this tax break go primarily to the best-off taxpayers, the capital gains tax break makes Wisconsin’s income tax much less progressive than you would think from just looking at the tax rates." Gardner said it would be reasonable to say that Wisconsin is in the upper tier of "least regressive" states based on its #12 ranking. But, in his view, "it’s hard to describe the Wisconsin income tax -- or the tax system as a whole -- as among the ‘most progressive’ in the US." In the Minnesota study, the rankings drop quite a bit when the comparison income is set at $35,000 instead of $10,000. The reason for that is related to the tax credits for very low earners that we mentioned earlier. Wisconsin has a prominent credit, helping to account for its progressive ranking. Such credits phase out as income rises, however, so those people would have a tax liability, unlike lower earners whose bill is wiped out by the credit, said Aaron Twait, research director at the Minnesota center. A few other states keep the credits in place at higher incomes, bumping up their "progressive" rating. Kooyenga could have balanced off some of the regressive effect of his plan by increasing tax credits for very low-income earners. But he notes that many workers in that category receive the credit even though they did not earn enough wages to have Wisconsin taxes withheld. It’s a wage supplement in the form of a refund. That, in Kooyenga’s view, is one of the inappropriate "social objectives" in the tax code, his office told us. Our rating PItching his plan to begin flattening the Wisconsin state income tax code, Kooyenga said Wisconsin has "one of the most progressive tax codes in the country." Kooyenga was talking about income taxes, and it’s clear from two national studies that Wisconsin’s tax is more progressive than two-thirds to four-fifths of the states that levy such a tax, depending on the study. So Wisconsin is clearly in the upper tier, but not in elite of the elite. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Dale Kooyenga	None	None	None	2013-06-02T09:00:00	2013-05-27	['None']
pomt-04427	Signs letter saying Consumer Product Safety Commission is acting "without consultation or input from the company" to stop the sale of Buckyballs.	false	/tennessee/statements/2012/oct/15/phil-roe/roe-letter-claims-consumer-commission-stopping-buc/	Buckyballs and Buckycubes, tiny rare earth magnets manufactured in China and sold by the Maxfield & Oberton Co. of New York, are intended to be adult desk toys. They’re marketed as "the amazing magnetic desk toys you can’t put down," and have received rave reviews in magazines like Maxim, Wired, Esquire and People. They’ve also been swallowed by children and have been the cause of emergency surgeries. In July, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, in filing only its second administrative complaint in 11 years, charged that their design poses a "substantial risk of injury to the public." U.S. Reps. Marsha Blackburn and Phil Roe, both R-Tenn., and five other members of Congress, wrote to President Obama on Oct. 1, saying the CPSC "is penalizing our nation’s brightest innovators and job creators through excessive and selective enforcement." The congressmen go on to say that they learned of the Buckyballs case during a recent hearing. They say CPSC "overreach and lack of flexibility has virtually eliminated these products and the jobs associated with their sales and distribution." They ask the president to review the case and for the CPSC to continue to work cooperatively with the company. They point out that 2.5 million of the small magnetic cube and ball toys have been sold in the past three years. Then they say that the "CPSC is working, without consultation or input from the company, to eliminate this product by stopping the sale of their products by directly approaching its retail partners and requesting a recall." We asked Blackburn’s communications director, Mike Reynard, for supporting evidence that the agency was acting without consultation or input from the company. After conferring with staffers, Reynard sent a USA Today story indicating the CPSC has been intervening with retailers to end sales of the magnets as it pursues its lawsuit. He said the lawsuit itself showed the agency is "done working with the company." In a followup email message, Reynard wrote: "You can't say you're working with someone when you are actively suing them to kill their product. That might be the administration's idea of a cooperative working relationship but it isn't for most Americans and business owners. CPSC should be working with Buckyballs to resolve any concerns around these limited cases when compared to the 2.5 million units sold. Clearly they have pushed to get this product off shelves as the USA Today story confirms specific vendors who have pulled the product." Roe spokeswoman Tiffany McGuffee said Roe takes the same position. Then we looked at the lengthy letter from Maxfield & Oberton CEO Craig Zucker laying out its case against the CPSC’s actions. It notes the "extraordinary lengths" the company has taken to prevent misuse of its products, including "warnings, education, labeling, retailer sales restrictions and continuous cooperation with the CPSC – right up until literally the moment they turned on us." Zucker’s letter explains the toys went on sale in March 2009 and were originally labeled for use by those 13 and older. When the federal rules for children’s games changed to include those 14 and older, the company entered into a May 2010 voluntary recall of all the toys with the original labeling. It went on to create a "comprehensive safety program" and began labeling the toys with a warning: "Keep Away From All Children." The company also required retailers to agree to rules for placement of its products in their stores, with new signs. It designed a Magnet Safety website in March of this year and met with three CPSC commissioners and staff in April to discuss the expanded safety program. The company also created a medical advisory group and, along with its competitors, created the Coalition for Magnet Safety. But on July 10, the commission voted 3-1 to file the administrative complaint after, it said, "discussions with the company and its representatives failed to result in a voluntary recall plan that CPSC considered to be adequate." The CPSC said that, despite the warnings and labeling, people were still ingesting the magnets, sometimes after placing them on tongues or on cheeks to resemble piercings. The CPSC warned that when two magnets are swallowed, they can be attracted to each other through stomach or intestinal walls, resulting in serious injury requiring surgery. CPSC spokesman Scott Wolfson said in an interview that gastroenterologists have said the injuries often resemble "a gunshot to the gut" but without entrance or exit wounds. Wolfson noted that both Maxfield & Oberton and a Denver-based company, Zen Magnets, were sued after they failed to provide adequate suggestions for making their products safer. They were the first such complaints since the Arkansas-based Daisy BB gun company was sued in 2001. "Due to the number of ingestion incidents received by CPSC staff since the 2010 recall announcement and 2011 safety alert, CPSC staff seeks the remedies outlined in the complaint to stop further incidents and injuries to children," the agency said in a statement. Those remedies include stopping the sale of the toys and providing consumers with refunds. Our ruling Blackburn, Roe and their fellow letter writers are concerned that the "nation’s brightest innovators and job creators" are being penalized by an overzealous consumer protection agency. We’ll leave it to others to determine whether the sellers of Chinese magnetic balls qualify as the nation’s "brightest innovators," and also decline to determine the truth of the letter writers’ assertion that the agency’s first administrative complaints in 11 years suggest "excessive and selective enforcement." Those are opinions, but it is possible to see whether the CPSC failed to consult or seek input from the company. The lengthy record laid out by the company’s CEO establishes there was, in fact, much consultation leading up the agency’s conclusion that the toys are inherently unsafe. We rule the Congress members’ statement False.	None	Phil Roe	None	None	None	2012-10-15T03:00:00	2012-10-01	['None']
pomt-05271	On transportation financing	half flip	/new-jersey/statements/2012/may/27/chris-christie/christie-administration-backtracks-borrowing-trans/	New Jersey’s governor often portrays himself as a man of his word. Before taking office he vowed he wouldn’t raise taxes on millionaires and so far, he hasn’t. He’s also taken on the New Jersey Education Association by pledging to reform tenure and funding, infuriating numerous educators, administrators and legislators from Hackensack to Cape May. So it might seem surprising that the governor known for slashing budgets, requiring public employees to contribute more to healthcare and pension costs, and putting a chokehold on various types of aid is changing his tune a bit on one of his major funding concerns: transportation. The change is inconsistent with past statements made by Christie so we’re putting that change to the Flip-O-Meter. The Flip-O-Meter rates politicians' consistency on particular topics from No Flip to Full Flop. The meter is not intended to pass judgment on their decisions to change their minds. It gauges whether they did. Christie’s stance changed with Wednesday’s announcement that the administration will borrow an extra $260 million for transportation projects. That’s contrary to a Christie announcement more than a year ago that through his transportation capital plan, the state would begin relying less on borrowing for that type of work. From a state Department of Transportation news release on Jan. 6, 2011: "Today, we are continuing to put New Jersey on the path towards fiscal health and proposing a sensible and responsible plan that prioritizes vital transportation projects, while limiting the already-heavy debt burden carried by the taxpayers of our state." So what happened? Call it a miscalculation of sorts. Both the Christie administration and David Rosen, chief budget officer for the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services, are estimating revenue shortfalls in the budget that will ultimately mean Christie has less available cash to give to transportation. Christie’s revenue shortfall is $676 million through the end of the next fiscal year, while Rosen’s is $1.3 billion. That’s a difference of about $600 million between shortfall predictions. Christie’s original transportation capital plan for FY 2012-2013 called for borrowing $986 million and using $260 million cash in 2013. Now, New Jersey will borrow the $260 million instead, increasing the total amount borrowed to $1.2 billion. The $260 million in cash in addition to other cost-saving measures would help plug the revenue shortfall and allow the administration to kick off an across-the-board 10 percent income tax cut. But Martin E. Robins, director emeritus of the Alan M. Voorhees Transportation Center at Rutgers University, told The Star-Ledger on Wednesday, "We’re really falling right back into the capital financing that the governor critized Jon Corzine for." Despite the move to increase transportation borrowing, State Treasurer Andrew Sidamon-Eristoff emphasized that the governor’s original goal to lessen reliance on bonding for transportation remains. "This is a one-year initiative, and we do not make this recommendation casually," Sidamon-Eristoff said at an Assembly Budget Committee hearing Wednesday. Our ruling Christie has stated previously that he wants the state to rely less on borrowing for transportation projects and in January 2011 announced a transportation capital plan that calls for more pay-as-you-go financing. But now he’s saying the state will borrow an additional $260 million for transportation work next year in part because of projected revenue shortfalls in the state budget. The governor’s about-face is inconsistent with his previous statements, which rates the change a Half Flip on the Flip-O-Meter. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.

pomt-09956	ACORN "could get up to $8.5 billion more tax dollars despite being under investigation for voter registration fraud in a dozen states."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/21/michele-bachmann/bachmann-claims-acorn-has-access-85-billion-federa/	U.S. Rep. Michelle Bachmann's latest outrage focuses on an old nemesis: ACORN. Not only are there new charges in two states related to fraudulent voter registration efforts by ACORN and its employees during the 2008 presidential election, she said, it now appears the group could tap into billions of dollars of federal money in the economic stimulus and the Obama administration's proposed 2010 budget. In a May 6 news release, Bachmann sounded the alarm: "At least $53 million in federal funds have gone to ACORN activists since 1994, and the controversial group could get up to $8.5 billion more tax dollars despite being under investigation for voter registration fraud in a dozen states. The economic stimulus bill enacted in February contains $3 billion that the nonprofit activist group known more formally as the Association for Community Organizations for Reform Now could receive, and 2010 federal budget contains another $5.5 billion that could also find its way into the group's coffers." She has since thrown these numbers out several times in interviews, including ones with Lou Dobbs on CNN and Glenn Beck on Fox. In January, we addressed a piece of this when we fact-checked a claim from House Republican Leader John Boehner, who warned the economic stimulus package "could open billions of taxpayer dollars to left-wing groups like the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN)." Boehner was referring to $2.2 billion in the stimulus package for "neighborhood stabilization," essentially money doled out to groups to buy up abandoned and foreclosed homes, to rehabilitate them and then sell or rent them out. ACORN said it had no plans to apply for the funding, and if it did, the money would have to be used to buy and fix abandoned houses, not for voter registration efforts. We ruled that claim Barely True . This latest claim from Bachmann follows the same tortured logic on an even grander scale. A spokesman from Bachmann's office said the congresswoman got her data from a May 6, 2009, Washington Examiner commentary written by Kevin Mooney, who got the $8.5 billion figure from Matthew Vadum, a senior analyst and editor with Capital Research Center, a conservative think tank. Let's first look at how they arrived at that number. It includes, of course, the same $2.2 billion that Boehner cited from the stimulus package. Vadum also adds $1 billion in the stimulus for Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds. ACORN could potentially tap into that, he said. The remaining $5.5 billion comes from the Obama administration's proposed 2010 budget, specifically the budget for Housing and Urban Development. The budget plan includes $1 billion for an Affordable Housing Trust Fund, plus $4.5 billion more for CDBGs. CDBGs have been around since 1974. Obama is seeking to increase the CDBG budget from about $3.6 billion in 2009 to $4.2 billion next year. And then there's the additional $1 billion for CDBGs in the stimulus. But the point is, this isn't some new pot of money that hasn't been available in years past. To the extent ACORN has been eligible for CDBG money for decades, it is available to ACORN now. But the fact is, ACORN isn't eligible for CDBG funding. At least not for the controversial voter registration efforts that Republican leaders claim are a willful effort to forward the group's liberal agenda. ACORN has a complex corporate structure. It's actually a network of affiliates. The ACORN that Republicans love to hate gets involved in political activity like voter registration. But there are other entities, like the sister company, ACORN Housing Corporation, a nonprofit that provides free housing counseling to low and moderate income homebuyers. Some of the ACORN Housing affiliates have also dabbled in affordable housing projects and have received federal funding. But ACORN Housing doesn't get involved in voter registration activities. CDBG money is given to local governments and states to use as they see fit for community development projects. But there are strings attached. CDBG rules list eligible uses of the money, including such things as building sidewalks, sewers and affordable housing, mostly. Specifically ineligible: "political activities." In other words, ACORN can't use the money for voter registration. According to the Washington Examiner 's report, ACORN and its affiliates have received $53 million from the federal government since 1994. Most of that federal money went to the ACORN Housing Corporation, which by law could not be used for voter registration. We checked, and there is no money in the stimulus package or the budget for voter registration programs. So if ACORN Housing was to apply for and receive CDBG money, it would be for a very specific project. And legally, it could not be transferred to other ACORN affiliates to perform political activities like voter registration. But some ACORN opponents allege that's exactly what would happen. "ACORN is constantly shifting funding," Vadum said. If ACORN Housing were to get federal funding, "we don't know where it would go. The problem is that ACORN transfers vast sums of money around in its network all the time. We don't know whether the money would be spent on voter registration or other activities." According to a July 2002 report from the Employment Policies Institute called "Rotten ACORN, America's Bad Seed," tax forms show that since 1997, the ACORN Housing Corporation has paid more than $5 million in fees or grants to other ACORN entities. The report does not claim, however, that federal tax dollars were shifted into ACORN voter registration efforts. Asked what funds ACORN Housing has transferred to other ACORN affiliates, Vadum said ACORN Housing has paid over $1.5 million to Citizens Consulting Inc., which he describes as "the shadowy part of the ACORN network where money seems to disappear into." That's absurd, said ACORN executive director Steven Kest. Citizens Consulting Inc. is the accounting arm of the ACORN organization. CCI handles bookkeeping, payroll accounting and other financial management services for ACORN and its many affiliates. And ACORN Housing doesn't even use CCI anymore, as it now does its accounting in-house, Kest said. Bottom line, we don't see any evidence that ACORN Housing has transferred money to ACORN for voter registration, so we think it's incorrect for Bachmann to link federal money that ACORN Housing might receive with the more controversial voter registration activities performed by sister organization ACORN. Even more ridiculous is the suggestion that ACORN or any of its affiliates might actually get $8.5 billion in federal tax dollars. Vadum said his report has been misrepresented by many on that point. "The key word here is eligible," Vadum said. "Eligible is a pretty expansive word. I made it clear they are not going to get that full amount." Yes, he made that point in the Washington Examiner. But when Bachmann says ACORN could get that amount, it assumes the group would get every single dime in the stimulus for fixing up abandoned homes. And remember, they said they don't even have plans to apply for any of it. "We think it's a great program," Kest said. "But that's not money we are applying for." And they'd also need to get every single dollar allocated through the CDBG program. That's beyond preposterous. Those grants are allocated to thousands of organizations around the country to perform very specific community development projects. "These are competitive grants for very specific projects," Kest said."The money can only be used for the project you bid for. It can't go to voter registration. If you've ever had any experience with grant funding from the federal government, they do a good job of making sure the money is used for the purposes it was intended. You can't use the money for any other reason. You can't transfer the money to other vehicles for other purposes." Charges of voter registration fraud by members of ACORN during the 2008 elections are a serious matter. Investigators allege ACORN employees tried to fraudulently register thousands of ineligible voters. Among them, one Mickey Mouse. But Bachmann's statement is irresponsibly misleading on several levels. She says the group under indictment for voter registration fraud could tap into billions of federal dollars. In fact, none of the federal money can be used for voter registration activities. An affiliate like ACORN Housing could conceivably apply for a grant to build an affordable housing project, or to buy, fix and sell abandoned homes, but that's exactly what the money would have to be used for. Suggestions that one of the affiliates might funnel money to ACORN for political activity is, so far, unsubstantiated conjecture. And then there's the matter of trying to make a splash by throwing out the massive $8.5 billion number, suggesting ACORN "could get" it, as in all of it. That's absurd. We rule Bachmann's statement False.	None	Michele Bachmann	None	None	None	2009-05-21T18:14:21	2009-05-06	['None']
pomt-09264	Alaska's Prince William Sound "is pristine now."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/30/rush-limbaugh/rush-limbaugh-says-alaskas-prince-william-sound-no/	With 200,000 gallons of oil a day spewing from an exploded oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico, forming a slick the size of West Virginia and threatening the coastline of Louisiana, radio pundit Rush Limbaugh said there's no need to panic, that "the ocean will take care of this on its own if it was left alone and was left out there. It's natural." And to prove his point, Limbaugh pointed to the restoration of Alaska's Prince William Sound, which was devastated by an oil spill from the Exxon Valdez 21 years ago. "They were wiping off the rocks with Dawn dishwater detergent and paper towels and so forth," Limbaugh said on his April 29, 2010, radio show. "The place is pristine now." Government officials involved in the cleanup say the conditions are long way from being pristine, which is defined as "completely free from dirt or contamination." Despite the beautiful scenery and wildlife in full view in Prince William Sound, a report from the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council released last year on the 20th anniversary of the spill stated, "one of the most stunning revelations of Trustee Council-funded monitoring over the last 10 years is that Exxon Valdez oil persists in the environment and in places, is nearly as toxic as it was the first few weeks after the spill." The Trustee Council, formed by the Alaska government to oversee the restoration of the injured ecosystem, concluded the oil is decreasing at a rate of 0 to 4 percent a year, and "at this rate, the remaining oil will take decades and possibly centuries to disappear entirely." We asked Craig Tillery, deputy attorney general for the state of Alaska, about Limbaugh's comment. Tillery, a who has served as counsel to the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council, said it depends on how you define pristine. "The vast majority of oil that landed in Alaska is gone," he said. But the government dug hundreds of test holes and found pockets of "still fresh-looking oil that is still toxic to the marine environment." In all, they estimated 23,000 gallons (of the 11 million gallons spilled by the Exxon Valdez) remains in isolated pockets of some beaches. "It's buried, you wouldn't see it," said Tillery. "It looks pristine, but it's not pristine if your definition is that there's no oil left." And that oil is still getting into the environment, he said. Sea ducks and sea otters are still exhibiting signs of exposure to oil, he said. And animals such as sea otters, which dig for clams, have released some of the oil trapped under the ground. Most of the wildlife has recovered from the spill, Tillery said, but you also need to consider what you don't see. "You don't see as many killer whales as you did before the spill," he said. "You don't see herrings in the numbers you did before the spill. On the surface, you'd probably say this looks pretty pristine. Underlying that, though, there is still evidence of the spill." "There are beaches where you can turn a shovel and still find oil," said Stan Jones, director of external affairs for the Prince William Sound Regional Citizens Advisory Council. Prince William sound has "mostly recovered visually," Jones said, but to call it pristine is an "overstatement." Dr. Jeffrey Short, who was the leading chemist for the governments of Alaska and the United States following the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, led a series of studies on the unexpected persistence of the oil. In a Q & A with the environmental group Oceana, with whom he is now employed, Short stated, "We found that it (oil) lasted a lot longer than we thought in some locations and it was much better preserved than we thought it would be. In some places the oil hadn't degraded much beyond the first couple months after it had spilled." We asked Short about Limbaugh's comment and he said that while it's fair to say most of Prince William Sound has recovered from the impact of the Exxon Valdez, "there are some places where the oil continues to linger." In fact, the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council has a link on its website to its "Report on Recent Lingering Oil Studies." "At the time of the spill, most scientists believed that, within a few years, the process of weathering would either break down and decompose the oil, or would cause it to turn into a form of asphalt that would have little potential to release toxic components into the environment," the report states. "Contrary to these expectations, oil persists at some sites in Prince William Sound and the Gulf of Alaska in a relatively unweathered and potentially toxic condition." "Organisms that use the intertidal were severely affected by the spill and continued to show adverse effects from exposure to oil for many years after the spill. These effects manifested themselves in reduced survival rates and diminished populations. In recent years, however, there is evidence of improvement. The extent of oil exposure appears to be diminishing in most species, and there is evidence that the populations of some species are beginning to increase." That sounds encouraging. But it doesn't change the fact that, despite outward appearance, 21 years after the Exxon Valdez spill, Prince William Sound is not pristine. You may not be able to see it, but scientists and anyone willing to turn over rocks with a shovel attest to the fact that thousands of gallons of oil remain buried in some beaches, and the oil continues to adversely affect the environment. We rule Limbaugh's statement False.	None	Rush Limbaugh	None	None	None	2010-04-30T18:21:47	2010-04-29	['Prince_William_Sound', 'Alaska']
pomt-00481	"Wisconsin's still one of the highest-taxed states in the country."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/aug/10/josh-pade/democratic-candidate-wisconsin-governor-miscalcula/	Josh Pade was a latecomer to the crowded Democratic governor’s race. The Kenosha lawyer has not been a major factor in the polls, or the fundraising tallies. But we were struck by a claim Pade made June 1, 2018, in an interview on WisconsinEye, since it went right to the tax cuts Republican Gov. Scott Walker touts as a major achievement. When asked what he would do about the state’s struggling middle class, Pade referenced his tax background and said as governor he wants to put together a bipartisan group to reform the state’s tax code. He also said this: "Scott Walker touts his tax cuts. Unfortunately Wisconsin’s still one of the highest-taxed states in the country." Is he right about Wisconsin’s tax status? The evidence When we asked Pade’s campaign to provide backup for the statement, spokeswoman Kate Cooney pointed us to a study by Wallethub, a personal finance website, that ranked Wisconsin as 46th in effective tax rate (Number 1 being the lowest). "We do acknowledge that other measurements of taxation have shown a lowered trend over time beginning before Governor Walker took office, but those studies are not as comprehensive in their data sets," said Cooney. "We have also pointed out the tax burden as a percentage of income in Wisconsin is often lower on the most wealthiest income brackets than those with lower income." A spokesman for Walker’s campaign declined to offer any evidence on the issue, so we checked with a variety of experts and other rankings. Since Pade’s statement referred to taxes in general, we’ll start with what experts said about the overall tax burden. Tamarine Cornelius, a research analyst at the Wisconsin Budget Project: She said the state ranks somewhere in the middle when looking at state and local taxes -- 20th when measured on a per-state resident basis in 2015 and 21st when measured as a share of personal income. "Measured either way, state and local taxes in Wisconsin are actually below the national average," she said, noting that when fees are included it drops Wisconsin’s rank even further. "In Wisconsin, residents pay lower fees than residents in many other states," she said. Tax Foundation: A 2018 report from the Tax Foundation, an independent tax policy nonprofit, also shows Wisconsin in the middle of the pack with a rank of 18 for state tax collections per capita for 2016. Richard Auxier, a research associate with the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute: "It looks like it’s a stretch to say Wisconsin is one of the highest taxed states in the country," he said. He mentioned the state’s "somewhat progressive" income tax rates, noting the top rate isn’t that high compared to other states; the existence of an Earned Income Tax Credit, though it isn’t as large as some others; and an average, if not low, sales tax rate compared to other states. So, all three put Wisconsin in the middle of the pack, not "one of the highest." Why does the Wallethub study differ? Cornelius said she had concerns with how Wallethub did its analysis. She noted thestate Legislative Fiscal Bureau had determined the amount of property taxes paid on a median-valued house in Wisconsin to be $2,830. Cornelius said the Wallethub study "overestimated property taxes on a median-valued house by 27%." Specific taxes What about Wisconsin’s rank for specific taxes? On property taxes, we contacted senior research analyst Adam Langley from the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, a nonprofit focused on economic, social and environmental components of land. He pointed us to a ranking of states by property tax collection as a percentage of personal income from the Tax Policy Center’s State and Local Data Query Systembased on a survey of state and local governments. Wisconsin ranked 12th at 3.7 percent. He also pointed to an analysis his group did using U.S. Census Bureau data. That analysis examined the median property tax bill as a percentage of the median household income for homeowners for 2015. Wisconsin ranked eighth at 4.6 percent. "Property taxes are definitely higher in most New England states, New Jersey and Illinois than they are in Wisconsin," Langley said, "Depending on the specific measure of property taxes used for the comparison, there are several more states that also have higher property taxes than Wisconsin." On income taxes, Auxier called Wisconsin’s income taxes "somewhat progressive" and referenced the state Department of Revenue’s tax rates and an Urban Institute summary of U.S. Census Bureau data. Auxier said Wisconsin’s four brackets, with a top rate on income above $329,810 for married filers, are relatively progressive because half the states that have an income tax have one flat rate or a threshold for their top rate on income below $40,000, which is "essentially flat." Auxier said the most important thing to keep in mind when thinking about state taxes is different people pay different taxes. This is why statements saying one state is the highest-taxed are not that simple. He referenced an Urban Institute study he co-authored that estimated what each state’s revenue would look like with a tax system based on national average tax rates. Results showed "Wisconsin’s actual taxes raise about as much revenue as it would with the average system," Auxier said. Our rating Pade said "Wisconsin's still one of the highest-taxed states in the country." The study his campaign provided as evidence was from an organization that does not specialize in tax analysis and experts we spoke with were skeptical of how the study was done. In any case, the statement was too broad to be accurate. Specific taxes may rank higher than others, and the rankings might vary for different income groups. But the claim was about taxes in general. And, in general, the state is now more middle of the pack. We rate his statement Mostly False.

pomt-04457	Says Romney wants to "take away early childhood education, slash K-12 funding, and cut college aid … to pay for a $250,000 tax break for multi-millionaires."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/10/priorities-usa-action/super-pac-says-romney-takes-education-gives-millio/	A new super PAC ad accuses Mitt Romney of pushing deep cuts in education to finance a tax cut for the wealthy. The ad from Priorities USA Action, which supports President Barack Obama, shows images of children playing, along with these words: "Take away his toys, and he’ll play with a stick. Take away their bikes, and they’ll still find a way to get where they’re going. But if you take away early childhood education, slash K-12 funding and cut college aid for middle class families, they won’t go far. Yet that’s exactly what Mitt Romney wants to do to pay for a $250,000 tax break for multi-millionaires." The kicker: "If Mitt Romney wins, the middle class loses." A spokesman for Priorities USA told us that the claims about education refer to the budget proposed by Romney’s running mate, Paul Ryan. We’ll check whether the ad is accurate about the budget’s impact on education and if those changes are things Romney "wants to do" in order to fund a tax cut. The Ryan budget Ryan, a congressman from Wisconsin, first presented his budget in 2011. Versions of it have passed the House each of the last two years, but it has never passed the Democratic-controlled Senate. The 2013 proposal cuts $5.3 trillion from the federal ledger over the next decade by enacting major changes in entitlement programs and making steep reductions in discretionary domestic spending. It’s important to keep in mind that Ryan’s plan doesn’t say which programs would be cut or by how much, nor does it dictate that programs be cut across the board. On early childhood education: Nowhere in the Ryan budget is there a line item cutting Head Start funding, or any other program. But because the budget reduces federal spending so drastically -- from its current level of 12.5 percent of GDP down to 5.75 percent by 2030 -- experts say deep program cuts will be necessary. The numbers alone have early education advocates nervous. One analysis by the National Education Association determined that Ryan’s proposed 2013 budget could eliminate spots in Head Start programs for about 191,000 children in 2014, and 2 million over the next decade. Head Start uses federal funds to provide education, nutrition and parent-involvement services to help low-income kids be school ready by age 5. Romney’s campaign website does not mention early education. We would note that during his time as governor of Massachusetts, Romney vetoed a bill that had passed the legislature authorizing universal prekindergarten in the state. On K-12 funding: the ad points to a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank. The study notes that a cut of 22 percent in 2014 of non-discretionary spending, plus more in subsequent years, "would force states and localities to reduce the quality and reach of their basic public systems — their schools, clean water facilities, and law enforcement activities, for example — or raise new revenue or cut other programs to continue meeting these needs. Either way, the result would be a huge cost shift from the federal government to states and localities." Again, as this study points out, these cuts are speculative. It would be state and local governments deciding on the cuts, not the federal government. On college aid for the middle class: This charge stems from a study by the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Brookings Institution and Urban Institute, attempting to calculate the effects of Romney’s tax proposal. The proposal lacks detail but sets some broad outlines, including allowing the American Opportunity tax credit for higher education, which was part of the 2009 stimulus bill, to expire. According to the study, Romney’s economic advisers say that the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) would revert back to the Helping Outstanding Pupils Educationally (HOPE) tax credit, which also provides aid to college students but is less generous and covers fewer Americans than the AOTC. In addition, Romney and Ryan have been criticized for what could happen to federal Pell Grants in Ryan’s budget. The program provides the largest source of grant funding for needy college students, with more than 9.7 million students expected to get grants worth up to $5,635 per student in 2013, according to the Education Department. Republicans say in documents accompanying the budget that they favor reining in the Pell program, by keeping the maximum grant award in 2013 at this year's level of $5,550, and other means. The House Budget Committee says it would stay at $5,550 for the full 10 years of the budget, though that’s not spelled out in the budget resolution itself. In fact, the budget resolution says nothing at all about Pell grants. Romney’s stance So where does Romney stand on the Ryan budget? That answer is something of a moving target. In March 2012, Romney said in Chicago, "I’m very supportive of the Ryan budget plan. The following week, while campaigning in Wisconsin, he added, "I think it’d be marvelous if the Senate were to pick up Paul Ryan’s budget and adopt it and pass it along to the President." More recently, since Ryan joined the ticket, Romney has said the two agree broadly. "I’m sure there are places that my budget is different than his, but we’re on the same page," he said in August. The campaign has also emphasized the Romney will put together his own plan. But on his website, Romney makes this promise about "stopping the bleeding" of federal spending: "Pass the House Republican Budget proposal, rolling back President Obama’s government expansion by capping non-security discretionary spending below 2008 levels." Regarding the specific charges in the ad, the Romney campaign points to remarks he has made on the trail. On early childhood education and K-12 funding: "I'm not going to cut education funding. I don't have any plan to cut education funding and grants that go to people going to college. I'm planning on continuing to grow, so I'm not planning on making changes there," Romney said in his Oct. 3 debate with Obama. On college aid: "We’re going to continue a Pell Grant program. … I think the Republican budget called for a Pell Grants being capped out at their current high level. My inclination would be to have them go with the rate of inflation," he said at a Univision Forum in Miami on Sept. 19. About those multi-millionaires Finally, the Priorities USA ad says Romney will make all these education cuts "to pay for a $250,000 tax break for multi-millionaires." The dollar figure also comes from the Tax Policy Center study. The authors found that under Romney’s proposal, people with $1 million or more in annual cash income will receive an average tax cut of $250,535. Those in the millionaire category will receive an 11.8 percent increase in after-tax income, easily the highest of any income group. Collectively, the tax savings for millionaires would amount to nearly one-third of all the tax benefits that result from Romney’s plan. But is the accounting really that simple? There’s not a direct link between spending cuts and tax rates for the wealthy, said Maya MacGuineas, president of the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. They’re separate policy areas, and legislation affecting each area would typically be handled separately. Nevertheless, choices about spending and taxes are not entirely unrelated, given the imbalance in the federal budget in recent years and the significant debt that is building up, MacGuineas said. We asked her in general about the various Democratic claims saying that specific spending cuts "pay for" tax breaks for the wealthy. "It’s a huge fight over priorities and semantics," she said. "But it’s difficult to say that one is linked to the other." Our ruling Priorities USA Action said Romney wants to pay for a tax cut for multimillionaires by taking away early childhood education, slashing K-12 funding, and cutting college aid for middle class families. Each charge is an interpretation of how the House budget, proposed by Ryan and somewhat embraced by Romney, could impact education at all levels. The warnings are plausible given the scale of spending cuts called for in Ryan’s budget, but they’re speculative -- these cuts aren’t specified in the Ryan budget, and Romney has said his policies would be different. Finally, spending cuts and tax breaks aren’t a one-to-one comparison, though they do reflect priorities. The ad’s claim contains an element of truth but takes liberties as it tries to fill in the blanks in Romney's plan. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-12150	"Bill Clinton gave North Korea $5 billion and two nuclear reactors in 1994, essentially giving them nukes."	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/aug/09/viral-image/viral-image-wrongly-blames-bill-clinton-giving-nor/	A viral meme spreading through Twitter blames former President Bill Clinton for not just allowing North Korea to develop nuclear weapons, but fostering their program more than two decades ago. "Bill Clinton gave North Korea $5 billion and two nuclear reactors in 1994, essentially giving them nukes," read the meme we first noticed on Aug. 9, 2017. It included an image that showed Clinton seated next to late North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. It’s worth noting that the photograph is actually from Aug. 4, 2009, when Clinton traveled to Pyongyang to negotiate the release of two American journalists. Kim Jong Il died two years later. HELP KEEP POLITIFACT GOING! MAKE A CONTRIBUTION TO SUPPORT INDEPENDENT FACT-CHECKING The meme popped up after revelations that Kim Jong Un’s regime had potentially developed miniaturized nuclear devices capable of fitting inside intercontinental ballistic missiles. The center of this claim — that Clinton negotiated a deal with North Korea that included two reactors — is based on a real agreement. But there are significant problems with the assertion that Clinton paid the country $5 billion, "essentially giving them nukes." The Agreed Framework While president, Clinton did broker a deal with North Korea, amid revelations that the country was building a full-scale processing facility to produce plutonium. North Korea had kicked international inspectors out of the country in 1993, announcing its intention to pull out of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, an international agreement North Korea had joined in 1985. By then, the North Koreans had separated enough plutonium from spent fuel from a reactor it had built while Clinton was governor of Arkansas to create a couple of nuclear weapons, according to Joshua Pollack, a senior research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. In October 1994, Clinton arranged a deal with incoming leader Kim Jong Il, whose father Kim Il Sung had died in July. North Korea would have to take its current reactor offline and stop construction of two other reactors they said were for electricity. In exchange, the United States would help the country build two so-called light-water nuclear reactors to produce power for the country. The light-water reactors would make it harder for North Korea to produce weapons-grade material. Those reactors were estimated to cost about $4 billion, and would be financed by South Korea, Japan, and possibly Germany, Russia and the United States, the Washington Post reported. In addition, the United States would help provide heavy fuel oil to North Korea, which would have to halt plans to produce nuclear weapons and submit to international inspections. It would have to surrender spent nuclear fuel once the new reactors were built. The deal, which did not require congressional approval, was referred to as the Agreed Framework. Clinton hailed it as a path to easing sanctions and normalizing diplomatic relations. "This agreement will help achieve a longstanding and vital American objective — an end to the threat of nuclear proliferation on the Korean Peninsula," Clinton said of the deal. End of the deal Spoiler: The Agreed Framework failed. North Korea accelerated its efforts to enrich uranium, which wasn’t a direct violation of the framework, and accused the United States of reneging on fuel oil promises. That certainly irked the George W. Bush administration, which cut off fuel oil shipments in 2002. North Korea withdrew from the agreement, ending its obligation to abide by the deal’s terms. By 2006, North Korea claimed it had successfully tested a nuclear device. To say that Clinton’s deal was the culprit is wrong, however. Richard Nephew, a senior research scholar at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, said that while the Agreed Framework was flawed, it impeded North Korea’s ambitions. The meme misrepresented much about the deal. "This is a problem that is years in the making, owned by bipartisan administrations, and — for a time, anyway — delayed by President Clinton rather than him giving North Korea nuclear weapons," Nephew said. Importantly, Clinton didn’t give North Korea two reactors, because the construction was never completed. You can even look up the unfinished sites online. And the $5 billion figure the viral image cited wasn’t cash, but likely included the construction costs of the reactors (which were never completed) and energy aid. The Congressional Research Service noted in a 2014 report that the United States provided more than $400 million in heavy fuel oil to North Korea between 1995 and 2003. The consortium created to oversee the reactors’ construction, the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization, still exists on paper. It officially ended the light-water reactor project, but is still working "to settle financial and legal obligations stemming from the termination." "All the North Koreans got out of it in the end is that they stole the construction equipment" for the reactors, Pollack said. "They also learned a few things about building that type of reactor. They’ve tried to make a small initial one themselves, but it appears to have been stalled for years now." In the meantime, Pollack added, the North Koreans have created enough plutonium and enriched enough uranium to create as many as 60 nuclear bombs. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling An image circulating on the Internet claims "Bill Clinton gave North Korea $5 billion and two nuclear reactors in 1994, essentially giving them nukes." Clinton did negotiate a deal in 1994 to provide two nuclear reactors and provide heavy fuel oil to North Korea in exchange for the country giving up its nuclear weapons program. That's about where the truth of this image stops. The energy aid costs didn’t approach anywhere near $5 billion, and the reactors were never built. North Korea had continued to enrich uranium on its own, leading the Bush administration to end the deal. The agreement, while a failure, didn’t give North Korea nuclear weapons. Experts said the agreement actually slowed North Korea down. We rate this statement False.

pomt-05576	"I think it’s seven or eight of the California system of universities don’t even teach an American history course. It’s not even available to be taught."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/apr/03/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-american-history-not-available-/	Rick Santorum might want to read more closely next time. On the stump in Wisconsin on April 2, 2012, the Republican presidential candidate filled in his audience on something he was "just reading … last night." "I think it’s seven or eight of the California system of universities don’t even teach an American history course. It’s not even available to be taught," he said. "Just to tell you how bad it's gotten in this country, where we're trying to disconnect the American people from the roots of who we are, so they have an understanding of what America should be." Soon the progressive news site Think Progress posted a video clip, along with some skepticism, triggering links around the Web. Readers asked us: Was Santorum right? Do that many state universities in California fail to offer American history courses? ‘The California system of universities’ California has a two-tiered university system, with 23 campuses in the California State University system and 10 University of California campuses. All 23 CSU campuses offer courses on U.S. History, the Constitution and American ideals, said Erik Fallis, media relations manager for the California State University — indeed, almost every student needs such a class (or two) to graduate. The story is slightly different at the University of California, which also has an American history and institutions requirement. The graduation requirement can be satisfied with a high school class, except at UC Santa Barbara, which requires a college-level course. Does that mean the campuses don’t offer American history courses? Not at all. Of the nine University of California campuses that offer humanities classes — the San Francisco campus focuses exclusively on health sciences — all nine offer American history. Do those classes get to "the roots of who we are," as Santorum said? Well, among the offerings at UC Davis is "The American Revolution, 1763-1790." UC Riverside teaches upper-division courses on "Revolutionary America" and "The Early Republic: The United States, 1789-1848." UC Santa Cruz includes a course on the "U.S. Revolution: 1740-1815." UC Berkeley addresses, "The United States from Settlement to Civil War." UCLA has "History of the U.S. and Its Colonial Origins: 19th Century" and "Constitutional History of U.S.: Origins and Development of Constitutionalism in U.S." Bottom line, of 33 state universities in California, just one, a health sciences campus, doesn’t teach American history — and nearly all graduates have to complete a related course to graduate, whether in high school or college. What was Santorum talking about? Santorum’s reading We contacted Santorum’s campaign to ask for support for his claim but didn’t hear back. So we tried tracing his reading material ourselves. Eric Dolan, an editor for progressive news site Raw Story, noted that Santorum appeared to be making a reference to a recent opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal, "How California's Colleges Indoctrinate Students." The March 30, 2012, column by Hoover Institution fellow Peter Berkowitz argues that higher education is politicized and declining in quality as its curriculum changes. He notes: "None of the nine general campuses in the UC system requires students to study the history and institutions of the United States. None requires students to study Western civilization, and on seven of the nine UC campuses, including Berkeley, a survey course in Western civilization is not even offered." Berkowitz is right that most University of California campuses don’t require a college-level course, with the exception of Santa Barbara — though they do require at least a high-school level class. We didn’t check on class offerings in Western civilization, since that’s not what Santorum said. Berkowitz also cites a recent report, called "A Crisis of Competence," from the National Association of Scholars, where he’s on the board of directors. It mentions that "the vast majority of our colleges have made a course on the broad themes of U.S. history or government optional." Then it points out a laudable exception: The California State University system. "All but three of the more than twenty campuses of the CSU system require American History and Institutions as an essential part of their curricula. But the situation in UC is very different: not a single UC campus has such a requirement. … To be sure, UC requires a year of U.S. history in high school for undergraduate admissions, but University of California level instruction ought to be on a completely different level – why otherwise would students need to go on to a university at all if high school coursework is equivalent?" Santorum went much further than either Berkowitz or the National Association of Scholars report, declaring that at seven or eight universities in the California system, they "don’t even teach an American history course." There’s simply no support for that claim. Our ruling Rick Santorum said, "I think it’s seven or eight of the California system of universities don’t even teach an American history course. It’s not even available to be taught." While he appeared to be referencing a recent Wall Street Journal opinion piece, he bungled the details — and badly. Far from "not available," American history courses are offered at all but one of 33 state universities in California. We rate his statement False.

pomt-08076	The Milwaukee business community "did not speak about the facts" -- and in support of train manufacturer Talgo -- as the Milwaukee-Madison rail link was being killed.	true	/wisconsin/statements/2010/dec/20/talgo-inc/talgo-says-milwaukee-business-community-did-not-sp/	Nearly two years ago, Wisconsin Gov. Jim Doyle made a quiet trip to Spain to look into high speed rail. During that jaunt -- announced the day he departed -- Doyle visited train maker Talgo Inc. Talgo had been seeking business in Wisconsin, and Doyle’s visit was another step in the courting dance between the Spanish firm and state and local officials, a relationship that turned into a sour one in December 2010. Not long after Doyle’s visit, Talgo won a $43.1 million no-bid contract to build two trains for Amtrak service between Milwaukee and Chicago. Local officials had hoped Talgo would share work with local firm Super Steel, but Talgo rejected that idea. Milwaukee later offered Talgo incentives to open its own factory at a portion of the old Tower Automotive site on the city’s north side. Talgo also received an option for two more trains as part of $810 million in federal funds for a planned high-speed route from Milwaukee to Madison. The firm was in the process of hiring 125 people to build the trains when the project hit the wall. Virtually all of that federal money was withdrawn Dec. 9 and sent to other states after Governor-elect Scott Walker held fast to his opposition to the Milwaukee-Madison link. And the finger-pointing began. Well, make that, continued. Talgo issued a statement from Nora Friend, the company’s vice president for public affairs and business development, that included this comment directed at the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce: "Talgo is also disappointed that the business community did not speak about the facts on this project." She added: "Talgo was encouraged by the business community to move to Wisconsin, and they were silent about the very same facts that made this project the only one in the nation that qualified to be fully funded by the federal government." So, did the influential MMAC really sit idle while a new employer was, in essence, sent packing? Even after, in late November, Talgo pleaded publicly pleaded that it speak out on behalf of the train project? We talked with MMAC president Tim Sheehy, one of the most plugged in business and political figures in the state. The high speed train situation, he said, was one of the most contentious matters he has grappled with in the 17 years he’s led the group. Sheehy took the unusual step of surveying his membership about high speed rail and posted the results online. "It was huge and it was hot," he said of the response. About 40 percent of MMAC members responded, and about 200 included comments with their vote. The key question: "Do you support creation of a high speed rail line between Milwaukee and Madison as part of a proposed Midwest rail network connecting Chicago to the Twin Cities?" The answer was a 50-50 split: 214 members for and the same number against. Said Sheehy: "When you have a membership split so dramatically and so evenly on an issue you don’t have anything to lobby for." The MMAC previously had supported the Milwaukee-Madison connection, along with the new trains and other upgrades for the service to Chicago. Sheehy said he went "line by line" through the application for the $810 million to tease out items that his members would agree upon. "We wanted to see if there was a way to keep half of the money," for existing rail service, he said, adding: "Why throw out the baby with the bathwater?" Sheehy’s efforts to find middle ground failed, in part because the positions of Walker and the federal Department of Transportation were so rigid. Five weeks after the Nov. 2 election, the feds said they would yank the money from Wisconsin. One day later Talgo said it would pull out the manufacturing jobs after the work was done. Some 60 maintenance jobs will remain. "Quite frankly, the door closed pretty fast here," Sheehy said. Sheehy included this statement with the survey results, which were posted after the state lost the train money: "We are disappointed the administration took an ‘all or nothing’ approach to these funds. While our survey reflected clear disagreement on the passenger rail spur to Madison, there was considerable support for individual components of the proposal that would have upgraded existing passenger and freight rail capacity." Friend said Talgo felt the MMAC survey "did not do justice or reflect benefits of rail development." She said Talgo thought the MMAC "would be a neutral educational resource and could speak factually about pros and cons of different infrastructure projects and help disseminate accurate information for people who naturally don't appreciate rail because they are not privileged to know that industry or its benefits."

pomt-07591	On his support for sharply limiting collective bargaining by public employees.	half flip	/wisconsin/statements/2011/mar/25/jeff-stone/collective-bargaining-stones-votes-were-consistent/	State Rep. Jeff Stone’s path to keeping the Milwaukee County executive’s job in Republican hands became a bumpy one when massive protests greeted Gov. Scott Walker’s plan to sharply curtail collective bargaining rights for public employees. Stone supported Walker’s move in two Assembly votes, but his comments in between those votes drew criticism from opponent Chris Abele, who said Stone, R-Greendale, was trying to have it both ways. That means it’s time to roll out the Flip-O-Meter, which measures whether politicians have changed their position on key issues. Here’s our standard disclaimer: We’re not evaluating whether it was good or bad policy -- or politics -- to shift, just to what degree a shift occurred. Let’s start back in February. At a Feb. 11, 2011, news conference in Madison, Stone joined a small group who stood with Walker as the governor unveiled his budget-repair bill. The plan included the collective bargaining changes imposed new pension and health care contributions on workers. On Feb. 22, 2011, amid the Capitol protests, Stone argued against changes in Walker’s budget-repair bill, which he termed a difficult but reasonable step to solving deficits of $130 million in the budget year that ends June 30, 2011, and more than $3 billion for the next two years. "I don't think we can solve this problem by going part way with this bill," he said in lengthy remarks during the Assembly floor debate. He backed his words with his votes: Stone voted against dozens of Democratic amendments during the long debate on the bill, including ones that would have preserved the current collective bargaining setup. So, no change in position there. Ten days later, wearing his other hat as a candidate to succeed Walker as Milwaukee County executive, Stone took a different tack. He told a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reporter he would have taken a different approach to the budget than limiting collective bargaining and signaled he would have supported the budget bill without the provisions. "I understand it's a major issue to the unions," Stone said in the story. "It's not necessarily the way I would have drafted this budget-repair bill. I would have approached it in different ways." "Those weren’t elements that had to be included for me to support this bill," Stone said, according to the reporter’s notes. "I didn’t think they were necessary for me to make the (pension and health) changes in Milwaukee County." Stone, the Journal Sentinel story reported, emphasized that he felt the other provisions in the measure made the repair bill worth supporting. So Stone had voted against amendments that would have kept the bargaining rights intact -- but said soon after that he would have been willing to support a version that kept the bargaining rights intact. Was he doing one thing and saying another? It was those remarks that touched off partisan charges of double-speak and flip-flopping. They also drew some skeptical attention from a conservative Walker campaign supporter who backs the governor’s plans regarding unions. WTMJ-AM (620) talk show host Charlie Sykes asked Stone during his March 8, 2011, show to explain his position in light of his remarks to the newspaper. "I’m confused," Sykes told candidate Stone. Stone said he was "confused" about the story but did not suggest it was wrong. He said he was trying to draw a contrast between his views and those of Walker. He repeated his position that there were things he "might have approached differently" on bargaining. But moments later he tacked again, offering an unequivocal defense of Walker’s plan. "I support what’s in the bill," Stone said. "I support what Gov. Walker has proposed. I support the requirements there as far as the votes that are in the bill." On the same day, Stone’s office tried to remove all doubt, quoting Stone in a news release as saying: "My position on collective bargaining for public employees is this; the current practice needs to be ended." The Assembly gave the bill final passage on March 10 -- a scaled-down version that nevertheless kept intact all the collective bargaining restrictions. We turned to Stone to explain his shifting statements. He did not challenge that he told the Journal Sentinel he would have excluded the bargaining limits. He acknowledged that people could read into his remarks that he was against the move. Stone said he erred when he said that he would have written the bill differently. He said he underestimated the size of the state’s budget challenge, saying it became clear when Walker came out with his two-year budget for 2011-’13, which is separate from the short-term budget-repair bill. "I didn’t understand the budget situation," including how deep the cuts would be if the bargaining changes were not made, Stone said. But Walker’s budget was introduced two days before Stone made his remarks to the newspaper. "I never flipped on the bill," Stone said. "I voted for it both times." Stone’s right on that. But he has offered clearly inconsistent statements on his feelings on the most controversial aspect of the bill, appearing to want it both ways and changing rhetorical course several times. On the Flip-O-Meter, here is the definition for a Half Flip: "A partial change of position or inconsistent statements." That’s what fits here.

pomt-04722	Says that when Democrats controlled Congress and the White House, federal spending as a share of the Gross Domestic Product leapt from 18.2 percent in 2001 to 25.2 percent in 2009 -- the largest such increase in any eight-year period since World War II.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2012/aug/31/john-cornyn/john-cornyn-says-when-democrats-controlled-congres/	U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, recently declared an "inconvenient factoid" about Democrats and spending. Cornyn’s Aug. 21, 2012, Facebook post says next that "when Ds controlled Congress and WH: federal spending as a share of GDP leapt from 18.2 percent in 2001 to 25.2 percent in 2009 (this was the largest such increase in ANY 8 year period since WWII)." That is, Cornyn says, federal spending in comparison to the nation’s economic production, or Gross Domestic Product, spiked. Asked how the senator reached his conclusion, his spokesman, Scott Gosnell, pointed us to a chart in a report by the Office of Management and Budget, the budget-policy arm of the executive branch. And according to the chart, federal outlays were equivalent to 18.2 percent of the GDP in 2001 and 25.2 percent of the GDP in 2009, as Cornyn says. Such spending dipped to 24.1 percent of the GDP in 2010 and 2011, according to the chart, which appears on a White House web page in connection with President Barack Obama’s proposed budget for the 2013 fiscal year. And was the 39 percent increase over that period the greatest since World War II? Seems so. Federal outlays were equal to 9.8 percent of the GDP in 1940. They were 43.6 percent of the GDP in 1943 and 1944, the chart says, or more than quadruple the 1940 ratio.. From 1947 through 1974, by our calculation, the ratio averaged 18 percent. It was 20 percent to nearly 24 percent each year from 1975 through 1997, dropping to 18.5 percent in 1999. In other words, we did not spot any eight-year post-WW II spikes bigger than the one underscored by Cornyn. Then again, we noticed, federal spending as a share of GDP averaged 20 percent over his cited years, not much greater than in previous years. Also, in two years, 2004 and 2007, federal spending compared with the GDP was slightly down from the previous year. Next, we looked into whether Democrats controlled Congress and the White House over the cited years, as Cornyn says. Not exactly. A Democrat, Bill Clinton, was president for about four months at the start of the 2001 fiscal year. But George W. Bush, a Republican, was president from Jan. 20, 2001, until Obama, a Democrat, was inaugurated on Jan. 20, 2009. Obama accounts for a little more than eight months of the cited years. And did Democrats rule Congress over those years? Occasionally, though Republicans were dominant for longer spells. As we noted in an earlier fact check, the GOP controlled the House from 1995 through 2006, while Democrats controlled the House from 2007 through 2010, as detailed on a House web page. According to a Senate web page, Republicans were the upper chamber’s majority party in 2000 through early June 2001 and again from Nov. 12, 2002, through 2006. Democrats have comprised the majority since 2007. So, a Republican was president for all but one of the cited years and Republicans held the House majority for six of the nine years and a Senate majority for about four years and seven months of the nine years -- with Democrats holding the Senate majority for four years and five months. Still, Democrats held House and Senate majorities from 2007 through 2010 -- and Obama was president for 2009 and 2010. Over this more limited time period, the ratio of spending to the GDP escalated from nearly 21 percent to 25.2 percent before dropping to 24.1 percent. We asked Cornyn’s office about the mixed-bag dominance of Democrats in his cited period. Gosnell replied by email that Cornyn "was making the point that out of the 8-point increase in outlays between 2001-2009, the majority of that increase (5.5 points) occurred in just three years – 2007-2009 – the same three years the Democrats controlled both chambers and then the WH in 2009. The point is: the huge jump in outlays occurred with D’s in charge." That’s an interesting focus, yet not what Cornyn wrote on Facebook. The theme of Gosnell’s reply, that the brunt of the spending-to-GDP uptick occurred when Democrats were dominant, was explored in a June 4, 2012, article by our colleagues at FactCheck.org, headlined: "Obama’s Spending: ‘Inferno’ or Not?" That article says the one-year 19 percent spending surge in fiscal 2009 "was mostly due to appropriations and policies that were already in place when Obama took office" in January 2009, the fourth month of the fiscal year. Obama’s spending initiatives, the story says, increased that year’s spending by up to $203 billion, or well under half the year’s overall increase, which was caused in part by bank bailout legislation approved by President Bush. The FactCheck.org article mentions a May 24, 2012, analysis in Forbes by Daniel J. Mitchell, a senior fellow at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute, giving responsibility for even less of the 2009 increase to Obama. Generally, Mitchell concluded that since President Lyndon Johnson’s tenure, George W. Bush shakes out, like Johnson and Richard Nixon, a "relatively profligate" president. We asked Mitchell about Cornyn’s recent statement blaming Democrats for the spending-to-GDP increase. Mitchell replied by email that while most of the key spending increases occurred after Democrats won control of Congress in the 2006 elections, the bumps also had Bush’s approval, "so both parties deserve blame." Finally, the story by FactCheck.org says that the health care overhaul Obama signed into law in 2010 calls for a new spending wave, starting in 2014, to subsidize coverage for millions of Americans who would otherwise lack it -- adding an estimated $110 billion to federal outlays in fiscal 2015, and more in later years. Significantly, too, the story says, government revenue receipts are running well below historical averages. "It is the combination of historically high spending and low revenues that is producing the current string of trillion-dollar annual deficits, and piling up debt," FactCheck.org said. "Those who blame deficits solely on spending ignore the other side of the ledger." Our ruling Cornyn said that when Democrats controlled Congress and the White House, federal spending as a share of the GDP leapt from 18.2 percent in 2001 to 25.2 percent in 2009 -- the largest such increase in any eight-year period since World War II. Those percentages and the claim to a post-war record are correct. However, Democrats were in control of Congress solely in the last few years of the period and held the presidency for only eight of the 108 cited months. All told, Cornyn’s claim has the math right but errs significantly by laying all the blame on Democrats. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-14436	"Almost every poll has shown that Sanders vs. Trump does a lot better than Clinton vs. Trump … and, that’s true nationally."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/08/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-he-consistently-beats-donald-t/	To potential supporters who worry about his viability as a general-election candidate, Bernie Sanders has often pointed to polls showing him doing better against Republican frontrunner Donald Trump than Sanders’ Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. Sanders repeated this point during the Democratic presidential debate in Flint, Mich., on March 6. "I would love to run against Donald Trump, and I’ll tell you why," Sanders said. "For a start, … not all, but almost every poll has shown that Sanders vs. Trump does a lot better than Clinton vs. Trump. … And, that’s true nationally." We decided to take a closer look at the national polling data and to check with polling experts to see whether head-to-head polls at this stage of the campaign are reliable. HELP US RAISE $15,000 TO HIRE AN EXTRA FACT-CHECKER Using the RealClearPolitics.com poll archive, we found seven national surveys since Jan. 1 that tested both Clinton and Sanders against Trump in a general-election contest. Here’s the rundown. For each poll, the candidate who runs stronger against Trump is listed in bold. Poll and date Clinton vs. Trump result Sanders vs. Trump result CNN/ORC, 2/24-2/27 Clinton +6 Sanders +12 Fox News, 2/15-2/17 Clinton +5 Sanders +15 Quinnipiac, 2/10-2/15 Clinton +1 Sanders +6 USA Today/Suffolk, 2/11-2/15 Trump +2 Trump +1 Public Policy Polling, 2/2-2/3 Clinton +7 Sanders +4 Quinnipiac, 2/2, 2/4 Clinton +5 Sanders +10 NBC-Wall St. Journal, 1/9-1/13 Clinton +10 Sanders +15 The chart shows that Sanders has a point. Of the seven polls in 2016 that tested both Democratic candidates, Sanders ran stronger against Trump in six of them. (In one case, the USA Today/Suffolk poll, Trump beat both, but beat Sanders by slightly less.) Case closed? Not quite, say polling experts. Clinton has been scrutinized and attacked as a public figure for a quarter century, but Sanders is a relatively new figure to voters nationally. So while a lot of voters’ minds are already made up about Clinton based on her long history in the public eye, it remains to be seen how open potential voters will be to supporting Sanders once Republicans start airing negative attacks, especially ones that note his identification as a democratic socialist. (We have previously reported that, according to polls, being a socialist is a less attractive quality for voters than being an atheist.) "Very few Americans are making these comparisons yet, so opinion about these choices is likely to be weakly held, particularly for a large number of middle-of-the-road, independent, and disinterested Americans who are not participating in primaries and caucuses," said Steven S. Smith, a Washington University political scientist and a specialist in public opinion. Smith added that early polls do not weed out "likely voters," as polls later in the campaign do. This could matter, given Sanders’ high rates of support among college students and younger voters, who have not yet demonstrated a long track record of voting. "If Sanders draws disproportionately from people who are not likely to vote, which is a reasonable speculation at this point, then his support may be somewhat overstated in some comparisons," Smith said. (He added that the same high level of first-time or irregular voters applies to Trump, but this should be less of a factor for Clinton, whose supporters skew older and more experienced than Sanders’ do.) Karlyn Bowman, a polling analyst with the American Enterprise Institute, agreed that "national polls don’t have a great deal of predictive value this early in the campaign." She pointed to research by Harry Enten, a polling analyst at the website fivethirtyeight.com. Enten found that since 1944, general election polls about a year before Election Day "have only been weakly predictive of the eventual result." He found that polls pitting the eventual Democratic and Republican nominees were, on average, off by more than 10 points from the eventual result. To cite just one example, Enten wrote that "if you trusted the polls in late 1991, you might have thought Bill Clinton was finished in the 1992 presidential election. George H.W. Bush was ahead of Clinton by 21 percentage points at the time; Bush was basking in sky-high approval ratings after the first Gulf War. But as the Gulf War triumph faded and the economy became the focus of the campaign, Clinton would gain in the polls and eventually overtake Bush." Our ruling Sanders said that "almost every poll has shown that Sanders vs. Trump does a lot better than Clinton vs. Trump … and, that’s true nationally." On the numbers, Sanders is right. He runs stronger against Trump than Clinton in six of the seven national head-to-head polls since Jan. 1. However, polling experts say such results should be taken with a grain of salt, since polls taken well before the start of the general-election contest have historically not been very accurate predictors of the November results. The statement is accurate but needs additional context, so we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-01332	"95 percent of job creators say Wisconsin is headed in the right direction."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/oct/24/republican-state-leadership-committee/nearly-all-wisconsin-job-creators-say-state-going-/	The Republican State Leadership Committee, a Washington, D.C.-based group that works to elect GOP lieutenant governors and other "down-ballot" state officials, is new to PolitiFact. And it is newly making an eye-popping claim -- albeit one quite similar to a claim we rated more than a year and a half ago. In a Wisconsin radio ad released Oct. 9, 2014, the GOP group promotes the campaign of Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch, who is running on the ticket with Gov. Scott Walker in the Nov. 4, 2014 election. They face Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke and her running mate, state Sen. John Lehman of Racine. The ad makes a number of boasts about the Walker-Kleefisch administration, including this one: "95 percent of job creators say Wisconsin is headed in the right direction." That's decidedly favorable; but, the way the group states it, also misleading. Previous claim Walker made a similar claim in February 2012, saying 94 percent of Wisconsin employers think the state "is heading in the right direction" and a majority say they will "grow their companies in 2012." We rated his statement Half True. Both numbers were correct. But they came from a small survey by the pro-Walker Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce of some of its members. The December 2011 survey of 281 chief executive officers amounted to a sample that is not reflective of the overall makeup of businesses in the state. For example, a majority of the survey respondents were manufacturing executives, but manufacturing establishments are just 6 percent of Wisconsin’s businesses. Walker, however, presented the statistics without noting the critical limitations. New survey WMC does its survey every other year. The latest one was conducted in November and December of 2013. This time, 95 percent of 341 CEOs said the state was going in the right direction. And that's the survey the national GOP group relies on in making its claim. But that claim has the same problems as the one Walker made. Our rating The Republican State Leadership Committee said: "95 percent of job creators say Wisconsin is headed in the right direction." The number is correct, but it comes from a small survey by one trade group and amounts to a sample that is not reflective of the overall makeup of state businesses. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-12734	"We've repealed regulations for the first time in 20 years using the Congressional Review Act -- three regulations that were going to cost the economy hundreds of millions of dollars and tens of thousands of jobs."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/02/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-repealing-3-regulations-saved-milli/	With a powerful Republican ally in the White House, Sen. Rand Paul said Congress is moving fast to reduce the burden of government regulations. On ABC’s This Week on Feb. 19, Paul, R-Ky., held up the deregulatory action taken by Congress as an example of the administration’s earliest weeks not being as chaotic as they may have seemed. "We repealed regulations for the first time in 20 years using the Congressional Review Act," Paul added. "Three regulations that were going to cost the economy hundreds of millions of dollars and tens of thousands of jobs." We decided to review Paul’s claim about whether the moves saved money and jobs. His statement hinges on analyses by the government and industry advocates, but they also occasionally contradict his point. The rules Under the Congressional Review Act, Congress can disapprove a rule by a simple majority vote, and then the president must sign off. Trump signed one disapproval on Feb. 14, which rejected a provision of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial regulation law. The rule required publicly traded mining, oil and gas companies to disclose their payments to governments. Another, signed Feb. 16, nullified the Stream Protection Rule, a rule created by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (within the Department of the Interior) to limit coal mining companies from releasing waste into waterways. Opponents of the rule said that it would reduce jobs in an already-contracting industry. Proponents said it would help keep ecosystems free of the toxic waste. The third disapproval, which Trump signed on Feb. 28 after Paul’s interview, concerned some provisions of the 2007 National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Intended to stop the mentally ill from obtaining guns, the rule required the Social Security Administration to share information about beneficiaries who do not manage their own benefits to the national background check system. Expected financial toll Paul’s claim that these regulations could cost "hundreds of millions of dollars" is reasonable, said Brian Mannix, a research professor at the George Washington University Regulatory Studies Center. He said many federal rules can cost much more than that, though it is difficult to say without a detailed analysis. We found some reports on the effects of the financial and environmental regulations. We did not, however, find a government report assessing costs or job impact for the rule on guns. The SEC estimated that 425 companies might be affected by the new financial disclosure regulation, with average total assets of $6.4 billion. The SEC also set compliance costs for the companies at $54.7 million to upwards of $700 million (the variation is due to variations in fixed costs), though they acknowledged "significant limitations" on their analysis that might have made it much lower. As for the cost of the Stream Protection Rule, the report prepared for the Office of Surface Mining and Enforcement’s estimated total U.S. compliance costs at $81.5 million (or 0.3 percent of estimated total annual revenue for the coal industry). That figure includes $63.6 million for operational costs, which includes commercial transport and reforestation. The government’s potential tax revenue loss to states was $995,000. Paul’s spokesman Sergio Gor sent us a study by Ranboll Environ that was prepared for the National Mining Association, a private group with public opposition to the rule. The study estimates the potential annual value of coal lost to production restriction is between $14 billion and $29 billion, with between $3.1 billion to $6.4 billion lost in state and federal tax revenue. The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement declined to comment on the record. Expected jobs impact The question of whether these regulations would save "tens of thousands" of jobs is more complex. On the disclosure rule, the SEC report did not comment on potential job increases or losses. And again, there is no estimate for jobs lost as a result of reduced reporting to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. As for the Stream Protection Rule, an impact analysis prepared for the Office of Surface Mining in November 2016 said the rule "would reduce employment by 124 jobs on average each year due to decreased coal mining," though the regulation might add 280 jobs in compliance efforts. The Ramboll Environ report stated that the Stream Protection Rule threatened 113,000 to 280,000 American mining jobs based on what it said was an independent analysis performed at 36 mines across the country. An expert said the government’s estimates are "much more reasonable" than the one completed for the mining association. "My take based on the available research is that the impact of the rule would be minimal," said Robert Godby, the director of the University of Wyoming Center for Energy Economics and Public Policy, said about the Stream Protection Rule. He said he thought that the NMA study conflated the potential effects of the Stream Protection Rule with other regulations enacted in 2009, and that the study didn’t account for other market factors that have caused larger downward trends in coal production. Our ruling Paul said that repealing three rules will save "hundreds of millions of dollars" and "tens of thousands of jobs." Studies of the regulations partially back up Paul’s claim, particularly in terms of financial burden. The evidence is less strong for his point about "tens of thousands" of jobs lost. The only information we could find for a regulation with a job-killing aspect is the stream protection rule. The government’s estimate said the rule could result in 124 lost mining positions a year (though compliance could result in the creation of more than twice as many). An industry-backed study offered a much more dramatic outlook for lost coal jobs, but one expert questioned its methodology. We rate this claim Half True. Correction: The Stream Protection Rule came from the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, which is a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Interior. An earlier version of this story incorrectly characterized the source of the rule. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Rand Paul	None	None	None	2017-03-02T17:38:04	2017-03-02	['None']

"Law passed: All child support in the United States will end by beginning of 2018," stated the headline on tmzbreaking, a website that describes itself as "the most notorious fauxtire & satire entertainment website in the world." Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The fake article has been circulating at least for a few months on Facebook. The end of the article directs readers to Channel50news, a prank website. The dateline on the story says Sept. 20, 2016, but when we read the oldest comments at the bottom of the story, they started on Sept. 20, 2017. Another hint that this is fake news is that the three-paragraph article has typos or sentences that make no sense: "President Trump claims he will no longer for any party of parent to pay child support. Trump also says that ant reports of abuse or negligence to a child from either party will result in the child automatically being turned over to the State Child Welfare." While this fake story suggests that the federal government is wiping out child support, it’s worth noting that states set child support policies and have enforcement programs. We emailed the authors of the website and did not get a reply. A story stated that a law will end all child support in the United States in 2018, but no such law has been passed.

pomt-00410	"While Richard Cordray was Attorney General, 12,000 rape kits like Allyssa's were left untested. Cordray's failure left serial rapists free to strike again. Then Mike DeWine became Attorney General. He tested all 12,000 rape kits. Now hundreds of rapists are behind bars."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2018/aug/30/mike-dewine/fact-checking-mike-dewines-attack-rich-cordray-abo/	Republican Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine said he has tested thousands of rape kits that his predecessor Richard Cordray had let languish. "While Richard Cordray was Attorney General, 12,000 rape kits like Allyssa's were left untested. Cordray's failure left serial rapists free to strike again," said DeWine’s TV ad narrated by rape survivor Allyssa Allison. "Then Mike DeWine became Attorney General. He tested all 12,000 rape kits. Now hundreds of rapists are behind bars." DeWine ousted Cordray in 2010. The two men are now facing off for governor. DeWine portrays Cordray as ignoring untested rape kits as they piled up. But the backlog of untested rape kits can’t be blamed mainly on the attorney general; local police departments had a role, too. The ad omits that Cordray started to address the backlog as it drew more attention in the summer of 2010, but he had little time left in office. Cordray’s actions on rape kits "Rape kits" are shorthand for sexual assault forensic evidence kits, which are collected soon after a sexual assault or rape. A nurse or a doctor collects evidence including tissue and hair samples from the victim’s body and clothing, including saliva, blood and semen. The evidence helps law enforcement investigate assaults. The ad said that while Cordray was attorney general, 12,000 rape kits were left untested, but they were not sitting around his office. That number reflects those that were sent in by police departments across the state once DeWine took over. Untested rape kits languishing in police evidence rooms had been a longstanding problem in many states when Cordray became Ohio attorney general in 2009. Some departments didn’t test the kits, citing hassles or cost. The national backlog continues today. During Cordray’s tenure, news coverage by the Cleveland Plain Dealer led to more scrutiny. Here’s what was known about untested kits when Cordray was in office. In July 2010, the Cleveland Police said they had found in their possession more than 6,000 rape kits going back to 1993, some of which had already been tested. The department decided it would start submitting all kits for testing to the state. By mid 2011, Cleveland began submitting untested kits in small batches to the state, according to a timeline written by Case Western Reserve University. While Cordray was attorney general, Ohio -- like much of the country -- had no consistent testing policy. Each law enforcement agency decided whether and how to test rape kits, which could be done at local labs or sent to the state. Cleveland police decided whether to test kits on a case by case basis. The Plain Dealer reported that the state Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation would test every kit Cleveland planned to send, though its preference was for departments to limit their submissions to evidence that officials thought would be most likely to provide leads. (BCI is under the purview of the attorney general.) Cordray in 2010 called for lawmakers, law enforcement officials and victim advocates to study best practices for testing and develop a statewide protocol. In his final months in office, Cordray formed the Ohio Sexual Assault Kit Testing Commission and announced that the state would receive new DNA-testing robots to speed up testing. Cordray then lost to DeWine. In a recent conference call with reporters, Cordray questioned why DeWine took seven years -- until he was in the middle of a campaign -- to clear out the backlog. "What he cannot explain is why it took him seven years to do a job he says I should have done in five months," he said. Cordray counterattacked with his own ad that featured Republican Shelby County Sheriff John Lenhart. The sheriff said that Cordray put the technology in place and "fixed" the backlog that had stretched for decades. That’s misleading -- while Cordray started to address the problem, he didn’t fix it. DeWine’s actions on rape kits DeWine took office in January 2011. A few months later he restarted the rape kit test commission after the Cleveland Heights police department misplaced evidence tied to Anthony Sowell, a serial killer and rapist. The Cleveland Plain Dealer wrote in an editorial in May 2011 that "building on an initiative of his predecessor, Richard Cordray, DeWine says he will stop sending DNA samples to private labs." Instead, the state would handle processing. In December 2011, DeWine announced that police should submit all kits for testing if a crime probably occurred. At the time, about half of sexual assault kits were submitted to the state crime labs. DeWine started a new unit with four forensic scientists to test the old kits and began the push to clear out the backlog in 2012. Six more scientists were added later. Though DeWine deserves credit for tackling the backlog, so does Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy McGinty. His office worked with Cleveland police to inventory rape kits, which resulted in identifying thousands of untested rape kits that were submitted to the state Bureau of Criminal Investigation in 2014. The General Assembly played a role, too. In 2014, Gov. John Kasich signed Senate Bill 316 to require law enforcement agencies to forward untested rape kits to the state or other crime labs within one year. In February 2018, DeWine announced that the state had analyzed 13,931 rape kits and had loaded more than 8,600 DNA profiles to a federal database used by law enforcement. (The TV ad cited 12,000 rape kits because it subtracted any rapes that occurred after Cordray left office.) DeWine said that charges had been filed against hundreds of attackers. The Cuyahoga County Prosecutor said that they have convicted 376 defendants between 2013 and 2018 largely based on rapes that occurred between 1993 and 2010, before DeWine took office. The average prison sentence is 11 years. Our ruling DeWine said in a TV ad, "While Richard Cordray was Attorney General, 12,000 rape kits like Allyssa's were left untested. Cordray's failure left serial rapists free to strike again. Then Mike DeWine became Attorney General. He tested all 12,000 rape kits. Now hundreds of rapists are behind bars." The ad leaves out a lot of context when it blames Cordray. First, it omits that Cordray inherited a statewide problem. Cordray started to take steps to address the problem, but didn’t get far before he was ousted by DeWine in November 2010. The ad is on firmer ground when it gives credit to DeWine for his efforts to clear out the backlog. But it omits that it took him several years to do it. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important context. We rate this statement Half True.

pomt-04139	Taxpayers are "on the hook ... for less than a third" of the proposed new Atlanta Falcons stadium, and those funds are "repaid from money that comes from outsiders."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/jan/04/nathan-deal/deal-makes-premature-claim-falcons-stadium-bid/	The public may be wary, but key elected officials are warming up to the idea of helping the Atlanta Falcons build a new stadium for the low, low price of $1 billion. Taxpayers would help finance a projected $300 million to construct the retractable-roof colossus, but boosters say the burden is smaller than it seems. A cautious Gov. Nathan Deal recently told WSB-TV reporter Lori Geary that the plan could make fiscal sense. "I think that, overall, if we get a new facility that’s upgraded and meets the current demands and needs of the future, then being ‘on the hook,’ so to speak, for less than a third – that is repaid from money that comes from outsiders – I think that’s probably a pretty good deal," the governor said. There’s got to be a catch, right? A stadium can cost more than the price of on-site construction. Off-site roads, bridges and other infrastructure may need upgrades to accommodate crowds. Looks like it’s time for the Truth-O-Meter. If the Falcons get their wish, the 20-year-old Georgia Dome would be razed in favor of a facility with luxury suites and other features that could boost the team’s bottom line. Skeptical taxpayers stand in their way. The public fully financed the Dome. But in the decades since, voters have soured on helping sports teams build new arenas. Under the current proposal, they would pitch in big time. The facility would be owned by the Georgia World Congress Center Authority, which owns the Dome, the Georgia World Congress Center and Centennial Olympic Park. Each year, a portion of the budgets for the Dome and World Congress Center come from a cut of an 8 percent tax on hotel and motel rooms within Atlanta’s city limits and unincorporated Fulton County. The GWCCA would help the Falcons pay for stadium construction with a bond backed by revenue it expects this tax to make over the next 30 years. The projected amount: about $300 million. We emailed Deal spokesman Brian Robinson for more information. He said the governor was speaking about the burden the stadium would put on state funds, and Deal overstated the cost. "In reality, it would come at no cost to STATE taxpayers," Robinson responded. We think viewers may have gotten the impression that Deal was talking about the total burden to taxpayers. The financing the governor mentioned in the interview would be backed by the local hotel/motel tax, not state funds. We’ll take both interpretations into account. This brings us to the first part of our fact check. Are taxpayers "on the hook ... for less than a third" of the stadium’s cost? This appears to be a matter of arithmetic. The $300 million contribution from local motel/hotel taxes is less than one-third of the projected $1 billion construction cost. If this were the only pot of public funds going to the stadium, then this portion of Deal’s claim would be correct. But there’s more to the story. In a "term sheet" approved in December that outlines the deal, both parties agreed that the GWCCA would buy land for the facility. Deal earmarked $15 million from the state budget in 2012 to buy land that could be used for the complex. Land acquisition costs could rise depending on which site planners select. In addition, roads and other infrastructure near the stadium may need hundreds of millions of dollars in upgrades. Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed said in September that these improvements could push the stadium’s total cost to $1.2 billion. This could push the cost to the public upward of $500 million. The Falcons expect to seek government help. The term sheet says that the GWCCA will cooperate with them "in pursuing other possible governmental funding sources with respect to such offsite infrastructure as may be required." Reed floated the possibility of using an additional $53 million in city economic development dollars. WXIA-TV recently reported that the stadium could receive millions of dollars in tax breaks from the state through an economic development program for projects of "regional significance." And furthermore, state money that the Georgia Department of Transportation gives local governments for road maintenance could be available, state DOT spokeswoman Jill Goldberg said. The project may be eligible for federal funds, too. Goldberg stressed, though, that no plans have been made, and the project may need no state money. Robinson told PolitiFact Georgia that he did not "foresee" state DOT money being used, but there are no set plans. "There’s too many unknowns at this juncture," Robinson said in an email. "There’s no deal at this time." Let’s move on to the second part of Deal’s claim. Will the public’s share of the cost really be paid for by "outsiders"? Not entirely. As we mentioned earlier, the GWCCA would use state funds to buy the site, and state, local and federal funds could be used for infrastructure. But the majority of the projected $300 million in hotel/motel taxes for stadium construction would be paid by outsiders. Some 86 percent of those who stay in hotels in unincorporated Fulton and the city of Atlanta are from out of state, Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau spokeswoman Lauren Jarrell said. Our ruling: Regardless of how you interpret Deal’s claim, it fell short. Yes, a large portion of the public’s contribution would come from local hotel/motel taxes, and these are overwhelmingly paid by "outsiders." But the state will buy land for the stadium, could chip in to help with hundreds of millions in infrastructure costs, and could provide substantial tax breaks. The total share for taxpayers could easily exceed $300 million. Deal’s claim is premature. And it leaves out important details. The governor gets a Half True.

pomt-12982	Say Bill Gates is linked to HPV vaccine related deaths in India.	pants on fire!	/global-news/statements/2016/dec/20/blog-posting/anti-vaccination-blog-revives-debunked-hpv-story/	The post on an anti-vaccination website was damning. The headline "Bill Gates uses 30,000 Indian girls as guinea pigs to test cancer vaccine," appeared on the Organic & Healthy blog in October and is still being shared. The article described a 2009 human papillomavirus vaccination demonstration project in India. In the span of about a year, thousands of girls between the ages of 10 and 14 received one of two vaccines to prevent genital warts that are linked to cancer later in life. According to the blog, the project went terribly wrong. In one Indian state, "some of the girls’ health deteriorated and five of them died the next year," the article said. In a second state, "two deaths were reported." One of our readers saw the blog post and asked us to check it out. We did and as with many false claims, it takes a thread of fact and weaves a blanket of misinformation. We specifically looked at whether the vaccinations led to any deaths. First, a little background on human papillomavirus, or HPV. HPV causes genital warts and cervical precancers that can lead to a variety of cancers. In the United States for example, HPV is responsible for over 30,000 cancers each year. Several vaccines to prevent the warts and precancers came on the market in 2006. Since then, about 200 million doses have been administered worldwide. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for the most common virus strains, the vaccines "provide close to 100 percent protection against cervical precancers and genital warts." So, what happened in India? In 2007, the Indian government’s Council of Medical Research and two state governments laid the groundwork for a project to see whether these vaccines could be delivered cost-effectively in lower income communities. An international nonprofit PATH was directly responsible for the work. The vaccinations began in 2009 and by March 2010, they had vaccinated about 24,000 girls between the ages of 10 and 14. The effort was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and in addition to India, it took place in Peru, Uganda and Vietnam. The trouble began when local newspapers reported several deaths linked to the vaccinations. In October 2009, a coalition of community organizations and health activists called for a halt to the project. Their cries grew more insistent. In an April 2007 letter to the Minister of Health, in addition to the deaths, they said over 120 girls had suffered everything from mood swings to epileptic seizures. The government agreed to stop. No deaths The government commissioned a group of physicians and researchers to investigate whether the vaccination program caused any deaths. In February 2011, the group reported there was no connection. One girl drowned. Insecticide poisoning killed two others. Two others had severe malaria. One was bitten by a poisonous snake and one died from a disease that physicians said "can not be linked possibly to HPV." No reputable study has ever tied the vaccine to a death. The vaccines can have side effects, including fever, headache, fainting and nausea. But according to many studies cited by the CDC, these pass quickly. Not guinea pigs The article paints a picture of global pharmaceutical companies experimenting on unsuspecting young, poor girls. In fact, the vaccines have gone through years of testing and have become commonplace in the wealthiest nations. Australia provides it to every girl and boy between 12 and 13 years old in public school. Vaccinations are routine in France, Germany and Holland. The vaccines are on the market in over 100 countries and the World Health Organization recommends it as part of the national immunization program for any nation that can afford it. A problem of process A 2010 article in the British medical journal Lancet assessed what went wrong in India. Its basic conclusion? Officials were too slow to respond when local concerns first emerged. "Reluctance by public health authorities to respond to issues of public distrust for fear that they will exacerbate the problem is dangerous," the authors wrote. The repercussions lasted for some time. In 2013, an Indian parliamentary panel chastised PATH, the international nonprofit, along with its Indian partners for failing to fully inform the parents of the girls of what they were doing and not having a system in place to track any side effects. Our ruling An anti-vaccination blog tied Bill Gates to the deaths of several girls who were part of an HPV vaccination roll out in India. A full medical investigation determined that the girls died from causes completely unrelated to the vaccine. Some were poisoned by insecticide, malaria took others, and one drowned. Many millions of young girls and boys have received the vaccine over the years and while there are some common side effects, they are mild. The blog post is a mash-up of outdated rumors that were disproven years ago. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-06801	When Standard & Poor's "dropped our credit rating, what they said is, we don't have an ability to repay our debt. ... I was proved right in my position" that the debt ceiling should not have been raised.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/12/michele-bachmann/bachmann-said-standard-poors-downgrade-proved-she-/	If you made a list of House Republicans who were the biggest opponents of raising the debt ceiling, Michele Bachmann would be near the top. Bachmann, R-Minn., and a Republican candidate for president, said consistently that she would not vote for an increase in the debt ceiling -- the legal limit on how much money the government can borrow -- regardless of the terms of the deal. She repeated her opposition at a Republican debate in Ames, Iowa, on Aug. 11, 2011, when asked if she was concerned about the United States defaulting and not paying its debts. "If you had your way, the debt ceiling would not have been raised," said Susan Ferrechio, a debate moderator. "What do you say to analysts who insist that Americans' investments, their 401(k)s, their college funds would have been far worse off today?" "I think we just heard from Standard & Poor's," Bachmann said. "When they dropped our credit rating, what they said is, we don't have an ability to repay our debt. That's what the final word was from them. I was proved right in my position. We should not have raised the debt ceiling. And instead, we should have cut government spending, which was not done. And then we needed to get our spending priorities in order." Is that what Standard & Poor's said? And did the report support her position that the debt ceiling should not have been raised? Her statement was a disputed point in the post-debate analysis, so we decided to check it out for ourselves. (We should also note that her claim that the deal did not cut government spending is questionable at best. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said that the deal would cut "at least $2.1 trillion" between 2012 and 2021.) A little background: Standard & Poor's is a New York-based ratings agency that studies the financial markets. It issues guidance to investors and rates various investments for financial risk. On Aug. 5, it downgraded its credit rating for the United States one notch, from the top-rated AAA to AA+. (The other two ratings agencies, Moody's and Fitch, did not lower the U.S. rating.) The Obama administration strongly objected to the ratings downgrade and disputed Standard & Poor's analysis. Others criticized the company for its performance in previous years, when it gave high ratings to mortgage securities that subsequently proved worthless. The downgrade didn't seem to have much effect on investors' desire to hold U.S. Treasury bonds and other securities, which are still widely perceived as safe investments. Bachmann said that when Standard & Poor's dropped the rating, "what they said is, we don't have an ability to repay our debt" and she said it supported her position that the ceiling should not have been raised and that spending should have simply been cut. Bachmann also opposed any type of tax increases, including closing loopholes, which Democrats supported. To fact-check Bachmann, we read Standard & Poor's original report on why it issued its downgrade. To put it in simple terms, Standard & Poor's had two main reasons for the downgrade: First, that the size of the U.S. debt is very large and growing, and second, that politicians seem unable to agree on what steps to take to reduce it. It called the political process "contentious and fitful," and said the firm was "pessimistic" that the White House and Congress would be able to agree on measures to significantly reduce the debt anytime soon. "The political brinksmanship of recent months highlights what we see as America's governance and policymaking becoming less stable, less effective, and less predictable than what we previously believed. The statutory debt ceiling and the threat of default have become political bargaining chips in the debate over fiscal policy," the report said. The report does not say that the debt ceiling should not have been raised. If anything, there's an unstated assumption that increasing the debt ceiling was necessary. "The statutory debt ceiling and the threat of default have become political bargaining chips in the debate over fiscal policy," the report said. And in an interview on Fox News, Standard & Poors' managing director John Chambers seemed to express disapproval that it took so long for Congress to raise the debt ceiling. He said President Barack Obama "characterized the political system as dysfunctional, I think that's a good word. We got to a position where we were within 10 hours of having a major cash flow problem. This is not what happens in other countries," Chambers said on Aug. 8. Another official with Standard & Poor's, director Joydeep Mukherji, told POLITICO that the stability of American political institutions were undermined by the fact that "people in the political arena were even talking about a potential default." He didn't mention who those people were. "That a country even has such voices, albeit a minority, is something notable," he added. "This kind of rhetoric is not common amongst AAA sovereigns." As to which political party was in the right, the ratings agency did not explicitly tip its hand. The report said it took no position on whether taxes should be raised or spending should be cut. In the Fox News interview, Chambers was asked if the tea party movement was responsible for the downgrade as Democrats alleged. He declined to take the bait and assign blame. "I think that there's lots of blame to go around, and what we need to come to in the United States is a way of forging consensus, so that we can take the tough choices that lie ahead, because the fiscal situation in the United States is not sustainable," he said. Bachmann said that when Standard & Poor's "dropped our credit rating, what they said is, we don't have an ability to repay our debt. That's what the final word was from them. I was proved right in my position. I was proved right in my position." In fact, because the debt ceiling was raised, the United States is paying its debts. What Standard & Poor's actually said was that politicians in Washington can't agree on long-term solutions for how to reduce the debt -- not that the country is or was unable to pay its debts. The notion that the report supported her position is wishful thinking. For that, we rate her statement False.	None	Michele Bachmann	None	None	None	2011-08-12T18:27:11	2011-08-11	['None']
pomt-11335	A recent stomach virus outbreak at the beleaguered Quincy Veterans’ Home shows Gov. Bruce Rauner "is letting persistent health issues jeopardize the wellbeing of our nation’s heroes."	mostly false	/illinois/statements/2018/apr/10/jb-pritzker/facts-bug-new-pritzker-attack-line-quincy-veterans/	Gov. Bruce Rauner has faced a barrage of criticism for his administration’s response to deadly outbreaks of Legionnaires’ disease at the state’s Quincy Veterans’ Home, which since 2015 have claimed the lives of 13 residents and sickened dozens of others. Now, Rauner’s re-election rival, Democrat J.B. Pritzker, is taking another Quincy-related swing at the governor following disclosure in late March by the Illinois Department of Public Health that 24 individuals at the state-run facility had been sickened by what appeared to be norovirus, a gastrointestinal illness that sometimes causes severe vomiting and diarrhea. "After fatally mismanaging the Quincy Veterans’ Home, @BruceRauner is letting persistent health issues jeopardize the wellbeing of our nation’s heroes," Pritzker said in a March 30 tweet. "This is a shameful display of failed leadership." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The Pritzker tweet linked to an article in the Chicago Sun-Times about the stomach bug sweeping through the Quincy facility. The article also included other tweets from Democratic state lawmakers pinning the norovirus outbreak on Rauner. Rauner, a Republican, has been the target of bipartisan criticism for his administration’s handling of Legionnaires’ at Quincy after problems were brought to light by a WBEZ investigation last December. The Chicago public radio station raised questions about how patients were treated upon falling ill and revealed officials delayed informing the public after the disease surfaced. Critics have also blasted the Rauner administration for its delay in executing a long-term solution for eradicating the disease at the facility. But is the recent emergence of an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness at the Quincy home really an example of more of the same? And is there anything Rauner could have done, or should be doing, to prevent or mitigate the impact of the severe stomach bug residents have come down with at the home? Hand to mouth State health officials suspect norovirus is the culprit behind the latest outbreak at the home in downstate Quincy. The virus, which results in acute gastroenteritis, is the most common cause of diarrhea and vomiting both in the United States and globally, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most stricken recover within days, although the illness can pose serious threats to those with compromised immune systems, with the majority of deaths occurring among the elderly. As a viral infection, no antibiotic can treat it. Individuals catch Legionnaires’ disease, on the other hand, by inhaling bacteria that thrives in poorly maintained water systems — something government management and oversight can control. The disease, which produces a severe form of pneumonia, requires treatment with antibiotics. The state health department reported on March 30 that 24 individuals, including both residents and staff, had fallen ill with stomach symptoms at the the veterans’ home, but said none of the cases were serious and that the patients were recovering. But this is general election campaign season, and both the Pritzker and Rauner camps are gearing up for a cutthroat and costly fight in which facts and nuance often take a back seat to any opportunity to raise doubt about an opponent. In that climate, stark distinctions between Legionnaires’ and norovirus can get kicked to the curb. Norovirus afflicts some 20 million people in the U.S. annually, unlike Legionnaires’, which resulted in 6,000 cases being reported to the CDC in 2015. The viral infection is spread through close contact with an infected person or by consuming food or water contaminated by an infected person, according to the CDC. It takes exposure to just a small amount of particles from an infected individual’s stools or vomit to spread the bug. That means enclosed places like nursing homes and assisted-living facilities, such as those at Quincy, as well as schools and cruise ships, are particularly vulnerable. Long-term care facilities play host to the virus more than any other location. They account for between two-thirds and three-quarters of the more than 1,000 norovirus outbreaks that occur annually nationwide, according to Dr. Benjamin Lopman, a professor at Emory University who worked as an epidemiologist with the CDC for seven years. Since 2014, Illinois has experienced 870 norovirus outbreaks, with 540 of them occurring in settings for the elderly such as Quincy, according to data from the Illinois Department of Public Health. "Noroviruses are exclusively human pathogens," Lopman said, explaining that makes the goal to stop transmission from person to person by isolating those who’ve developed symptoms. But because norovirus can also contaminate the environments where people get sick, with particles landing on surfaces that others may later touch, vigilant handwashing is also a must. Beyond that, the response of a care facility is limited. We asked Lopman what, if anything, management at a facility for seniors such as Quincy could do in the way of front-end prevention. "That is very difficult because … it’s very common in the community," he said. "It’s hard to stop someone coming in," between visitors who don’t appear symptomatic and new patient intakes. So we asked the Pritzker campaign to explain how the norovirus outbreak at Quincy could be construed as a blot on Rauner’s leadership. A spokesman for Pritzker responded with an emailed statement that avoided the question and dwelled on the Legionnaires’ issue. "The fact is, Rauner let the Legionnaires’ crisis spiral out of control in Quincy and is now leaving the same residents and staff to contend with both Legionnaires’ and new diseases as he fails to put forward a permanent solution that keeps veterans safe," the Pritzker campaign statement read. A follow-up query to Pritzker spokeswoman Galia Slayen shed no more light on the original question. "We think our statement is pretty clear in that he has failed to do anything to address health crises at the Quincy Veterans’ Home," Slayen said. Our ruling Pritzker’s March 30 tweet held out a recent norovirus outbreak that sickened two dozen individuals at a state-run veterans’ facility in Quincy as evidence of how Rauner had been "letting persistent health issues jeopardize the wellbeing of our nation’s heroes." Rauner has been under fire for his administration’s handling of deadly outbreaks of Legionnaires’ disease at the facility. Yet unlike Legionnaires’, which is contracted by inhaling water vapor contaminated with the bacteria, the stomach bug state health officials suspect caused the latest Quincy health problems is spread from person to person, rendering a case for structural mismanagement something of a stretch. Norovirus spreads most frequently in closed environments like nursing homes and assisted living facilities such as Quincy. There is no specific cure for it, meaning the response from care providers is largely limited to isolating patients, casting doubt on what Rauner or his administration could have done to prevent or eliminate it. Asked how Rauner bears blame for the gastroenteritis outbreak, Pritzker’s campaign did not directly respond, instead attempting to characterize it as further evidence after the Legionnaires’ problems at Quincy that the Republican should not be trusted to handle any health issue at the state facility. That conflates two very different epidemiological challenges, and leaves an impression--disputed by experts--that more could have, and should have, been done to stop the spread of norovirus at Quincy. For that, we rate Pritzker’s claim as Mostly False.	None	JB Pritzker	None	None	None	2018-04-10T07:00:00	2018-03-30	['None']
pomt-10339	Obama "voted against funding our troops."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/21/john-mccain/mccain-cites-one-protest-vote/	An ad for Sen. John McCain makes the case that Sen. Barack Obama is a foreign policy lightweight who has voted against funding for troops. "Barack Obama never held a single Senate hearing on Afghanistan," an announcer states. "He hasn't been to Iraq in years. He voted against funding our troops — positions that helped him win his nomination. Now Obama is changing to help himself become president. John McCain has always supported our troops and the surge that's working." See our story for details about the ad's other claims. Here we'll look at Obama's votes on troop funding. The McCain campaign supported its claim that Obama voted against troop funding by citing a May 2007 Senate vote. The campaign is correct that Obama voted against a bill to fund troops, which passed anyway. Obama's vote came after Democrats had sought unsuccessfully to attach a timetable for withdrawing troops. After that language was removed, Obama and several other senators decided to vote against the measure, saying they could not rubber-stamp an open-ended occupation. (See our previous coverage of this issue .) "This country is united in our support for our troops, but we also owe them a plan to relieve them of the burden of policing someone else's civil war," Obama said at the time. "Gov. (Mitt) Romney and Sen. McCain clearly believe the course we are on in Iraq is working, but I do not." The vote came when the primary contest for both the Democratic and Republican nominations was wide open, seven months before the first primaries. Obama and fellow candidates Chris Dodd and Hillary Clinton voted against the bill; Republicans at the time said the vote showed the three failed to support the troops. Clinton, then the Democratic front-runner, was asked whether the vote would prove troubling later, an idea she dismissed. In 2008, Obama voted for a troop funding bill that passed overwhelmingly, 92-6. McCain was absent. Obama's campaign responded to the attack by pointing to Obama's support for bills that would increase benefits to veterans. McCain opposed the bills because he believed the new benefits would encourage active military to leave the service prematurely. The McCain campaign is correct that Obama voted against the 2007 funding measure. But the ad's statement — "he voted against funding our troops" — is phrased with no qualifications or caveats. Actually, Obama has voted for troop funding several times in other measures. So we find the claim in the McCain ad to be Half True.

pomt-07596	"Most Americans live within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/24/lawrence-odonnell/msnbcs-lawrence-odonnell-most-americans-live-withi/	On MSNBC's Last Word on March 22, 2011, host Lawrence O'Donnell argued that evacuation plans for nuclear power plants in the United States are an unrealistic "fantasy" due to the huge population concentrations around them. That's especially the case, he said, if there were a call to evacuate a 50-mile radius -- the distance the U.S. government recently urged Americans to evacuate around an earthquake-damaged Japanese nuclear power plant. "The truth is, most Americans live within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant," O'Donnell said. O'Donnell and his guest, Daniel Aldrich, author of Site Fights, used the example of the Indian Point nuclear power plant in New York. A 50-mile radius around that plant alone includes almost all of New York City, and large chunks of northern New Jersey -- more than 8 million people. Aldrich said evacuating a 50-mile radius around the Indian Point plant would cause a "tremendous amount of confusion and chaos as people locally flee and try to preserve themselves." Said O'Donnell: "There is no real evacuation plan from a place like Indian Point." The nuclear disaster in Japan naturally causes people to consider how a similar disaster might play out In the United States. So we were curious about O'Donnell's claim that most Americans live within 50 miles of a power plant. We turned first to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which oversees emergency response plans in the event of a nuclear accident. The website includes a map of all the nuclear power reactors in operation in the U.S., so you can see how far away you live from one. According to a Federal Emergency Management Agency analysis using 2000 census data, there were 184 million people who lived within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant in the U.S., the NRC reported. According to the U.S. Census, there were 281 million people living in the U.S. in 2000. So by our math, about 65 percent of the U.S. population lives within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant. "They typically build power plants where there are large populations," said Patricia Milligan, senior technical advisor for emergency preparation and response at the NRC. "Populations need power. They kind of go hand-in-hand." You could put power plants out in the middle of South Dakota, she said, but then the expense to transport the energy would be very high. So O'Donnell's statistic was accurate. But Milligan takes issue with O'Donnell's conclusion that evacuation plans are unrealistic. The decision for the 50-mile evacuation in Japan was based on several unique factors, she said. First, she said, "the communication coming out of Japan was confusing and contradictory." In addition, she said, you had three reactors with significant core damage, and two spent fuel pools "appeared to be significantly compromised." She's "completely confident" the complicating factors that led to the 50-mile evacuation recommendation in Japan wouldn't happen in the U.S. The NRC has "extremely good communication with the licensees." They also have an electronic reporting system, so they get the same information as the power plant operators in live-time. "We're in a much better position to access and evaluate information," she said. Emergency evacuation plans in the U.S. focus on 10-mile zones. Most accidents would not trigger an emergency response outside that 10-mile radius, Milligan said. But states and power plant operators are required to make emergency response plans for areas within 50 miles as well, including such things as protection of the food supply. While it's true that most Americans live within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant, those percentages drop off markedly when you consider 10- or 20-mile zones. According to FEMA data, about 8 percent of the American population lives within 20 miles of a nuclear power plant; and about 1.7 percent lives within 10 miles. In other words, while power plants are usually located near large population centers, "they tend to put them in the outer suburbs," Milligan said. Evacuations are an integral part of the emergency response plan, Milligan said. The NRC has done extensive study of emergency evacuations (for everything from floods to wildfires to gas leaks), and the agency is convinced they are feasible and realistic. "Evacuations do save lives," Milligan said. "They happen all the time in the United States, and they work well." But back to O'Donnell's statistic. He said most Americans live within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant. About 65 percent of the population in 2000 lived within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant. That's certainly most. We rate O'Donnell's statement True.	None	Lawrence O'Donnell	None	None	None	2011-03-24T15:03:37	2011-03-22	['United_States']
pomt-08260	As mayor, Barrett led efforts to redevelop the Menomonee Valley, "which now supports nearly 4,000 jobs in Wisconsin."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2010/nov/11/tom-barrett/tom-barrett-says-he-helped-create-4000-jobs-menomo/	Once the industrial heart of the state of Wisconsin, over the decades the Menomonee Valley gradually deteriorated into a high profile eyesore. Polluted, smelly, and ugly ... all were used to describe the stretch of land from roughly the 6th Street viaduct to what is now Miller Park. Though hundreds of people worked there -- at the stockyards, gear manufacturer Falk Corp., railroad switching yards and other industries -- the area was best known for acre upon acre of brownfields. Local historian John Gurda noted the economic importance of the valley but said "its persistent pollution problems and the generalized ugliness of much of its development made the district a civic embarrassment to some Milwaukeeans." Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett put a different spin on it during his unsuccessful campaign for governor against Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker, saying under his leadership the city had turned the area into a job-creating machine. In a video, Barrett compared the jobs created in the valley to the lack of development on county-owned land in the Park East freeway corridor, claiming: "Tom Barrett redeveloped the Menomonee Valley, which now supports nearly 4,000 jobs in Wisconsin." The election is over, but we were still wondering about that claim. Without a doubt, the recession cost the Milwaukee area thousands of jobs. The state Department of Workforce Development says metro area employment is 798,400, down about 65,000 jobs from December 2007, when the recession began. But this claim relates to a different time frame -- since Barrett took office -- and a specific area. So was the city able to add thousands of jobs in the valley? In an word: yes. But the work didn’t start with Barrett, who took office in 2004. There have been several master plans cooked up for the valley over the decades until the current onetook effect in 1998. As far back as 1977, Mayor Henry Maier saw the valley’s potential, saying: "The Menomonee Valley redevelopment project is probably the largest industrial revitalization project in the country, and I am determined that it will also be the best." Maier’s successor , Mayor John O. Norquist, spent years fighting for control of a key piece of valley property -- 134 acres held by CMC Heartland Partners, the parent company of the old Milwaukee Road railroad. The city finally wrested control of that site in 2003 for $6.8 million. That move in particular cleared the way for a city-owned Menomonee Valley Industrial Center. Additionally, moves under Norquist -- such as bringing the 6th Steet Viaduct down to the valley level -- improved access. The bridge previously stretched across the valley. What did Barrett do since taking office? According to Rocky Marcoux, head of the Department of City Development, the city has spent some $48 million in public improvements -- cleaning polluted "brownfields," site preparation and so forth -- and created seven tax incremental financing districts. It also spent $25 million to extend Canal St., which runs down the center of the valley, so it links up with the freeway at Miller Park. That’s important because it gives another easy way for traffic to reach businesses there. Marcoux said the city can offer business owners lots that compare with suburban industrial parks: "We can offer them land at market rates. We don’t have to induce them." A quick tally of the major additions to the valley on Barrett’s watch: Recreation-related: The Harley-Davidson Museum, Iron Horse Hotel, and Potawatomi Casino expansion. Combined, 1,332 jobs. Industrial park: From the first industrial park tenant, pizza maker Palermo Villa Inc., which has grown from 180 to about 500 jobs, to the most recent addition, windmill generator-maker Ingeteam. Combined 1,156 jobs. Others: An assortment of jobs retained (Cargill) and new ones (such as Zimmerman Design Group, Proven Direct). Combined: 1,671 jobs. That tallies out to 4,159 jobs, a figure deemed accurate by Laura Bray, executive director of the Menomonee Valley Partners, a nonprofit group established to promote business development in the area. It also corresponds with coverage in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel by commercial real estate reporter Tom Daykin. In all, about 10,000 people work in the valley -- a figure Bray called a rough estimate because there has not been a recent detailed study of total employment. And some 26 companies have moved or expanded in the valley, according to the Menomonee Valley Partners. In some cases, expansion hasn’t gone according to plan. For instance, Harley originally expected to build an office complex with nearly 400 jobs near its museum, but those plans have been on hold since the economy tanked. Nevertheless, there is plenty to look at in assessing Barrett’s claim. As a former candidate for governor, and current civic cheerleader, Mayor Tom Barrett boasts of creating thousands of jobs in the Menomonee Valley. While overall jobs in the city are down, and Barrett came into office with some key assets put in place by his predecessors, our tally puts new jobs in the valley since 2004 at more than 4,000. We rate Barrett’s statement True.	None	Tom Barrett	None	None	None	2010-11-11T09:00:00	2010-11-10	['Wisconsin']
